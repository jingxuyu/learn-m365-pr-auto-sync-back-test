Microsoft 365 subscribers have a variety of support options. The particulars depend on your Microsoft 365 subscription, the service package included, the service or tool in question, and the source of support. In general, you can get help in the following ways:
- **Cloud Service Provider Tier 1 support**. If you got your Microsoft 365 subscription through a Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) that is certified as a Tier 1 CSP, contact them directly for technical support. Under this model, your Tier 1 CSP can provision your Microsoft 365 tenant for you, and act as your first point of contact for all service-related issues. Tier 1 providers will escalate any issues they can’t resolve directly to Microsoft to ensure that you get the help you need.
- **Telephone support**. Some Microsoft 365 components provide phone support. For more information about languages, regions, and phone numbers, go to [Contact support for business products - Admin Help](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&tabs=phone). 
- **Microsoft 365 support forums**. Microsoft offers many official support forums where you can ask questions and get answers from both Microsoft and community members. Different technologies and services in Microsoft 365 have their own forums. Some of the more popular ones are:
   - [**Azure forums**](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/community/) 
   - [**Windows forums**](https://answers.microsoft.com/windows/forum?sort=LastReplyDate&dir=Desc&tab=All&status=all&mod=&modAge=&advFil=&postedAfter=&postedBefore=&threadType=All&isFilterExpanded=false&page=1)
   - [**Office forums**](https://answers.microsoft.com/msoffice/forum?sort=LastReplyDate&dir=Desc&tab=All&status=all&mod=&modAge=&advFil=&postedAfter=&postedBefore=&threadType=All&isFilterExpanded=false&page=1)
- **Automated assistance bot**. The Microsoft 365 admin center has an automated assistance bot that’s designed to help you find answers to support questions. Accessed from the **Need help** button, the bot known as "O365 Assistant" offers a chat-based user experience with natural language capabilities.

- **Premier Support**. Microsoft Premier Support Services is well suited for large or global enterprises with strategic and organizations-critical dependence on Microsoft products, including Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure. If you are a Premier Support Services member, you'll be assigned a technical account manager, and additional benefits such as advisory services and on-site support are available. Premier Support Engineers are assigned customer issues and can call in any other Microsoft expertise that’s required to solve the problem. So if you call in with a support issue for SharePoint Online that involves networking, Azure, and Skype for Business, for example, the Support Engineer can draw on those teams for you.
