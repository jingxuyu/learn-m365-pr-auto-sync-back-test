Most security breaches are a result of attackers stealing a user’s identity. Over the years, attackers have become increasingly effective in leveraging third-party breaches and using sophisticated phishing attacks. As soon as an attacker gains access to even low privileged user accounts, it's relatively easy for them to gain access to important company resources. 

To help protect your user’s identities, you need to: 
- Protect all identities regardless of their privilege level
- Proactively prevent compromised identities from being abused

Protect identities in your Microsoft 365 environment with:
- **Azure AD Identity Protection**. User accounts are critical to helping identify users, so you need to be able to identify unusual account behavior. This helps you identify attempts to compromise accounts, possibly by a hacker or other malicious person. When Azure AD Identity Protection detects unusual account behavior, it can block account access, or perhaps require additional authentication options. 
- **Microsoft Cloud app security**. Analytics for your cloud apps and services, helping security teams better understand the protections for critical data across cloud apps.
- **Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)**. A cloud-based security solution that identifies, detects, and helps you investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.
- **Windows 10**. Built-in identity protection capabilities help protect user identities. For example, Windows Hello, a biometric authentication feature that helps strengthen authentication and guard against potential spoofing by using fingerprint matching and facial recognition, is built right into the OS.
