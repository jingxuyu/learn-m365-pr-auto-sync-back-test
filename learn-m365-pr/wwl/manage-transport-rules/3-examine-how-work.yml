quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which transport rule component identifies the messages that the actions shouldn't apply to?"
    choices:
    - content: "Exceptions"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Exceptions are an optional component, since they identify the messages that the actions shouldn't apply to. The same message identifiers that are available in conditions are also available in exceptions. Exceptions override conditions and prevent the rule actions from being applied to a message, even if the message matches all the configured conditions."
    - content: "Conditions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Conditions identify the messages to which you want to apply the actions that are defined in the rule. Try again."
    - content: "Properties"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Properties specify other rules settings that aren't conditions, exceptions, or actions. Try again."
