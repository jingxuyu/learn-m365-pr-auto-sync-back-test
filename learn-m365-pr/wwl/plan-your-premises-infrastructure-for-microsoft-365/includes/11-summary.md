As you plan your migration to Microsoft 365, it's essential you plan the on-premises infrastructure needed to support your migration to the Microsoft cloud. To support that planning effort, this module discussed some of the networking decisions that must be made to ensure an optimal migration experience, and the best experience for your users after migration.

To assist you as you plan your deployment, we recommended using a pre-deployment checklist. A checklist of this nature enables companies to create timelines and set goals and subtasks that will help keep their Microsoft 365 deployments on schedule. Having a model to follow improves quality of life by helping you manage key benchmarks so they don’t become insurmountable.

If your company has difficulty coming up with a planning checklist, Microsoft provides a Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365 that can get you started. You can then customize this list as per your organization's business requirements. In this module, we reviewed Microsoft’s Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365, and we examined the following steps in greater detail:

 *  Cleaning up your Active Directory
 *  Planning your mail migration
 *  Planning your data storage

This module also examined how you can estimate your organization's network bandwidth requirements to support Microsoft 365. It also introduced the tools that Microsoft provides to help you validate your network readiness.

We finished this module by examining how to create a deployment strategy to implement Microsoft 365 services. Microsoft 365, together with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), provides different avenues for companies to authenticate into its services. This module examined the different strategies for implementing Microsoft 365 services.<br>
