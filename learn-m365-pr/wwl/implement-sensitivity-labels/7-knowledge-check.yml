  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Tailspin Toys deleted a sensitivity label that applied to one of its SharePoint sites. What's the typical length of time that it takes for the label to be removed and the label settings to no longer be enforced on the site?"
    choices:
    - content: "24 to 48 hours"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't how long it takes for the label to be removed and the settings no longer enforced."
    - content: "48 to 72 hours"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you delete a sensitivity label that applies to containers such as a SharePoint site, the label is removed and any settings that were configured with that label are no longer enforced. This action typically takes between 48 to 72 hours for SharePoint sites."
    - content: "The changes are immediately enforced on the SharePoint site"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The changes aren't enforced immediately on the SharePoint site."
  - content: "Fabrikam created a custom sensitivity label for highly confidential data. It tested the label during the pilot phase of its data protection project by assigning the label to a label policy. In turn, the policy was assigned to a select group of users on the project team. Now that its testing phase is complete, Fabrikam is ready to roll out the label across the entire organization. What should it do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a new label and then assign it to a new label policy that specifies all users"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A single label is reusable. It can be included in several label policies at one time. Fabrikam doesn't have to create a new label."
    - content: "Assign the existing label to a new label policy that specifies all users"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. A single label is reusableâ€”you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users. For example, you could pilot your sensitivity labels by assigning a label policy to just a few users. Then when you're ready to roll out the labels across your organization, you can create a new label policy for your labels and this time, specify all users."
    - content: "Delete the existing label, create a new label, and assign it to a new label policy that specifies all users"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't have to delete the existing label."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Allan Deyoung is implementing sensitivity labels. Which of the following items is a recommended practice that Allan should implement when publishing labels?"
    choices:
    - content: "Publish a sensitivity label policy for each group in the company"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Aim to have as few label policies as possible. It's not uncommon to have just one label policy for the entire organization."
    - content: "Delete labels from a policy because it's less risky than removing labels from a policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deleting a label from a policy is actually riskier than removing a label from a policy."
    - content: "Have as few label policies as possible"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Multiple label policies are needed only if users need different labels or different policy settings. Organizations should plan to have as few label policies as possible. It's not uncommon to have just one label policy for an entire organization."
