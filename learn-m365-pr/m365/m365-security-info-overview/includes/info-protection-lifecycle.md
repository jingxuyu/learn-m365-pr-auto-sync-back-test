Let’s look at the journey of a file and discuss how Microsoft technologies can help protect the data within that file.

**File is created**

- Regardless of where the file is created, Sensitivity labeling in Office apps can enforce information protection based on the labels attached to the data.

**User edits the file**

- Based on the content being created or modified in the file, the label can be updated based on the sensitivity of the content, ensuring the right protection is applied to the file.

**User shares the file with another user in the organization**

- As an additional layer of protection, Data Loss Prevention policies in Office 365 helps prevent the accidental or inadvertent sharing of sensitive documents and emails.

**User opens the file on their phone**

- If a user receives and opens the data on a mobile device, Intune enforces protection of the data.

**User uploads the file to another cloud service such as Dropbox**

- If a user uploads the data to other clouds for external sharing, services such as Microsoft Cloud App Security can apply policies based on the data’s labels.
