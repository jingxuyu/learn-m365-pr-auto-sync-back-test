Your organization most likely has a file recovery strategy in place to recover user data that is stored on network file servers or network-accessible storage devices. However, it is important to remember that users often save their work to their local devices. Therefore, it is important that you provide some method of local file recovery, so that you can recover these data files if users delete them accidentally or they become corrupt.

In this module, you will learn about the Windows file backup and recovery tools. Previous Windows versions allowed users to view and recover files that they modified or deleted by mistake, and Windows offers similar tools, including the:

 -  Backup and Restore (Windows 7) tool, which provides backup and recovery functionality.
 -  File History feature, which protects user data by copying it periodically to a local or network drive. Users then can recover files, as necessary.
 -  Azure Backup tool, which stores Windows data to Microsoft Azure (in the cloud). However, before you can use this tool, you must create a backup vault in Microsoft Azure, and install Microsoft Azure Backup agent on Windows.
