A **service request** creates a support case that formalizes a user’s request to Microsoft Support for help. These requests can be made through different channels including telephone support, online chat support, and email. Each customer case is identified by a unique code that helps track the request through the support process until the issue is resolved and the case is closed. You can reopen a case using the same number in a new request call, but only if it’s for the exact same problem or error. Bundling more than one issue into a request causes difficulty when Support Engineers need to build a history of what’s happened in your environment and causes problems for tracking larger issues. Finally, it hides trends that may be affecting an entire product. Each service request should be about a specific issue or error message that you include when you file the request for the first time.

## Creating a service request
The Microsoft 365 admin center provides an integrated interface where administrators can create a new service request and view the status of any existing requests. As shown in the following image, you first must toggle off the O365 Assistant bot within the Support pane. You then type in a description of your issue, search for solutions, and if your problem hasn’t been resolved, create a new service request by phone or by email.

## Viewing existing service requests
You can also view the status of all your existing service requests. To do so, you either click View service requests under the Support blade, or if you already have the help pane open, click the circular arrow icon in the Need help tab to display a list of your service requests.
