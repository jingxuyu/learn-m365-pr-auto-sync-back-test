To provide you with more examples of OKRs and the feedback that follows, we've provided five additional OKRs and the appropriate feedback and adjustments.  

Review these examples to familiarize yourself with the type of OKRs you’ll likely see and how to adjust them.

 NEW KEY RESULT: Increase the close rate of our EMEA sales team from 45% to 65% 

<br>
While the third key result is measurable, it doesn’t have specific targets.

 Potential leading indicators could be:
