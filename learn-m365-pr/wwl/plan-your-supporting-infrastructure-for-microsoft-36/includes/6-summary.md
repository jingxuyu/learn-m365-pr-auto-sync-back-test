This module examined the key areas that organizations must plan for to either move their Microsoft 365 service completely to the cloud or to hybridize their environment. The areas that you reviewed in this module included:

 -  email
 -  file storage and migration
 -  Microsoft Teams environment
 -  Active Directory integration

For email migrations from an existing on-premises Exchange Server environment, you can migrate all email, calendar, and contacts from user mailboxes to Microsoft 365. This module examined the migration options that are available depending on the number of mailboxes, the service you're migrating from, how quickly you want to migrate your email, who will manage your mail accounts, and your infrastructure requirements. These migration strategies include cutover migration, staged migration, hybrid migration, IMAP migration, and third-party migration.

You also learned that collaboration and file storage are supported in Microsoft 365 by using two key services: One Drive for Business and SharePoint Online. Using these services in collaboration can provide your company great opportunities to create a resilient and reliable file storage strategy.

This module also examined the network requirements that are required for supporting Microsoft Teams. Teams provides the backbone for enterprise voice and video in Microsoft 365. One of the key messages in this discussion is that when you plan your network infrastructure to support Microsoft Teams, you must have the required bandwidth, you must have access to all required IP addresses, the correct ports must be open, and you satisfy the performance requirements for real-time media.

This module concluded with an introduction to Azure Active Directory Connect. Microsoft 365 provides many ways to manage your user and group synchronization, all of which can be managed using Azure AD Connect. This application is a free feature provided by Microsoft to integrate your companyâ€™s Active Directory and import your local users to the cloud.
