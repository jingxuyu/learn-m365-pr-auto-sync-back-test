When a hardware component isn't working properly, one of the most common issues is an issue with the device driver. While Windows is capable of downloading and installing the correct driver in most situations, sometimes intervention is needed. Device Manager can be used to check the status of a driver, as well as rollback, update, and reinstall if necessary. Drivers should always be obtained from trusted sources, and 64-bit versions of the Windows client require the driver be signed. Staging drivers in the OS enables drivers to be available when needed, without the need for end user privileges to be elevated when the user connects the corresponding hardware. Group Policy can also be used to configure devices to only enable driver installation for approved hardware.
