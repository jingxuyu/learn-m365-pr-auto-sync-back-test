In this module, you'll learn about Microsoft 365 capabilities that can help you monitor and gain insight into your sensitive data landscape. 

The Microsoft 365 compliance center is a  starting point for understanding label usage across your organization. You can see the overall activity of sensitivity labeling during the past 30 days, the distribution of labels used, such as how many "Highly Confidential" labels were applied, and where labels were used, such as within Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or File Explorer. 

Because sensitive data can also reside on end-users' mobile devices, endpoints represent a key control point for your information protection strategy â€“ especially since devices are often the entry point for sophisticated attacks and data breaches. This module describes how Azure Information Protection analytics help give admins better visibility into sensitive information residing on managed devices.
