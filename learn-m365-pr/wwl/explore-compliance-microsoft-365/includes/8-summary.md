This module explored the tools Microsoft 365 has to help ensure an organization's regulatory compliance. Conforming to industry and governmental regulations is critical to the successful operation of any business. The focus of this module was on the Microsoft Purview compliance portal and formulating an organization's compliance score.

Organizations traditionally had their own networks, each of which was protected by a firewall. This design enabled them to protect the data, devices, and users within their networks. As technology has evolved, many organizations have implemented hybrid environments, with data being stored on-premises and in the cloud. Organizations are increasingly using cloud applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365 and Azure. They also have users external to their networks, using different devices to access that data. So the challenge for organizations today is to protect that information, and protect the devices and users that aren't connected to their networks.<br>

In this module, you examined how Microsoft 365 addresses these challenges to information protection and governance. Its approach provides comprehensive policies to protect and govern an organizations' most important data, throughout its life cycle. You learned that the center of compliance in Microsoft 365 is the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. And from a practical, day to day tracking of compliance status, organizations use the Compliance Manager dashboard.

This module examined how Compliance Manager helps simplify compliance and reduce risk by using:

 -  Pre-built assessments for common industry and regional standards and regulations.
 -  Custom assessments to meet your unique compliance needs.
 -  Workflow capabilities to help you efficiently complete your risk assessments through a single tool.
 -  Detailed step-by-step guidance on suggested improvement actions to help you comply with the standards and regulations that are most relevant for your organization.
 -  A risk-based compliance score to help you understand your compliance posture by measuring your progress in completing improvement actions.

This module also explored the purpose and function of the Microsoft compliance score. You learned how an organization's compliance score is determined, and how assessments are used to formulate scores.
