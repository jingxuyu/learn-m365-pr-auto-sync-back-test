A computer that is running Windows is more likely to face threats that originate from the network than from any other location. This is because attacks from the network can target a large number of computers and malicious users perform them remotely, whereas other forms of attacks require physical access to the computer. Windows client has a built-in security platform called Windows Security.

This platform provides comprehensive protection from most common security threats. Malware might show up on your organization’s computers and devices, despite your efforts to prevent it. When this occurs, you must investigate it immediately and take appropriate action. Windows includes components that can help you identify and remove malware from your environment’s computers. Windows Defender Firewall provides built-in functionality that you can use to protect Windows computers from unauthorized access attempts or other unwanted incoming or outgoing network traffic.
