### Security trends

The **Security trends** tile provides quick access to details about trending malware that has been caught in the Microsoft 365 network. Selecting any of the links in this tile opens an article with technical details about that specific malware family. These articles were published by the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) and security researchers around the world who partner with Microsoft to help prevent security incidents.

Where possible, these articles provide details about the malware family, including:

 -  How the exploit is delivered.
 -  How the payload is executed.
 -  Remediation steps.
 -  Security updates that are available.
