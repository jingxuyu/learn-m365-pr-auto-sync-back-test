You work for Woodgrove, a large financial organization. Your company's technical director shared a report about their internal IT infrastructure. The report reveals that, although your company's production environment runs on Windows 10, 20 percent of Windows 10 devices have reached, or are nearing, end of service. 

As a result, some devices that have critical business functions aren't receiving security updates, and are at greater risk of obtaining viruses and malware. Also, these devices might miss important feature updates to build on productivity across the organization. You've been asked to present a plan for how your company can stay current with the latest Windows updates from Microsoft.

In this module, youâ€™ll learn how you can use the Windows Servicing process to help your organization implement this updating plan.
