  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is correct about using Adaptive Cards in Microsoft Teams task modules?"
    choices:
    - content: "To use an Adaptive Card in a task module, set the task module info object to the Adaptive Card JSON when calling the `startTask()` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Adaptive Card should be specified on the `card` property on the task module info object. The info object also contains properties for the task module's title and size."
    - content: "To use an Adaptive Card in a task module, set the `card` property to the Adaptive Card JSON on the task module info object when calling the `startTask()` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Adaptive Cards can only be used to display information in task modules; they can't be used to collect and submit information from the user."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Adaptive Cards can submit data back to the registered handler in a task module. When the user submits an action from an Adaptive Card, all input values are added as properties to a single returned object."
  - content: "How does a tab get the value(s) from an Adaptive Card's submit action?"
    choices:
    - content: "All properties are returned in the `result` object of the callback defined in the `startTask()` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Adaptive cards include an additional property, `cardSubmission`, on the `result` object passed to the callback defined in the `startTask()` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct; a special property isn't created on the `result` for Adaptive Cards."
    - content: "Adaptive Cards submit responses to the endpoint specified on the `card` property on the `TaskModuleTaskInfo` object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct; Adaptive Cards include the values of all input controls in the `result` object of the configured callback."
