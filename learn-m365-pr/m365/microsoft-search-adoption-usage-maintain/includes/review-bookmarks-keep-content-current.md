Providing authoritative and accurate information in answers is critical to keeping users engaged with search. Search admins or editors should review suggested bookmarks regularly. 

## Review suggested bookmarks

Microsoft Search will evaluate SharePoint sites in your organization to identify high-traffic links and publish bookmarks for them. This evaluation is done on a 30-day cycle.  If you opt to add them to your suggested bookmarks list instead of automatically publishing them, we encourage you to review the suggestions every month.

## Keep seasonal content current

Answers that reference recurring events should be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. They might include information about:

- Annual meetings
- Benefit enrollment periods
- Holidays and holiday events
- Quarterly reports and deadlines

You can also use settings to publish or expire a bookmark or Q&A on a specific date.
