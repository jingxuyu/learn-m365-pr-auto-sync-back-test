The ever-growing threat landscape has been causing major vulnerabilities within organizations. The difficulty for administrators to manage new threats while maintaining a high-level threat posture can be a hard task for even the most seasoned security administrator. Maintaining this balancing act between new and existing security threats is especially challenging in organizations that maintain hybrid environments. Microsoft Defender for Identity helps address the security needs of these organizations. Defender for Identity protects your on-premises Active Directory users and the users that are synced to your Azure Active Directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Defender for Identity replaces Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA). For organizations that had previously implemented ATA, it's recommended that you transition to Microsoft Defender for Identity. While extended ATA support will last until January 2026, mainstream ATA support ended January 12, 2021. For information on transitioning from ATA to Microsoft Defender for Identity, see [Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) to Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/migrate-from-ata-overview?azure-portal=true).

In this module, you'll learn how Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics. The Microsoft Defender for identity portal is used to monitor and respond to detected suspicious activity. The portal provides a quick view of all suspicious activity in chronological order. It allows administrators to filter out specific details of any activity and gives actions based on those activities. The Defender for Identity portal also shows alerts and notifications that highlight problems detected by the service.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics.
 -  Describe how Defender for Identity protects user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory.
 -  Describe how Defender for Identity identifies and investigates suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain.
 -  Create your Microsoft Defender for Identity instance in the Defender for Identity portal.
 -  Use the built-in portal to monitor and respond to suspicious activity detected by Defender for Identity.
