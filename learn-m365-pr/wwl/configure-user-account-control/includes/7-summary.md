This module explained the User Account Control feature. The UAC feature protects against malicious or unauthorized administrative actions by elevated privileges on an as-needed basis. Users with standard permissions are able to perform day-to-day tasks. Administrative permissions are needed for less common actions, or actions that only system administrators should be performing. UAC provides the flexibility to allow users who perform administrative actions on their device to operate with reduced privileges. Alternatively, organizations can use UAC to restrict actions that increase risk and support costs.
