## Microsoft compliance center

The Microsoft 365 compliance center provides easy access to the data and tools you need to manage to your organization's compliance needs.  

The Microsoft 365 compliance center home page shows you, at a glance, how your organization is doing with data compliance, what solutions are available for your organization,  a summary of any active alerts, and more.

The default Microsoft compliance center view is likely to contain, but is not limited to, these cards:

- The **Microsoft Compliance Score** card, takes you to the new [Compliance Score](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/compliance-manager#understanding-your-compliance-score) solution. It calculates a risk-based score that measures your progress toward completing recommended actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards. It also provides workflow capabilities and built-in control mapping to help you efficiently carry out those actions.

A solution's capabilities and tools might include a combination of policies, alerts, reports, and more.

Microsoft compliance center is continually evolving with the addition of more functionality and solutions. In the meantime, there are a few tasks that must be completed in the Security & Compliance Center ([https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com/)). In those cases, you'll be directed automatically to the location where you can complete the task at hand.
