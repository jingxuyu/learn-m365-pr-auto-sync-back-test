    choices:
    - content: "Staged migration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This migration option doesn't provide the smoothest way to move mailboxes from the user perspective while requiring the greatest effort for messaging administrators. Try again."
    - content: "Minimal hybrid configuration / Express migration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This migration option doesn't provide the smoothest way to move mailboxes from the user perspective while requiring the greatest effort for messaging administrators. Try again."
    - content: "Coexistence"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. In a coexistence, you can move mailboxes between your on-premises mail servers and Exchange Online as your business allows, and without the users noticing a difference. As such, coexistence provides the smoothest way to move mailboxes from the user perspective, but it also requires the greatest effort for messaging administrators."
