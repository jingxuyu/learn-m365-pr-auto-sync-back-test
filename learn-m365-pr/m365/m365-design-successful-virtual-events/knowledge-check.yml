    choices:

    - content: "Accept everyone as a human first."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. People with disabilities aren't different, we are all human beings."
    - content: "Tailor your behavior for your audience."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Don't act differently around people who are different, just be yourself don't overreact."
  - content: "Why are Teams meetings and webinars more sensitive to network delays than live events that use encoders?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because the content for live events produced with encoders is streamed live, which is less likely to encounter network delays."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Live stream content is *more* likely to encounter network delays, not less likely."
    - content: "Because Teams meetings and webinars use Real-Time Protocol, which is sensitive to network delays."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Live events that are produced using encoders use RTMP, which is less sensitive."
    - content: "Because live events use eCDNs, which limit traffic across your company firewall."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While using an eCDN can help, what makes live events less vulnerable to network delays is using RTMP, instead of RTP."      
  - content: "How can you control who has access to live event features like transcriptions and recording?"
    choices:
    - content: "By using settings in Teams."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can use the settings to control who can schedule or join live events, and even whether a live event can be recorded."
    - content: "By using configuration settings for your Microsoft 365 tenant."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You use settings in Teams itself to control this behavior."
    - content: "By assigning different permissions to different groups."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You use settings in Teams itself to control this behavior."
