  - content: "Lucerne Publishing recently implemented Workplace Analytics. As Lucerne's Enterprise Administrator, you plan to use Privacy Settings to decide what data Lucerne wants to exclude from analysis and what data can be visible in the Workplace Analytics' queries. Which privacy setting should you configure to protect people from being identified in Workplace Analytics data?"

    - content: "Exclude terms from subject lines"

    - content: "Exclude domains or email addresses"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can exclude data from specific domains. You can also exclude data that includes specific email addresses. However, this setting doesn't protect people from being identified in Workplace Analytics data. Try again."
    - content: "Set the minimum group size"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The minimum group size rule protects people from being identified in Workplace Analytics data, including in Insights, Explore the stats, and Plans. If you change this setting, your change takes effect immediately."
