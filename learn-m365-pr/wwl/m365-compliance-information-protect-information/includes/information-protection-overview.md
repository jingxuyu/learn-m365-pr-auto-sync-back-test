With information protection and sensitivity labels, you can intelligently classify and help protect your sensitive content.

Sensitivity labels let you classify and protect your organization's data, while making sure users can be productive and collaborate effectively. A sensitivity label, when applied, can restrict access to content using encryption, add a mark to the document (like a watermark), or do nothing at all.

Sensitive information types help define how Microsoft 365 recognizes specific kinds of information, such as health service numbers and credit card numbers. Microsoft 365 includes many ready to use sensitive information types to use when creating sensitivity labels. Sensitive information types can also be used with the Azure Information Protection scanner to classify and protect files on-premises.

## Customer scenarios

Here are some common scenarios that Microsoft's solution for information protection can address:

- Classify content to generate usage reports for your sensitive content.
- Enforce encryption on any document labeled as confidential.

## Getting started with information protection

Sensitivity labels are used to classify and protect your content. The administrator creates each label and defines what it can do. The sensitivity label is published, via a sensitivity label policy, to the users and groups you want to use the label. Users classify emails and documents as they work on them. Microsoft 365 enforces the protection settings on the content based on the label applied. Sensitivity labels can also be automatically applied so users do not have to classify content themselves.

A way to get started with sensitivity labels is to classify content without using any protection settings. You can assign a classification to content like a stamp that persists and roams with the content as it's used and shared. You can use this classification to generate usage reports and see activity data for your sensitive content. You can choose to apply protection settings later once you confirm it is working as expected. Of course, you'll need to educate users on how to classify their content in whatever application they are using.

Consider publishing new sensitivity label policies to a small number of users first. You can incorporate the feedback you receive from the initial group, as you publish the policy more broadly.
