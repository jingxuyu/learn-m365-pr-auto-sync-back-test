Sometimes users work along departmental lines; other times they work in project groups made up from team members from other departments. Often, they work with people from outside their own organization, such as suppliers and customers. No matter how they work you must provide your users with the means to share their documents and data. This is known as collaboration. Itâ€™s also necessary to enable these users to discuss their work. This is known as communication.

Microsoft 365 provides a few different services that enable both collaboration and communication.
