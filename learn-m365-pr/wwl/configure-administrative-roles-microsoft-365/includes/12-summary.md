In this module, you examined how to configure Microsoft 365 admin roles. Your Microsoft 365 subscription comes with a set of admin roles that you can assign to users in your organization. Each admin role maps to common business functions and gives people in your organization permissions to do specific tasks in the admin centers.

This module provided a brief overview of the Microsoft 365 admin roles. It then did a deeper dive into the following roles that are more commonly used across organizations:

 *  Exchange Admin
 *  SharePoint Admin
 *  Modern Desktop Admin
 *  Security and Compliance Admin
 *  Teams Admin

This module then introduced you to Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). PIM enables you to manage, control, and monitor access within your organization. It helps your organization:

 *  See which users are assigned privileged roles to manage Azure resources, and which users are assigned administrative roles in Azure AD.
 *  Enable on-demand, "just in time" administrative access to Microsoft Online Services like Microsoft 365 and Intune, and to Azure resources of subscriptions, resource groups, and individual resources such as Virtual Machines.
 *  See a history of administrator activation, including what changes administrators made to Azure resources.
 *  Get alerts about changes in administrator assignments.
 *  Require approval to activate Azure AD privileged admin roles.
 *  Review membership of administrative roles and require users to provide a justification for continued membership.

The module concluded with a discussion of eligible admins. These users need privileged access periodically, but not all-day, every day. The role is inactive until the user needs access. At that point, the user must complete an activation process to become an active admin for a predetermined amount of time.
