5. Choose which users and groups will be assigned this profile.  You can broadly assign this profile to **Selected groups**, **All users**, **All devices**, and **All users and devices**.  Choosing **Selected groups** allows you to specify specific groups in your organization.  Additionally, you add a list of **excluded groups** as needed.
