This module introduced you to message encryption in Microsoft 365, and specifically, Office 365 Message Encryption (OME). OME is an intuitive service that enables email users to send encrypted messages to people inside and outside their organization. Selected recipients can easily view their encrypted messages and return encrypted replies. Regardless of the destination email service—whether it's Microsoft 365, Outlook.com, Yahoo, Gmail, or another service—email users can send confidential business communications with an added level of protection against unauthorized access.

This module began with an introduction to OME, including how Office 365 Message Encryption works. You learned that OME is an online service that's built on Microsoft Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS), which is part of Azure Information Protection. This service includes encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure your email. Messages can be encrypted using rights management templates.

You were then introduced to working with encrypted emails. While detailed guidance about how to send and view encrypted messages was outside the scope of this training, resource links were provided if you're interested in exploring the encryption process in more detail.

This module concluded with an examination of Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption. You were also be introduced to other encryption methods that can be used in Microsoft 365.
