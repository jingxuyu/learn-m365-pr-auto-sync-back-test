  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You want to enable your Chrome users to run a website with hardware-based isolation. You enable the rule in block mode but events indicate that Chrome is not using hardware-based isolation. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Instruct Chrome users to open the site in Microsoft Edge"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Hardware-based isolation is only supported for Microsoft Edge."
    - content: "Change the rule to run in audit mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In audit mode, rules are triggered and events are recorded but the rules are not enforced. This situation does not address the problem."
    - content: "Ensure that there is at least 5 GB of available disk space on the client computers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although hardware-based isolation requires 5 GB of available disk space, this issue is not addressed by that change."
  - content: "You want to ensure that users of Chrome, Edge, and a custom app that your company uses cannot access a specific custom domain on the internet. Which type of attack surface reduction rule should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Network protection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Network protection rules can prevent access to a network address, regardless of the client software that is used."
    - content: "Hardware-based isolation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Hardware-based isolation rules don't block access to a domain and can only be applied to Microsoft Edge or Microsoft Office applications."
    - content: "Web protection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Web protection can be applied to web browsers but not custom apps."
  - content: "When an attack surface reduction rule triggers, you want to record the event for later analysis but permit that action to continue without prompting the user. What mode should you configure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Block mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. In block mode, the action that triggered the rule is not permitted."
    - content: "Warn mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. In warn mode, the action is blocked although the user sees a prompt and can choose to continue with it."
    - content: "Audit mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In audit mode, the event is logged but the action is permitted to continue."
