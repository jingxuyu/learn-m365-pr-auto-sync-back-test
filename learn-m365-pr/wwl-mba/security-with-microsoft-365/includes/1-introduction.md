Organizations today spend incredible amounts of time, effort, and resources earning the public's trust-yet all of that hard-earned trust can be lost with a single data breach. Keeping up with cybersecurity threats can feel impossible as attacks become more sophisticated and frequent, and the amount of security information increases. Hackers increasingly attack organizations through apps and services outside of their boundaries. Most critically, they're going after employees' identities. The challenge is compounded by a dynamic and mobile workforce who take their devices-and the data they contain and access-with them wherever they go.

- Describe how Microsoft 365 security offerings work together to keep your data safe.
- Articulate the benefits of integrated security in Microsoft 365.
