Auditing is a vital part of security in many complex systems. Auditing records and displays who did what in your system. If a data breach or malicious attack occurs, audit logs enable you to diagnose what went wrong and take steps to prevent a recurrence.

## What is the audit log in Teams?

The audit log gives you visibility into users' activity within Microsoft Teams. You can understand how users are working with Teams and investigate any activities that might indicate a security issue.

## Enable auditing in Teams

To use audit data, you first enable auditing in the Security & Compliance Center. Audit data is available only from the point at which you turn on auditing.

## Search the audit log

The audit log allows you to understand a range of activities across Microsoft 365 services. For Microsoft Teams, more than 20 different activities are audited, including:

- Team creation
- Team deletion
- Added channel
- Changed setting

For a complete list of Teams activities that are stored in the audit log, see the link below.

## Shifts in Teams activities

If you're using the Shifts app in Teams, you can also search the audit log for activities related to that app. See the link below for a list of all the activities that are included in the Microsoft 365 audit log. This feature is currently in preview.
