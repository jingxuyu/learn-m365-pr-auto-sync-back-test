Organizations should plan for hardware failures, and it's important to take precautions. While failures with hardware that contain moving parts tend to be more frequent - hard drives, optical drives, and hardware with fans (such as power supplies) - any component can fail. Components are more likely to fail to environmental issues such as heat, moisture, dust, and electrical (static, surges) anomalies. Properly ventilation, cleaning, and devices like surge suppressors can reduce the risk significantly. For issues that are more difficult to diagnose, such as memory issues, use the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool. For critical devices, consider redundancy such as mirroring drives in the event of disk failure.
