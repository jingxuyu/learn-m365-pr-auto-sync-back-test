  - content: "At Tailspin Toys, the members of the Sales team have different audio and video policy settings. Holly Dickson has a meeting policy that doesn't restrict video. Patti Fernandez and Allan Deyoung have user policies that restrict accessing video in meetings. When Holly organizes a meeting, how will this affect Patti and Allan in the meeting?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allan and Patti will have access to video in the meeting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This scenario won't be the result of Holly, Allan, and Patti's meeting policies."
    - content: "Allan and Patti won't have access to video in the meeting"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The most restrictive policy between the meeting organizer’s policy and the user’s policy applies. Since Allan and Patti's meeting policies are more restrictive than Holly's, Allan and Patti won't have access to video in the meeting that Holly organizes."
    - content: "All attendees to the meeting, including Allan and Patti, will have access to video"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This scenario won't be the result of Holly, Allan, and Patti's meeting policies."
  - content: "As the Teams administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is configuring the company's audio conferencing settings. What rule controls how many Audio Conferencing licenses that Holly must obtain?"
    choices:
    - content: "Holly will need a license for each person who plans to schedule or lead meetings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Audio Conferencing must be set up for people who plan to schedule or lead host meetings. One Audio Conferencing license is required for each person who is going to schedule/host an audio meeting. Meeting attendees who call in don't need a license assigned to them or any other setup."
    - content: "Holly will need a license for every user who attends a meeting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the rule that controls how many Audio Conferencing licenses Holly must obtain."
    - content: "Holly will need a license for every Microsoft 365 user account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the rule that controls how many Audio Conferencing licenses Holly must obtain."
  - content: "As the Teams administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is configuring the company's Live events. Once Holly creates a Live events policy, what must she do for the policy to become active?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set the policy's status to Enabled"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't what Holly must do to make the policy active."
    - content: "Assign the policy to one or more users"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Once a custom Live events policy is created, it must be assigned to users in order for the policy to become active."
    - content: "Holly doesn't have to do anything; the Live events policy will be active as soon as Holly creates it"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't what Holly must do to make the policy active."
  - content: "As the Project Manager for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to create a regular meeting where the entire project team is invited. This meeting will enable the team members to coordinate tasks and keep up to date with current team activity. What type of meeting should Holly create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ad-hoc meeting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An ad-hoc meeting is a 'spur of the moment' type of meeting that addresses some pressing need. It isn't a regularly scheduled meeting with a set agenda, such as coordinating tasks and keeping up to date."
    - content: "Channel meeting"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If a team has a dedicated channel in Microsoft Teams, it can schedule a channel meeting. All team members can see and join the meeting. Channel meetings typically have set agendas; they're not a spur of the moment, ad-hoc meeting. While an ad-hoc meeting can originate from a channel meeting, a channel meeting isn't the equivalent of an ad-hoc meeting."
    - content: "Private meeting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Private meetings involve non-team members."
  - content: "As the Teams administrator for Tailspin Toys, Allan DeYoung, a business manager wants to prevent anonymous users who got access to the meeting link from joining Teams meetings. How can Allan achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure Meetings policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't how Allan will achieve this goal of preventing anonymous users from joining Teams meetings. Try again."
    - content: "Configure Live Events settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't how Allan will achieve this goal of preventing anonymous users from joining Teams meetings. Try again."
    - content: "Configure Meetings settings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Anonymous participants are users who can join a meeting without logging in, as long as they have the link for the meeting. Using the Meeting settings, the Teams administrator can define whether anonymous participants can join a meeting."

    - content: "Live event in Stream"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Live events in Stream enable companies to deliver internal live or on-demand video for learning, training, or other specialized issues. Live broadcasts can be viewed in Stream or embedded on custom intranet pages or other hosting spots, and when the event ends employees can find them there for later use.
