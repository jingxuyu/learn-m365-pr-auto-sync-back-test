## What makes up a Microsoft Teams app?

Apps built on the Microsoft Teams Platform consist of three primary pieces.

### The Microsoft Teams client

The Microsoft Teams clients (mobile, web, and desktop) provide the extensibility points and UI elements your app can take advantage of. When a user installs your app it will be available across all three clients be default, so you'll need to consider how your app will function on each. You'll want to make sure you test your app on mobile devices, particularly if you have any embedded web experiences, or if your app requires user authentication.

### Your app package

Your app package is what actually gets installed to Microsoft Teams.

## How can I distribute my app?

You have three options for distributing your custom Microsoft Teams app, depending on your target audience. 

* **Upload your app for an individual or team.** blah
* **Publish your app to your organizational app catalog.** blah
* **Publish your app to the public App Store.** blah

When distributing your app you need to take into consideration not just your desired audience, but the IT policies in place in the organization you want to share your app with. Each organization has complete control over determining which publishing options are available, and which apps are available in the app store.
