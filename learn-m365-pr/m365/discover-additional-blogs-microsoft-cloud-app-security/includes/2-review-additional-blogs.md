It’s important for any security administrator to be able to keep up to date with the technologies they work with. If you’re using Microsoft Cloud App Security, you’ll want to learn more about new and existing features. Microsoft and the Cloud App Security team have curated content relating to cloud app technologies, and presented this material in a series of blogs and websites. 

## Cloud App Security Broker (CASB) ninja blog series

The CASB Ninja Blog Series contains articles that will help to arm you with the skills and knowledge you need to be successful with a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB). Ultimately, perhaps, giving you the skills to be a CASB ninja within your organization.

The authors will share their knowledge and experience on real-world scenarios, and how Cloud App Security can help address issues within those scenarios. You’ll dive deep into use cases, architecture design, implementation and configuration best practices, operations, and more.

In the blogs, you’ll learn how you can use Cloud App Security in the following five topic areas:

- Shadow IT Discovery & Control
- Information Protection
- Threat Protection
- Real-time Access Management
- Cloud Security Posture Management

The blog is located just off the Microsoft Security and Compliance website. You can review the content here: [Welcome to the MCAS Ninja Blog Series!]( https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/welcome-to-the-mcas-ninja-blog-series/ba-p/1775379?azure-portal=true).

## MCAS data protection blog series

This blog is written by Sarahzin Chowdhury. She’s one of the Cloud App Security and Defender for Identity Program Managers on the Cloud + AI Security Customer Experience Engineering team. Throughout this series, she’ll be explaining how to protect your data using Microsoft Cloud App Security.

Sarahzin aims to cover some of the top use cases and top customer questions using:

- Real-time (Conditional Access App Control)
- Real-time (API-based App Connectors) Cloud App Security mechanisms

Data protection is a key pillar in Cloud App Security, and throughout Cloud App Security, you can implement data protection in many areas:

- Use the data classification service or the built-in service to scan all the files in Office 365 and third party connected apps.
- Implement data loss prevention (DLP) using the Cloud App Security Proxy.
- Implement Azure Information Protection (AIP) with Cloud App Security.

This blog series’ initial focus will be discussing the end user’s experience with each of the connected apps.

## Securing administrative access to Microsoft Cloud App Security and Defender for Identities

Security administrators often focus on best practices for securing their organization’s users, apps, services, and devices. But it’s easy to forget that Security Administrators are also users. And it’s at least, if not more, important to secure these administrative accounts within your organization.

This blog seeks to highlight this issue, and to identify best practices to help ensure your administrative accounts are properly secured. In the article, the author discusses multi-factor authentication and default Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) roles.

## Limiting inherited roles from Azure Active Directory in Microsoft Cloud App Security

In this article, the authors discuss how to restrict accesses in line with your organization’s security best practices and observe the principle of least privilege. Access to Cloud App Security is granted through inherited roles from Azure AD or through Azure role-based access control (RBAC) assignments from within the Cloud App Security portal itself.

The article seeks to answer the question:

*“We have a defined Azure RBAC policy. We have assigned Security administrators to specific groups. These groups have access across our entire security stack. But we want to follow least privilege and grant access only to specific products with the permissions inherited from the Security administrator role. Given that not all the products have a product-specific administrator role available in Azure AD, how can we limit the Security administrator role’s access in Cloud App Security without impacting existing permissions to other products?”*
