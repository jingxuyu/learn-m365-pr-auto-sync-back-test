This module examined the compliance features available in the Exchange admin center for Exchange Server and Exchange hybrid deployments.

Compliance settings in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal only apply to messages stored in Exchange Online that are routed through Exchange Online and Exchange Online Protection. These settings aren't applied to messages in on-premises Exchange Servers. If you're running a hybrid environment and you're still routing your mail flow over your on-premises servers, or if you still maintain mailboxes outside of Exchange Online, you must combine the compliance features from the on-premises Exchange admin center with the modern compliance features from the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

The module began by examining the differences between in-place and litigation hold. Organizations apply holds to preserve electronically stored information, including email that's relevant to litigation cases. You then explored how Messaging Records Management (MRM) helps organizations manage the email lifecycle and reduce legal risks associated with email and other communications.

The module concluded with an analysis of message tracking. You learned how to use message tracking for message forensics, mail flow analysis, reporting, and troubleshooting.
