This module examined the authentication and provisioning options available in Microsoft 365. These options control how identities are later synchronized between on-premises Active Directory and Microsoft 365.

In this module, you learned that if you have an existing on-premises directory, such as Active Directory, you can integrate it with Azure Active Directory. This integration is done by synchronizing your identities from the on-premises directory to Microsoft 365. You also learned about basic directory synchronization concepts, and how identity synchronization is accomplished using Azure AD Connect.

This module focused on Azure AD Connect, which is Microsoft's officially recommended tool for synchronizing on-premises identities and objects with Azure AD. You learned how Azure AD Connect enables coexistence between your on-premises Active Directory environment and Microsoft 365.
