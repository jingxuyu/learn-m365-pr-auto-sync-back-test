The last strategy for ensuring program success is to make the change visible to your team. Making change visible not only keeps OKRs top of mind for new users, but it also increases familiarity with a new product. Personal trainers have found that the key to installing a new behavior is consistent exposure. People begin making change by observing the behavior of others and being exposed to it environmentally. For example, if you want to make it more likely to go the gym in the morning, lay out all your gym clothes next to your bed the night before. Make it visible.

While there are many strategies for making a new change visible, here are three strategies for OKRs that are helpful: example-based leadership, using reminders, and habit-stacking.

## Example-based leadership

OKR Champions should lead by example, demonstrating how to emerge in daily work rhythms. Rather than simply talking about how the company is doing in town hall meetings, OKR Champions can reinforce OKRs by contextualizing it with OKR progress.

In team and one-on-one meetings, OKR Champions should use dashboards to keep agendas and check in on OKR progress. This keeps everyone regularly exposed to the Viva Goals, sets the expectation that they'll be regularly using it, and increases familiarity on how it can be used.

## Using reminders

While it may seem an obvious strategy, it's one worth mentioning! Use reminders to build muscle memory and drive repetitive behavior. Once something is committed to muscle memory, it doesn't take up the same mental bandwidth or effort to sustain the new behavior. You can help yourself build this by setting a nudge to remind you and your team to update your OKRs at the same time each week.

## Habit-Stacking

Habit-stacking is a strategy for implementing new behavior that groups together small activities and links them to an established habit. If someone wanted to start drinking more water, for example, and they already had a morning routine of drinking coffee, they could stack a new habit of drinking one glass of water while they make their coffee.

This strategy works well for building OKR rhythms. If you already have a weekly team meeting, stack a new habit of performing a check-in on your OKR before the meeting. Soon you'll associate the new habit of, "when I get the meeting alert, I'll do my check-in so I'm prepared for the meeting." OKR Champions should share this tip with their teammates and make it clear that OKRs will be a regular part of meetings.

These three strategies for making the change to OKRs visible can have significant impacts on the long-term success of an OKR program. OKR Champions should strategize at the beginning on how to incorporate these strategies into their daily work rhythms.
