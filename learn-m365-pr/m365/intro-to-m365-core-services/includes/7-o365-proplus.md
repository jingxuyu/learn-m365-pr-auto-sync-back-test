Office 365 ProPlus includes the Microsoft productivity suite of applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, for both Windows and Mac devices. Office 365 ProPlus isn't a web-based version of Office - instead it's a full version of Office that your users install and run on their devices. You can use the Office applications that come with Office 365 ProPlus with the on-premises or online versions of Exchange, SharePoint, or Skype for Business.

You can install Office 365 ProPlus from a network share or directly from the internet. After it's installed, you don’t have to be connected to the internet to use Office 365 ProPlus. However, you'll need to connect at least once every 30 days to ensure your license is still active.

Office 365 ProPlus is updated either monthly or semi-annually with new features, security updates, and other quality updates from Microsoft. You can choose which frequency works best for your organization by using update channels.
