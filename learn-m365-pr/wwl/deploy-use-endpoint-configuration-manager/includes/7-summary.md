Configuration Manager is the on-premises tool commonly used by many organizations to manage their end-to-end desktop lifecycle. Configuration Manager has evolved and is now part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager. This integration with Endpoint Manager admin center allows customers to continue using Configuration Manager, while leveraging the unique capabilities of cloud solutions such as Microsoft Intune and Azure AD. Configuration Manager and the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) share many of the same deployment capabilities, such as Task Sequences. Unlike MDT, Configuration Manager also provides the day-to-day management capabilities such as managing app and OS updates, inventory, reporting.
