This unit provides a list of Cloud Discovery errors and resolution recommendations for each.

### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration

Organizations often integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. When an organization integrates these two Microsoft 365 Defender services and it doesn't see the results of the integration, it should refer to the following table. This table provides resolution actions to be taken for each error that can occur.

### Log parsing errors

You can track the processing of Cloud Discovery logs using the governance log. The following table provides resolution actions to be taken for each error that can occur.

| Logs sent to the collector don't appear in the portal. | Complete the following steps:<br><br>1. Check to see if there are failed parsing tasks in the Governance log.<br>\- If so, troubleshoot the error with the Log Parsing error table above.<br>\- If not, complete the following steps to check the data sources and Log collector configuration in the portal:<br>a. In the **Data source** page, verify that the name of data source is **NSS** and that it's configured correctly.<br>b. In the **Log collectors** page, verify that the data source is linked to the right log collector.<br><br>2. Check the local configuration of the on-premises log collector machine by completing the following steps:<br>a. Sign-in to the log collector over SSH and run the **collector\_config** utility.<br>b. Confirm that your firewall or proxy is sending logs to the log collector using the protocol you defined (Syslog/TCP, Syslog/UDP or FTP). Then verify that it's sending them to the correct port and directory.<br>c. Run netstat on the machine and verify that it receives incoming connections from your firewall or proxy.<br><br>3.
