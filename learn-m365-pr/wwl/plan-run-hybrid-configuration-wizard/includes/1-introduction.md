Planning a hybrid configuration is crucial to preventing issues during deployment. One of the key components in a hybrid configuration is the Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW).

This module examines all planning aspects that are required before running the HCW. Critical areas of concern include the configuration options of the HCW, and the details on Organization Configuration Transfer (OCT) and the Hybrid Agent.

You'll then review the mail flow options for a hybrid deployment. Most organizations configure their hybrid deployment to share a common SMTP email namespace. This design requires routing messages in between your on-premises Exchange Servers and Exchange Online. As such, the module will examine how to organize the email flow to and from the Internet, and between Exchange Online and the Exchange Server on-premises organization.

Configuring a hybrid deployment is the first step for any Exchange organization. This step is completed whether you want to connect your Exchange on-premises and Exchange Online organizations for long-term coexistence, or as part of a cloud migration strategy.

In this module, you'll learn about the requirements and best practices to configure a hybrid deployment. To support this scenario, this module explores the requirements and best practices to configure a hybrid deployment.
