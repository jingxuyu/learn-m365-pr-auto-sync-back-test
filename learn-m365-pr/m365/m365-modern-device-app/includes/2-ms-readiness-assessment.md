### Checking readiness with Windows 10 compatibility scan

Before deploying Windows 10 Microsoft strongly recommends checking the readiness of your existing devices running Windows 7 or 8/8.1. Windows 10 installation media supports a command line switch **ScanOnly** to check for compatibility. ScanOnly can be run as a scripted batch file or integrated into a System Center Configuration Manager task sequence, including the ability to run the ScanOnly directly from the network so the Windows 10 installation media isn’t streamed down to the local device. When ScanOnly completes the results are returned via return codes in log files generated by setup.exe.

A sample ScanOnly command line that completes the compatibility scan silently would look like this:

```
Setup.EXE /Auto Upgrade /Quiet /NoReboot /Compat ScanOnly
```
### Using Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness

Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness is our recommended tool for assessing your organization’s readiness. It guides you through any necessary preparation tasks, making use of application and driver compatibility information gathered through the upgrade of hundreds of millions of consumer PCs. This information gives you a detailed assessment, identifies compatibility issues that might block your upgrade, and is supported with links to suggested fixes known to Microsoft.

To set up Window Analytics Upgrade Readiness you’ll first need to set up an Azure subscription, including an Azure Log Analytics workspace. Once Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness is running, you can then enroll any Internet-connected Windows 7 SP1 or newer device via Group Policy settings to start collecting diagnostic data. There are no agents to deploy, and Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness’s visual workflow guides you from pilot to production deployment. If you wish, you can export data from Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness to software deployment tools such as System Center Configuration Manager to target PCs directly and build device collections as they become ready for deployment.


### Using the Readiness Toolkit for Office

The Readiness Toolkit for Office add-ins and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA} can help you identify compatibility issues with your VBA macros and add-ins that you use with Office. The Readiness Toolkit includes the Readiness Report Creator, which creates an Excel report with VBA macro compatibility and add-in readiness information. The Readiness Report Creator can scan for VBA macros in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, Project, Visio, and Publisher files for Office versions as far back as Office 2003. It can also scan for certain types of add-ins used with Office. However it doesn't include web add-ins.
 
The Readiness Toolkit for Office is free from the Microsoft Download Center and checks if you're using the most current version when you run a report. If a newer version exists it will prompt you to download the most current version, and you don't have to uninstall the older version. The download is an MSI file that after installation allows you to run the Readiness Report Creator on a device by completing a UI wizard.  For organizational usage there is also a standalone executable that can be run from the command line or used with scripts. This is useful to collect readiness information from users throughout your organization in a more wide-scale and automated manner.
