The Microsoft 365 Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator roles contain permissions for managing all aspects of the Security and Compliance product. In collaboration with the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator, the Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator roles manage several different services in the Security center and Compliance Center, respectively, and by remote access using PowerShell.

Some of the key responsibilities assigned to the Microsoft 365 Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator roles are identified in the following table.

Device management

Just like with archiving, the Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator can manage mobile devices through security policies that grant access to their work email, calendar, contacts, and documents at any time. While the Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator can also create policies to wipe devices that are lost or stolen, this responsibility is typically managed by the Modern Desktop Administrator.

Permissions


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

The Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator can set special permissions inside the Compliance Center. For example, assume the Exchange Administrator must run an eDiscovery for missing mail. Inherently, the Exchange Administrator wouldn't have access to this action unless the Security Administrator or Compliance Administrator grants this access to the Exchange Administrator role.

Retention


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

The Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator, with help from the Enterprise Administrator, can create and manage retention policies and tags. The Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator can then use these policies to store content and manage how long the organization keeps that content.

Auditing and investigation


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

The Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator are responsible for creating alerts and monitoring specific actions, all by using the Audit log search feature. This feature requires some extra steps to manage auditing and investigation across the entire tenant. Once these steps are complete, the Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator can monitor key events and identify malignant actions that occur in the tenant.

The following graphic shows that the Security Administrator and Compliance Administrator roles are both included in the Global Admin role, while the eDiscovery Administrator role isn't included. In fact, the eDiscovery admin role isn't assigned to any admin role by default, not even the Global Admin role.
