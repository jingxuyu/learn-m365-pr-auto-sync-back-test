This module introduced you to the features and functionality of Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP). You learned that EOP is a cloud-based email filtering service. It provides anti-malware and anti-spam policies to protect organizations against spam and malware. EOP includes features to safeguard organizations from messaging policy violations.

This module also examined the primary ways in which EOP can be used for messaging protection. You learned that when you register for Exchange Online or Microsoft 365, EOP is automatically applied to any message that's received or sent from your online tenant. No extra configuration is needed. If you configure a hybrid deployment using the Hybrid Configuration Wizard, any mail that's sent between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online is subject to inspection by EOP.

You also learned that EOP functionality can optionally be extended by using another service called Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (formerly Advanced Threat Protection, or ATP). Microsoft Defender includes an email filtering service that provides extra protection against specific types of advanced threats.

The module analyzed the three different ways of deploying EOP:<br>

 -  EOP with Exchange Online mailboxes
 -  EOP with on-premises mailboxes (also known as EOP standalone)
 -  EOP with Exchange Hybrid Deployment

You then learned how to configure mail flow using EOP in each of these deployment scenarios. The module concluded by introducing you to the types of reports that are available to help you determine the overall status and health of your organization.
