Let's learn some of the top benefits of cloud computing.

## It’s cost-effective 
Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model. Rather than paying for a pre-defined amount of computing resources or hardware up-front, you rent hardware and pay for the resources that you use. 
The cloud service provider is responsible for the cost overhead. Because they do it at scale, it’s much more cost effective. 

## It’s scalable 
You can increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time. Cloud computing supports both vertical and horizontal scaling depending on 
your needs.

Vertical scaling, also known as "scaling up", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. When you “scale up,” you might be adding a faster CPU, additional CPUs, or more memory.

Horizontal scaling, also known as "scaling out," is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. If your company hires more employees and handles more data, you are “scaling out.”

Scaling in the cloud can be done manually or automatically based on specific triggers (like CPU utilization or the number of requests), and resources can be allocated or deallocated in minutes. 

## It’s elastic 
As your workload changes due to a spike or drop in demand, a cloud computing system can compensate by automatically adding or removing resources. 

For example, the cloud can automatically scale resources for the core hours that the most employees are using an application and remove those resources at the end of the day.


## It’s always up to date 
When you use the cloud, you’re able to focus on what matters: your organization. You don't have to be caught up in the maintenance work of software patching, hardware setup, upgrades, and other IT management tasks. All of this is automatically done for you to ensure you're using the latest and greatest tools to run your organization.

Additionally, the hardware that runs the resources you use is maintained and upgraded by the cloud provider. For example, if a disk fails, it is  replaced. If new hardware comes out, you don’t have to go through the process of replacing your hardware. You also don’t have to bear the cost of updating your software all the time.

## It’s reliable 
When you're running an organization, you want to be confident your data is always going to be there. It can be devastating to lose important files. Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data replication services to make sure your data is always safe. In addition, redundancy is often built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This is called fault tolerance and it ensures that your cloud services aren't impacted if a hardware failure or other incident occurs.

## It’s global 
Cloud providers maintain a global presence. That means your users can get to the cloud services they need wherever they are, and your customers benefit from a local presence for your organization that is close to them. It also ensures you meet regional data-residency and compliance laws for your customers. For your employees, they can be mobile and access your organization’s software and data without using a virtual private network (VPN) solution. 

## It’s secure 
Think about how you secure your datacenter. You have physical security – who can access your building - and digital security – who can connect to your systems and data over the network.
Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technicians that can provide better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve. As a result, security is stronger, which helps to protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

When it comes to physical security – threats to cloud infrastructure, cloud providers invest heavily in buildings, cameras, gates, security personnel, and so on to protect their physical assets. They also have strict procedures in place to ensure employees have access only to those resources that they’ve been authorized to manage.

Digital security is even more important because of the unique features of the cloud. You’re renting compute and storage resources from a shared pool and data can travel in a variety of ways, including over the Internet and between datacenters.

You’d want only authorized users to be able to log into services, virtual machines, and storage systems running in the cloud. The responsibility for securing these resources is shared between you and the cloud provider. Cloud providers offer tools that help protect you against security threats, but you must use these tools to protect the resources you use.
