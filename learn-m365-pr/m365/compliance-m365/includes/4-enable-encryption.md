Microsoft uses some of the strongest encryption protocols and follows stringent industry standards for use of encryption â€“ data encrypted by default, at rest and in transit. For data at rest, data is encrypted at physical disk layer with BitLocker and at the application layer with service encryption. For data in transit data is encrypted as it moves across the network with TLS (Transport Layer Security). 

For additional controls, customers can encrypt their data in transit, and more granularly at content level, with Office 365 Message Encryption and Azure Information Protection, which can provide an added layer protection on top of TLS. 

Lastly for customers with specific compliance obligations that require them to provide and control their own encryption keys, we provide several options here as well with features like Customer Key or Bring Your Own Key, Hold Your Own Key with Azure Information Protection.
