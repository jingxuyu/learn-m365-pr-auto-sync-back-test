Governing your data is about keeping what you need and deleting what you donâ€™t, to meet compliance requirements and reduce your overall risk landscape. Microsoft's solutions for governing your data are Information governance and Records management. 

**Information governance** manages your content lifecycle using solutions to import, store, and classify business-critical data so you can keep what you need and delete what you do not.

Records management uses intelligent classification to automate and simplify the retention schedule for regulatory, legal, and business-critical records in your organization. It is for that special set of content which needs to be immutable (cannot be changed).

**Information governance** and **Records management** are covered in more depth in other modules in this learning path, but here are some key themes of the Microsoft solutions for governing your data.

### Streamlined administration
Centralized policy administration allows you to incorporate data inside and outside Microsoft 365 to be managed by the same set of policies. You can create one policy and have it apply across multiple services.

### Automation at scale
Governance policies can be configured to work automatically and applied organization-wide, if desired. For example, the system can be configured to delete obsolete or irrelevant data without user intervention, reducing the amount of data to govern.

### Tailored workflows
Retention policies are flexible including the capability to create custom events, such as the departure of an employee, to trigger the retention process. Disposition review lets you name specific people, per label, to review and determine what should be done for each item reaching the end of its retention period.
