People need to communicate with each other to get their work done. It's hard to match face-to-face meetings, but when your team is distributed globally virtual events are the solution. Microsoft 365 includes Microsoft Teams support many different approaches to hosting virtual events.

As part of the group organizing your virtual summit, you know your project wants to have different kinds of events. You're going to research Microsoft 365 and check it has the tools to support the range of events you're going to produce.

Here you'll define what virtual events mean to your organization, look at the different scenario's, what roles make an event a success, and finally how you can bring these different kinds of interactions together in a combined virtual summit.

## Microsoft Teams meeting vs. Webinar vs. Live Events

Microsoft 365 can scale from the smallest one-to-one video call, to a large-scale public broadcast with one to many thousands of attendees. For example, you can easily meet everyone in your team virtually by selecting **Join Online** from a calendar reminder.

Compare meetings to webinars that can be a combination of live, or pre-recorded content, delivered to communities or at conferences. The best webinars involve two-way engagement so the chat, screen sharing, and video sharing tools built into Microsoft Teams make it a great fit for webinars.

To scale up the production of a virtual event to the level of broadcasting to thousands of attendees, Microsoft Teams lets you create **Live Events**. With Live Events Microsoft give you more control of production and how your content and the presenters are shown to attendees. Live events support can be found in Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and Microsoft Stream. You can choose the right tool for the size and complexity of your event scenario.

## Event scenarios

A diagram that has five columns. The first shows complexity with simple at the top and an arrow pointing to down to complex. The second column is titled event scenario and lists Team meetings, webinars, virtual conferences, leadership townhall, and public broadcasts. The third column is production level, and lists webcams, could be custom production, and custom production only. The fourth column is attendees with the top value up to 10,000 and the bottom value up to 100,000. The last column is solution, and it lists Live event in Teams, then Live event in Yammer, and the lowest item is Live event in Stream.

The different kinds of virtual event support in Microsoft 365 ranges in complexity from the simplest small team meetings using Microsoft Teams, to international public broadcasts to hundreds of thousands of attendees with Live events and Microsoft Stream.

Webinars are the next step up in complexity from team meetings, and can be stand alone or form part of a series. You might consider using them to funnel attendance to larger conferences or community events. Great webinars are interactive and include hands on learning with presentations possibly being a combination of pre-recorded and live video.

Virtual conferences will tend to be larger and longer than webinars, with multi-track and varying content types. It's a good idea to have moderators involved with the event to monitor and manage question and answer sessions.

Leadership townhalls change the interaction from two-way engagement to single presenters and large audiences. Q & A can be moderated along with the presentations, with the aim to deliver quality messages to large teams or departments.

The most complex scenario is a professional public broadcast. It will likely involve presenters recorded live in a studio. The production will be optimized for viewers to stream the event onto a wide range of platforms. Your keynote speakers will most likely present at your summit using one of the Live Event options.

## Key roles to make your event a success

The kind of virtual events you're producing will dictate the number and types of roles you need to fill.

## Combination events

Having read about all the different event scenarios you'll see that in most cases events will use a combination of all the above. For your summit, you'll want to have small breakout sessions that support different content tracks. Attendees will likely use Microsoft Teams to participate. The moderators will encourage two-way conversations, with attendees able to share their own content and videos.

Your key note speakers will use a heavily customized production, using a broadcast quality video studio, with highly moderated chat and Q & A sections. The content will be recorded and then made available to stream later offline by all attendees.
