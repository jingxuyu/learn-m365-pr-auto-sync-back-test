In Microsoft Teams, you can connect with other users and have conference calls and video conferences over an internet connection. If you want to go further, you can also use Teams Phone System Direct Routing to integrate with your telephony carrier and receive or make calls to public switched telephone networks (PSTNs). By integrating Teams with telephony systems, your users get one client for all voice communications.

Suppose you're the lead administrator for Teams at a clothing retailer. You support over 3,000 users and a hardware-based voice over IP system for all telephony on-premises. You've recently rolled out Microsoft Teams and your organization is using it for collaboration and video conferencing. You've been asked to investigate how Direct Routing could replace your organization's existing phone system.

In this module, you'll learn about the advantages of the Teams PSTN integration, so that you can decide whether it's appropriate for your organization.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Assess if Direct Routing is the right choice for your organization.
- Describe the benefits of Direct Routing.
- Explain what issues to consider when you plan Direct Routing.
