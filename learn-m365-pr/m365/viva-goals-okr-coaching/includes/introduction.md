Creating OKRs can be a challenge for anyone, and when moving an entire organization over to OKRs, that challenge is multiplied tenfold. OKR Coaches are a great resource to use when helping people craft OKRs.   

OKR coaches can be both internal to your company and external resources that you bring in to assist.  This program is specifically meant to focus on the development of internal OKR coaches for your organization.  

Imagine you work for a company that has started their OKR journey with Viva Goals.  Your team has had great success in learning how to use and write OKRs already, but other teams are struggling. They need someone to guide them through the OKR creation process and effectively facilitate discussion.  OKR coaches help to play that facilitation role, guide discussion, and get teams moving along in their OKR development. 

By the end of this module, you'll be able to define the role of an OKR coach, name and describe the three key questions that an OKR coach asks, and apply unblocking tactics to encourage effective group discussion.
