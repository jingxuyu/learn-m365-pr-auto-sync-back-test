    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Your finance department wants to start processing invoices more efficiently. Why would form processing models be the best solution for this type of content understanding, as opposed to document understanding models?"
      choices:
      - content: "Invoices are a structured document that contains defined fields and a similar structure between all forms."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Form processing is ideal for structured or semi-structured documents, whereas document understanding is for unstructured documents, such as letters or contracts."
      - content: "Invoices contain information that AI can easily extract and document understanding models do not use AI Builder."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. While form processing models do use AI Builder, document understanding models built in the content center also use AI for processing, so this logic does not accurately explain why you wouldn’t use a document understanding model."
      - content: "Invoices are less structured and are not uniform enough to be used by a form processing model."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Invoices are structured documents with defined fields and sections, as opposed to being a block of text that would be processed with document understanding models."

    - content: "Before using Syntex more widely in your organization, the leadership team wants to establish best practices and guidelines for use. Which Syntex role would this responsibility fall under?"
      choices:
      - content: "SharePoint/Knowledge admin"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The SharePoint/Knowledge admin is responsible for creating content centers and applying AI Builder to the appropriate document libraries, as well as assigning permissions."
      - content: "Power Platform admin"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The Power Platform admin is responsible for configuring the data service environment for form processing, as well as purchasing and allocating audio index blob (AIB) credits."
      - content: "Knowledge manager"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The knowledge manager establishes best practices and guidelines for using Syntex, as well as pinpointing and aggregating the specific use cases for content understanding that apply to your organization’s needs and pain points."

    - content: "Which stakeholder manages the entire execution and launch of the new content understanding system?"
      choices:
      - content: "Power Platform admin"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. As a stakeholder, the Power Platform is a technical stakeholder who manages the use of Power Apps and AI Builder."
      - content: " Knowledge admin"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The knowledge admin is particularly interested in the establishment and success of content centers that they create for your document understanding models."
      - content: "Project lead"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Project leads manage the execution and launch of Syntex, including ensuring that all the other stakeholders are identified, and roles and responsibilities are clearly defined."

    - content: "What is the definition of a business driver?"
      choices:
      - content: "The key numbers that will help define how the change is measured."

        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Business drivers are both the challenges and opportunities that motivate the change."
      - content: "The specific measurement or result that you are trying to produce."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The business outcome is the result that your change is driving towards and looking to produce."

    - content: "As your company’s finance department starts to roll out Syntex to team members, they want to first focus on a training and onboarding strategy for these members. Which aspect of Syntex roll out would this be a part of?"
      choices:
      - content: "Fiscal outcomes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Fiscal outcomes are focused on monetary outcomes of the change, such as reduced costs and ROI."
      - content: "Agility outcomes"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Agility outcomes are about your organization’s ability to adapt to a changing market and stay innovative."
      - content: "Company readiness"
