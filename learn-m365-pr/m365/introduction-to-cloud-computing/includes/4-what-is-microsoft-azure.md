Microsoft Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud-computing platform used for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. Access to both infrastructure and services on Azure enables you to quickly deliver new and innovative features to your users. 

Here’s a short video that provides a glimpse of what Azure is and how it works.

As you’ve just seen in the video, Azure delivers the power of the cloud; you just need to know how to harness it. In fact, it contains more than 100 services, including:

- **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD or AAD)**. Provides identity management and access control capabilities for your cloud applications. It can be synchronized with an on-premises identity provider, such as Windows Server Active Directory. You can also enable single sign-on (SSO) to simplify user access to cloud applications and conditional access to prevent risky sign-ons and protect applications and data.
- **Azure Information Protection**. Protects confidential or sensitive information by using encryption, identity, and authorization policies using labels placed on files.
- **Backup**. Allows you to back up to and restore from the cloud using familiar tools in Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012/Windows Server 2012 R2, or Microsoft System Center 2012 R2/2016 Data Protection Manager.
- **Content Delivery Network**. Allows you to deliver high-bandwidth content to users around the world with low latency and high availability via a robust network of global datacenters.
- **Key Vault**. Offers a cost-effective way to safeguard keys and other secrets in the cloud using hardware security modules (HSMs).
- **Machine Learning**. Allows you to efficiently design, test, operationalize, and manage predictive analytics solutions in the cloud.
- **Media Services**. Offers cloud-based media solutions from several existing technologies, including ingest, encoding, format conversion, content protection, and both on-demand and live-streaming capabilities.
- **Mobile Services**. Provides a scalable cloud backend for building Microsoft Store, Windows Phone, Apple iOS, Android, and HTML/JavaScript applications. It can be used to store data in the cloud, authenticate users, or send push notifications to your application within minutes.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**. Helps prevent unauthorized access to both on-premises and cloud applications by having more than one method of authentication, such as a password and an authorization code sent to your smart phone.
- **Stream Analytics**. Provides an event-processing engine that helps uncover insights from devices, sensors, cloud infrastructure, and existing data properties in real time.
- **Virtual Machines**. Enables you to deploy and run a Windows Server or Linux-based computer in the cloud.
- **Virtual Network**. Enables you to create collections of virtual machines within Azure on networks in the cloud, and then securely link those networks with an on-premises network.
