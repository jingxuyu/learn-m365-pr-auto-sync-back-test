Companies that are already using video conferencing have often invested in expensive telepresence solutions or personal video communication devices. You can use Cloud Video Interop (CVI) to use these investments with Microsoft Teams meetings.

In your software development company, you have a team that purchased a video teleconferencing solution last year to enable meetings between them and a specific partner. You've been asked to assess whether it's possible for them to continue using this solution. Can the current solution continue to be used once Teams meetings have been rolled out to the rest of the company?

Here, you'll learn how CVI can connect third-party video conferencing hardware to Teams meetings.

## When to deploy CVI

Use CVI when you are migrating to Teams meetings from other solutions as an interim measure. You should aim to move these users to Teams in the medium to long term as your migration progresses.

CVI is designed to be used when:

- You have a large deployment of meeting room devices and personal video devices that aren't qualified for direct integration with Microsoft Teams.
- Your devices are supported by one of our CVI partners.
- You want to keep the value of your investment in current meeting room devices and personal video devices during the migration to a native Microsoft Teams solution.

## Steps to deploy CVI

Remember that CVI is a partner solution, so the precise steps you must take are dependent on the devices you want to support. However, the deployment always includes these generalized steps:
