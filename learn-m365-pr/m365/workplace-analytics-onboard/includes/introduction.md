Microsoft Workplace Analytics provides powerful insights about the way organizations collaborate and how work gets done. Setting up Workplace Analytics for the organization requires collaboration between the Microsoft 365 administrator and the Workplace Analytics administrator, who typically work under the direction of an overall program manager.

This module explains how people in these roles work together to set up Workplace Analytics for their organization as they:

- Assign licenses and roles
- Make privacy and configuration settings
- Prepare and upload organizational data

After these steps are completed, the Workplace Analytics web application will be available with 13 months of historical data by default.

>[!NOTE]
> The actual amount of historical data available depends on the archiving policies that have been applied to Exchange online mailboxes.

## Example scenario

You are an IT Project Leader at Contoso Corporation, which recently acquired Workplace Analytics licenses for the entire company. Working with Alex, a Microsoft 365 administrator, and Taylor, a Human Resources analyst who will serve as the Workplace Analytics administrator, you have been asked to make Workplace Analytics operational for the business. This team will have to gather input from the right stakeholders to decide how to configure Workplace Analytics, based on Contoso's unique requirements and collect and upload the organizational data that brings the Workplace Analytics insights to life.
