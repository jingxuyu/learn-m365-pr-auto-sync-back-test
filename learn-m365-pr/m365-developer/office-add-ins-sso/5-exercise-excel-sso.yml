  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What's the purpose of the `forMSGraphAccess` authorization option on the `getAccessToken()` method?"
    choices:
      - content: "When set to `false`, it tells Azure AD to perform an another check to see if the user has already consented to the requested Microsoft Graph permissions. If not, Azure AD will return an error code."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This is the opposite behavior - when set to `true`, Azure AD will do the extra check."
      - content: "When set to `true`, it tells Azure AD to perform an another check to see if the user has already consented to the requested Microsoft Graph permissions. If not, Azure AD will return an error code."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
      - content: "When set to `true`, it tells Azure AD to check only if the user has consented to the requested Microsoft Graph permissions."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "When this property is set to `true`, it performs an another check, not only check, for prior consent of Microsoft Graph permissions."
  - content: "What details are listed in the `<WebApplicationInfo>` element in an Office Add-in's manifest.xml file?"
    choices:
      - content: "The Azure AD app's URI"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "In addition to app's URI, it also contains app's ID and the permissions the app requires."
      - content: "The Azure AD app registered for the add-in, and the app's URI."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "In addition to these, it also contains the permissions the app requires."
      - content: "The Azure AD app registered for the add-in, the permissions the app requires, and the app's URI."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "What's the purpose of the `allowSignInPrompt` authorization option on the `getAccessToken()` method?"
    choices:
      - content: "When set to `true`, Office will prompt the user to sign in and consent to the requested Microsoft Graph permissions if they haven't previously done so."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Office can't prompt the user to consent to any permission other than the OpenId `profile` permission."
      - content: "When set to `true`, Office will always prompt the user to sign in when the add-in loads in the Office client."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This isn't true, because Office will only prompt the user to sign in if Office can't silently obtain an access token first."
      - content: "When set to `true`, if Office can't silently obtain an access token from Azure AD, it displays a dialog prompting the user to sign in."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct!"
