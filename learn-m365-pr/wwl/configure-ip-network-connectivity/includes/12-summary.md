This module introduced configuring network connectivity on Windows client. Administrators must understand the architecture of IPv4 and IPv6 networks and how network traffic is routed locally and externally. There are certain benefits that IPv6 provides over IPv4. IP configurations can be assigned with static information or dynamically using a DHCP service. PowerShell provides numerous options for managing clients from a command line. A number of tools, such as Event Viewer and IPConfig, can be used to diagnose network related issues.
