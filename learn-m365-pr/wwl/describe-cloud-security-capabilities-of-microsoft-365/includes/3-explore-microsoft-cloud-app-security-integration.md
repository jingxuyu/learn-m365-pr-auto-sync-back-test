## Integration with Azure AD and Azure Information Protection

In the modern workplace, it's essential to enable users to work from any location and any device and grant them access to cloud applications. Increasing collaboration needs require data to be shared with partners and external collaborators. All the while, businesses need to safeguard their organization’s data and resources.

MCAS enables businesses to identify sensitive data across cloud apps, monitor when it's shared with risky environments, and take necessary governance actions by classifying, labeling, and protecting existing and new data in your environment.

MCAS integrates with Azure AD and Azure Information Protection to deliver these capabilities in a holistic and integrated experience. It empowers businesses with a level of granularity when defining what risk means to their organization, and then gain control and visibility of any user sessions that match that definition. For example, if an employee tries to access sensitive files from a personal computer on a public network – the system can be set up to block the download altogether or allow the download.  With Azure Information Protection, the system can be configured to automatically label and protect the file in real time. It allows the business to prevent confidential information from leaking outside of the organization.

## MCAS and Advanced threat intelligence

Moving to the cloud presents a new threat vector for organizations. Attacks can introduce ransomware, compromised user accounts perform malicious activities, and overprivileged OAuth based apps can gain access to sensitive data or privileged accounts. Business can accelerate the safe adoption of cloud apps and limit the impact to your organization by leveraging sophisticated behavioral analytics.

- MCAS leverages the Intelligent Security Graph, with its billions of security signals, to power its Threat Detection.
- MCAS integrates with Secure Score to provide visibility into your Microsoft security position and provides an overview of which security features are available to reduce risk. MCAS feeds into the overall scoring and helps you protect your environment of cloud apps.

## MCAS integration with Power Automate

Power Automate is a service that helps you create automated workflow between your favorite apps and service to synchronize files, get notices, collect data, and more. Microsoft Cloud App Security integrates with Power Automate to provide custom alert automation and orchestration playbooks that help automate and orchestrate a response when specific alerts are triggered. By creating a playbook in Power Automate using Cloud App Security connector, your business can create workflows to enable customized governance options for their policies.
