    choices:

    choices:
    - content: "User-driven deployment"

      explanation: "That's incorrect. Application deployment isn't a type of Windows Autopilot deployment."
    - content: "Pre-provisioned deployment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To save your CEO time, you should pre-provision their Surface device so that it's business ready when they receive it."
