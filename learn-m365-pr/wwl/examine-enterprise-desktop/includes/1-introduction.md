The enterprise desktop has evolved and can be a challenging task given the dynamic nature of the IT world today. Just a few years ago, an enterprise desktop was typically considered an organization-owned computer or laptop that was either shared or assigned to a specific employee. Today, the enterprise desktop could be a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet. It may be owned by the organization, or it may be owned by an employee who works at an office, from home, or perhaps from a hotel room or a customer site.

Traditional management methods frequently struggle to accommodate these new scenarios. Modern management introduces new methods and concepts of deploying and maintaining the infrastructure in such a dynamic landscape.

The enterprise deployment life cycle is a framework for identifying the processes and tasks required to deploy and manage an organizationâ€™s desktops. This includes the initial planning of the entire deployment lifecycle, desktop acquisition, the deployment process itself, and post-deployment management. The lifecycle also includes how the deployment is to be supported, including upgrades, and how it will eventually be retired.
