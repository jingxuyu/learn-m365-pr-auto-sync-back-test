Letâ€™s revisit the scenario from our introduction. The leadership team at an advertising firm needed a solution to make existing Salesforce data accessible to more users across the organization. After they reached out to IT for help, an admin added and configured the Salesforce Graph connector. Now, in Microsoft Search results, users with access see a custom vertical powered by the newly configured Salesforce connector. On the work results page, they now also see a new vertical, powered by the newly configured Salesforce connector.
