After you have identified and refined your first objective, it’s time to guide the group through creating key results. This is when we’ll ask the second question.

***“How will we know we were successful?”***

Just like the objectives conversation, let’s walk through a scenario in which this question (and follow ups) unfolds.

| Attendees   | Coach   |
| ------|---------|
| <br> | *How will we know we were successful?* 
Well, we mentioned an increase the efficacy of our sellers, onboarding new partners and delving deeper into the enterprise. | *Ok, that’s a great start, let’s break those down.  What does increasing the efficacy of our sellers mean?* |
|Each of our sellers earning more revenue for the business.<br><br>Yes, we use Revenue per Head.  | *Is that something you currently measure?*|  
|We should, let’s find a specific and get back to you. | *Do we have a baseline for what that is today?*<br><br>*Great, let’s use that as our starting point, what do you think a good stretch target would be?* | 
| I’m not sure we can commit to a specific number now…how about we revisit that? | *I often find teams struggle to follow up with a target outside of the session, what about a percentage increase for now?* |
|A 25% increase would be an absolute moon shot, maybe we start with 15%. | *Great, lets put that together into a key result: "Increase revenue per head by 15%."* |

<br>What do you observe about the scenario above? 

There are a few things that we want to highlight.  First, we started with the key result question, and the team was able to recollect what they mentioned before.  From there, we worked to define the outcome they were aiming to achieve, if they could measure that, and whether they had a baseline already.   

In the absence of a baseline, the coach pushed the team find a target that they could hold themselves accountable to.  In this case, it was to focus on a percentage increase rather than an absolute number.  This is a great tactic to use with teams that gets them to establish a baseline that can be used for future metrics. 

The group isn't done after creating just one key result. Remember, there needs to be 3-5 key results per Objective, so we’ll continue with the scenario in creating more key results.

|Attendees | Coach|
| ------ | ---------|
| Another key result for us might be to run a campaign targeting multi-national companies that fit our enterprise persona and have lots of users. |*That’s a great idea for what we can do as a project, but what would the impact of that marketing campaign be?*  |
Well we’d close more multi-national companies as surface customers of course. | *Great, now we’re on the right track.  How many companies would be a stretch goal for the team?* | We currently have about 100, so upping that to 200 would be huge. | Will we be able to see a change in that measure during our time frame (semester)?| 
|Hmm, maybe not.  Our typical sales cycle is almost a year long, we might close some deals but not a large amount. | *What about growing our multi-national pipeline as a start and then focusing on closing deals next semester?* |
Good idea, if we added 500 multi-national companies to our pipeline, that would set us up well to close 200. | *And there’s our key result.  Now how would you fit that into the key result like we did before?* |
|Grow our multi-national Surface customer pipeline by 500 customers. |

<br>What do you notice this time about the above scenario? 

This time, they started with an idea about a project, and the coach guided them to think through specific outcome of the Project in order to direct them to the key result.  Mistaking a project for a key result is a common pitfall amongst teams, but one that can be worked through with an additional question:   

*What is the impact of [project]?*

Or 

*What change are we hoping to see as a result of [project]?*

Asking either of these two questions will start to guide the team back towards thinking through **how they will know they were successful** rather than what they need to do to be successful.  

Once they figured out how they'll know they were successful, the team was then able to align to a specific metric and a baseline for the other two key results in this scenario.   

Just like the above objective rubric, we have a key result rubric that you can use to evaluate a set of key results.
- Are most of our key results based on metrics?
- Do each of our metrics have a target?
- Where we don’t have a baseline for a metric, have we set a target baseline?
- Do we have offsetting quantity and quality metrics?
- Are all our key results necessary?
- Is the success of all key results sufficient to say that we were successful for our objective?
- Is our objective still the right area of focus for our Key Results?

*Let’s apply this rubric to key results we reached in our scenario example:*

Scenario Example: 
- 
Objective: Transform Surface to be an Enterprise Business 

**Key Result: Increase our revenue per head across Surface sellers by 15%**

**Key Result: Onboard 15 new Surface partners**

**Key Result: Baseline our Enterprise MAU penetration with a target of 30%**

**Key Result: Grow our multi-national customer pipeline by 500 customers**

Project: *To be completed in a later module.*

Project: *To be completed in a later module.*

A best in-class set of key results is able to address each of the questions above. When working with teams, however, focusing on getting a majority of these checked off is more realistic than achieving all of them.   

Note: key results should have an owner assigned to them as well so that once they're entered into Viva Goals, there's clear accountability and ownership. 

Once a set of key results passes the rubric, you’re ready to ask the final question.
