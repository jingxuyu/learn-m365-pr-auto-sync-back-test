Providing IT services in either environment has its accompanying costs. Here are a few that you should be aware of.

## On-premises computing costs
In a traditional, on-premises datacenter, you’ll need to pay for the following items:

- **Server costs**. This includes all hardware components and the cost of supporting them. When purchasing servers, make sure to design fault tolerance and redundancy, such as server clustering, redundant power supplies, and uninterruptable power supplies. When a server needs to be replaced or added to a datacenter, you need to pay for the computer. This can affect your immediate cash flow because you must pay for the server up front. 
- **Storage costs**. This includes all storage hardware components and the cost of supporting it. Based on the application and level of fault tolerance, centralized storage can be quite expensive. For larger organizations, you can create tiers of storage where more expensive fault‐tolerant storage is used for critical applications and lower expense storage is used for lower priority data.  
- **Network costs**. This includes all on-premises hardware components, including cabling, switches, access points, and routers. This also includes wide area network (WAN) and Internet connections. 
- **Backup and archive costs**. This is the cost to back up, copy, or archive data to the cloud or datacenter. Options might include backing up to or from the cloud. There’s an upfront cost for the hardware and additional costs for backup maintenance and consumables like tapes.
- **Organization continuity and disaster recovery costs**. Along with server fault tolerance and redundancy, you need to plan for how to recover from a disaster and continue operating. Your plan should consist of creating a data recovery site. It could also include backup generators. Most of these are upfront costs, especially if you build a data recovery site, but there’s an additional ongoing cost for the infrastructure and its maintenance.
- **Datacenter infrastructure costs**. These are costs for electricity, floor space, cooling, and building maintenance. 
- **Technical personnel**. Based on the technology used, you’ll need technical expertise and workforce to install, deploy, and manage the systems in the datacenter and at the data recovery site. 

## Cloud computing costs
With cloud computing, many of the costs associated with an on-premises datacenter are shifted to the cloud service provider. Instead of thinking about physical hardware and datacenter costs, cloud computing has a different set of costs. For accounting purposes, all these costs are operational expenses:

- **Leasing a cloud-based server**. If you lease a server or use a cloud-based server, the cost is typically based on the pay-per-use model. 
- **Leasing software and customized features**. Using a pay-per-use model requires actively managing your subscriptions to ensure users do not misuse the cloud, and that provisioned accounts are being utilized and not wasted. As soon as resources are provisioned by the provider, billing starts. It's your responsibility to deprovision the resources when they are not in use, so that you can minimize costs.
- **Scaling charges based on usage/demand instead of fixed hardware or capacity**. Cloud computing can bill in various ways, such as the number of users or CPU usage time. However, billing categories can also include allocated RAM, I/O operations per second (IOPS), and storage space. If you are connecting a datacenter to the cloud or connecting two clouds together, identify how much data needs to be transferred so that you can determine the bandwidth needed. Don’t forget to plan for backup traffic to or from the cloud, the datacenter and the cloud for data recovery purposes.
- **Billing at the user or organization level**. The subscription (or pay-per-use) model is a computing billing method that is designed for both organizations and users. The organization or user is billed for the services used, typically on a recurring basis. You can scale, customize, and provision computing resources, including software, storage, and development platforms. For example, when using a dedicated cloud service, you could pay based on server hardware and usage.
