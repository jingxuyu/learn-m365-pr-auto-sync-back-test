Messaging administration has taken on high relevance in businesses of all sizes. Because of this fact, compliance has become an essential feature for every messaging administrator to understand.

Many countries and regions have their own requirements for data protection. Besides these legal requirements, many companies must also meet regulatory requirements in their industry sector.
