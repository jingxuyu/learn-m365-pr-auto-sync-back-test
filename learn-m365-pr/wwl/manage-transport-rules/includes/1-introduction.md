Transport rules are a powerful configuration tool that enables organizations to control their message flow. For example, itâ€™s possible to use transport rules for blocking messages that match certain criteria, create CC copies of messages and send them to other recipients, or encrypt messages through Rights Management Services when they leave your organization or if they're sent to certain recipients.
