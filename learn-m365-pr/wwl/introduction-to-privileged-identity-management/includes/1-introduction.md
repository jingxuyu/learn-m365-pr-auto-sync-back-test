Identity management is the process of ensuring users in your organization have just the right privileges to complete the tasks they need to accomplish. The goal of Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is to avoid assigning excessive privileges to users. Failure to do so may lead to exploitation of privileges. This scenario results in users who can do tasks that are above their grade.

Privileged Identity Management is an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) service. It enables organizations to manage, control, and monitor access to their important resources. These resources include such things as Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, and Microsoft Intune.

In this module, you'll examine how PIM enables organizations to minimize the number of people who have access to secure information or resources. By doing so, PIM reduces the chance of a malicious actor getting that access, or an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. However, users still must carry out privileged operations in Azure AD, Azure, Microsoft 365, or SaaS apps. Organizations can give users just-in-time privileged access to Azure resources and Azure AD. There's a need for oversight for what those users are doing with their administrator privileges.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Privileged Identity Management enables you to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in your organization.
 -  Configure Privileged Identity Management for use in your organization.
 -  Describe how Privileged Identity Management audit history enables you to see all the user assignments and activations within a given time period for all privileged roles.
 -  Explain how Microsoft Identity Manager helps organizations manage the users, credentials, policies, and access within their organizations and hybrid environments.
 -  Explain how Privileged Access Management provides granular access control over privileged admin tasks in Microsoft 365.
