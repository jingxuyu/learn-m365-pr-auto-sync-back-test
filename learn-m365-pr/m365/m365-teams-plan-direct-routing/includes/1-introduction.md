Direct Routing is a complex system that requires careful planning before you deploy it. By considering your options before the roll-out, you make a smooth deployment more likely and cut the risk that any problems might impact user productivity.

Suppose you're the lead administrator for Contoso. You support over 3,000 users and a hardware-based voice over IP system for all telephony on premises. You've recently rolled out Microsoft Teams and you're using it for collaboration and video conferencing. Now you want to deploy Direct Routing across the Contoso Teams installation. You'll plan each step that needs to be taken to make the deployment a success.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- List the steps required to deploy Direct Routing.
- Describe the configuration options available for Direct Routing.
- Explain the benefits of optimizing media flow.
