Your organization has gained many years experience delivering in-person live events as part of its annual summits. You'll build on these gained skills to bring together a team to create a successful virtual event. 

## Evolve your physical events to a digital format

A team that has run in-person events need to build on their experience and tailor it to make the most of the virtual medium. The roles you need have been described in the first module of this learning path - **Introduction to delivering virtual events using Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365** module.

Now is the time to put people's names against each of these roles and bring them together to prepare them.

|Role  | Person  |
|---------|---------|
|Executive Sponsor     | A leader with a special and unique interest in the education or insights of the audience.       |
|Organizer     | Event host and team coordinator. Create the event, set permissions, curate the event link.        |
|Producer     | Responsible for starting and stopping the live event, queuing content, back channel chat. This can also be the Organizer.        |
|Presenter    | Responsible for content delivery and commentary. They can present audio, video, and share their screen with the attendees.        |
|Moderator     | Helps facilitate Teams Q & A or Yammer Conversation in a Live Event. In Teams should be a person in the meeting Organizer or Presenter role, in Yammer should be a Group Admin.        |
|IT Contact     | Ensures network and service health in advance of your event. Routes support requests.        |

### Prepare your team

You need to get time from the whole events team to be able to run at least one practice, think dress rehearsal, event. Getting time from everyone to run through the content before they do it for real sets up your event for success.

- **Organizer**: How are you going to attract people to attend your event? How you name and describe the event is a key factor to sign-ups. As is the scheduling and how you ask people to sign up.
- **Producer**: Changing from live to virtual events gives you the chance to prepare a detailed schedule of content. You can take advantage of pre-recorded content to give a natural break for the presenters and moderators. Think about creating pre-recorded video breaks between presenters to show your timetable, or prompt people about the best way to interact with your presenters. A üëãüèº or ‚ù§ is always appreciated.
- **Presenters**: The instant feedback of a crowd is missing when you present to a screen of attendees versus a live audience. If you can, think about increasing your own energy levels to compensate. Increase interactivity by using live polls, ask attendees to add their questions and ask moderators to select some for you to answer live. Structure your content to allow for breakout rooms and discussions. Focus on how you can be more interactive.
- **Moderators**: Facilitate the interaction between attendees and presenters, consider modeling the audience behavior you'd like to see. For example, add some questions to the Q & A, in Teams add reactions give a like, heart, and applaud presenters.

Use your practice events to get everyone comfortable with the tooling, and even consider having a *beta* audience to allow IT to check that network and service health are acceptable. Use the practice to gain honest feedback and make changes to content that could be better.

### Prepare your content

If you already have content that you were going to use for an in-person event, or you're creating new content, consider how to improve it for your virtual attendees. These tips will improve the engagement and accessibility of your event.

- Factor in time to make the best pre-recorded content you can. Video should be high quality, have professional captioning and audio. This means making time for the creation of content, recording it, and post-production.
- Create an agenda with a flexible schedule to cater for live segments over or underrunning. Think about what you want people to see on their screens when there isn't a presenter.
- Have slides and scripts checked for accessibility and inclusivity. Have them available to share with attendees before your event or make them available after if you can.
- Shorter sessions as virtual events are more tiring for presenters and attendees. Everyone will benefit if you can change what would have been a one or two hour keynote into three or four 30-minute sessions.
- Up level your production values, can you have presenters and slides on the screen at the same time? Can you add lower thirds or other graphics and animations?
- In Q & A sessions, allow enough silence to accommodate for audio delays. Have your moderators pre-seed questions that you have good answers for.
- Use the best hardware you can to improve presenters video and audio. This can include external mics, video cameras, and improved lighting.
- Do you need to you offer Sign Language interpretation? How will you support this alongside a live presentation?

### Prepare your attendees

Everyone's time is valuable so being clear about what people can hope to gain from attending your event. This starts with making the name and description of your event understandable.

Think about asking all attendees to download Teams for desktop, or to upgrade their web browsers to the latest version.

If you know that your audience isn't experienced with Teams, consider including links to Teams guides on attending events with your event invitation.

- Give everyone time to prepare - this can be reduced after everyone has gained experience
- Check your service and network health with your IT department
- Focus on the quality of your content - is your message clear
- Presenters should be able to practice - they are the heart of your event
- Plan time for your whole team to rehearse - keep the morale high and be flexible
