There are two primary ways for you to set up co-management. It's important to understand the prerequisites for each path. They each require some combination of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, and Windows 10.

Once you decide to move to Configuration Manager or extend your existing Configuration Manager solution, there are two main paths to reach co-management:

- **Path 1: Existing Configuration Manager clients**: You have Windows 10 devices that are already Configuration Manager clients. You set up hybrid Azure AD, and enroll them into Intune.
- **Path 2: New internet-based devices**: You have new Windows 10 devices that join Azure AD and automatically enroll to Intune. You install the Configuration Manager client to reach a co-management state.
