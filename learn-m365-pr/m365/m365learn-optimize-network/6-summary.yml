  questions:

    - content: 'The difference between the Optimize and Allow categories of endpoints is:'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Optimize endpoints are required for connectivity to all Microsoft 365 services. Allow endpoints are required for connectivity to general Internet locations.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Default category endpoints are for general Internet locations.
    - content: 'Optimize endpoints are for edge devices. Allow endpoints are for client browsers.'
      isCorrect: true
      incorrectExplanation: Categories of endpoints are for Microsoft 365 services, not for browsers or edge devices.
    - content: 'Optimize endpoints are required for connectivity to any Office 365 service over ExpressRoute. Allow endpoints are required for connectivity to specific Office 365 services and features.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Traffic categories are not dependent on ExpressRoute.
    - content: 'Optimize endpoints are for fast-path connectivity to any Office 365 service. Allow endpoints are required for medium-path connectivity to specific Office 365 services and features.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Categories of endpoints are for Microsoft 365 services, not for the speed of the path to them.
    - content: 'None of the above.'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: Optimize endpoints are required for connectivity to all Microsoft 365 services. Allow endpoints are required for connectivity to specific Microsoft 365 services.

    - content: 'How many latency problems are there with this configuration: Branch office traffic goes over a WAN connection to a regional office that uses a local ISP with a non-local DNS server.'
    choices: 
    - content: 'None. This is the recommended configuration to maximize traffic performance.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 
    - content: '1'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 
    - content: '2'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: The WAN backbone and the non-local DNS server add traffic latency.
    - content: '3'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 

    - content: 'What are two ways that a cloud-hosted network appliance that performs duplicate security processing can impact performance to Microsoft 365 workloads?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Additional path length and unnecessary processing.'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 
    - content: 'Additional path length and hops along the WAN backbone.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 
    - content: 'Additional path length and redundant monitoring from the security service.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 
    - content: 'Round-trip path and unnecessary processing.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: 

    - content: 'Why should you bypass network processing for Optimize and Allow traffic to Microsoft 365 workloads?'
    choices: 
    - content: 'Microsoft’s network is a known and secured set of Internet resources. You can get rid of your edge network devices.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Edge devices are needed for general Internet traffic.
    - content: 'Microsoft’s network is a known and secured set of Internet resources. Duplicate security processing is not needed.'
      isCorrect: true
      correctExplanation: 
    - content: 'Microsoft’s network is a known and secured set of Internet resources. Duplicate security processing introduces security risks from hackers.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Security processing reduces security risks from hackers.
    - content: 'Microsoft’s network is just like any other Internet resource. Duplicate security processing is not needed.'
      isCorrect: false
      incorrectExplanation: Duplicate security processing is not needed because Microsoft’s network is NOT just like any other Internet resource.
