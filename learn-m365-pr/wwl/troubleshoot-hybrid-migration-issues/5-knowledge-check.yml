  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You are troubleshooting mail flow in your hybrid Exchange deployment. You want find out if Exchange marked a message as originating in Exchange or incoming. Which email header should you check?"
    choices:
    - content: "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthAs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The X-MS-Exchange-Organization-AuthAs header records whether the message was sent by an authenticated or anonymous client."
    - content: "X-MS-Exchange-Organization-MessageDirectionality"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The X-MS-Exchange-Organization-MessageDirectionality header records whether Exchange classified the email as originating within the hybrid system or incoming from an external email system."
    - content: "Authentication-Results."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Authentication-Results header stores the results of antispam queries against DNS records."
  - content: "You have a hybrid Exchange deployment. You're trying to find out why Exchange Online mailboxes can't access public folders, which are stored on-premises. What value should the Get-OrganizationConfig cmdlet report for the PublicFoldersEnabled property when you run it in the Exchange Online PowerShell to enable this access?"
    choices:
    - content: "True."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The PublicFoldersEnabled property is not a boolean property."
    - content: "Local."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If the PublicFoldersEnabled property is set to Local in Exchange Online, cloud mailboxes can only access public folders stored in Exchange Online."
    - content: "Remote"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To enable Exchange Online users to access public folder store on-premises, the PublicFoldersEnabled property should be set to Remote."
  - content: "You're using the Exchange Admin Center to create a new migration batch, but you receive an error when you try to create a migration endpoint. Which of the following could cause this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "The data consistency score for a mailbox in the previous migration batch was poor."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A poor data consistency score might prevent the current migration completing but it doesn't cause errors when you create endpoints for subsequent batches."
    - content: "The migration batch is larger than 5,000 mailboxes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A large batch of mailboxes might result in a migration that lasts a long time but doesn't cause an error when you create the migration endpoint."
    - content: "A firewall is configured to block all traffic on TCP 443."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The wizard can only create a migration endpoint in Exchange on-premise if it can connect to that server on TCP port 443."
