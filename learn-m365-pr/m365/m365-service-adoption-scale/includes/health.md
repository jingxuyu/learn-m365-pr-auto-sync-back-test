**A service review is a joint meeting of service adoption, IT leaders, and business stakeholders to discuss the usage, health, quality, and performance of a given service.** This process is commonly done within IT without including business stakeholders or adoption personnel. In our best practices, we advocate involving a broader audience to drive agile change management within your company. **A "service" is a collection of technical capabilities that deliver a specific business outcome.** For instance, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and Exchange all deliver collaboration services. You may opt to start with issues relevant to business users and then allow them to leave before you dive deeper into technical discussions or other items that might not be relevant to your business stakeholders.

A standard agenda for a service health review would include the following items:

- Service charter and scope
- Service options and project status
- Health and measures including usage, incident, and support data
- Continuous Improvement Roadmap
- Issues and Asks for discussion

Both the service adoption leader and the IT professional (sometimes the same person) should collaborate on the service health review. In large organizations service health reviews are conducted monthly, while smaller organizations may opt for a six-week or bi-monthly schedule. The risk with longer intervals between the review cycle is that misalignments between parties can remain undisclosed and unresolved. No matter the size of your organization, the best practice is to hold reviews monthly.
