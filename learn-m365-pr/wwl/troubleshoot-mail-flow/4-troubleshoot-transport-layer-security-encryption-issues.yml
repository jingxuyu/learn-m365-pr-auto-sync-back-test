  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Message administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to configure mutual TLS to secure a connector to Fabrikam, one of Contoso's partner organizations. Securing a connector to Fabrikam will enable Holly to manage secured message paths between domains over the Internet. In this configuration, how should the Contoso mailbox server verify the identity of the Fabrikam mailbox server?"
    choices:
    - content: "By reviewing the receive protocol log for STARTTLS events that are marked successful"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't how the Contoso mailbox server will verify the identity of the Fabrikam mailbox server. Try again."
    - content: "By validating the certificate provided by the Fabrikam mailbox server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. An organization should configure mutual TLS to secure a connector to a partner organization. In this configuration, each mailbox server should verify the identity of the other server by validating the certificate the other mailbox server provides. This design is an easy way for administrators to manage secured message paths between domains over the Internet."
    - content: "By verifying the identity of the server that's stored in Fabrikam's MX record"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't how the Contoso mailbox server will verify the identity of the Fabrikam mailbox server. Try again."
