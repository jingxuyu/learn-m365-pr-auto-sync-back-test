In the past, Woodgrove has failed to take advantage of new capabilities, and has historically spent much resource effort to update devices in the production environment. Your technical director wants to avoid this situation in future. You've been asked to outline a plan for how Woodgrove could modernize its environment to improve productivity, reduce cost, effort, and time with Windows servicing.

## Inputs

You’ll need to look at what new features and improvements are available, and assess your current situation, to understand how you might need to modernize your environment.

### Investigate new features and improvements

Make sure you take advantage of resources that will help you monitor for improvements that are available for all of the tooling and components across your environment.  

- **Review IT Pro features of Windows 10**: The "what’s new in Windows 10" page lists improvements for IT Pros. Reviewing these capabilities against your current environment helps to determine what features to communicate to remote workers, and what IT Professionals should use to support them.  
- **Join the Windows 10 TechCommunity**: Learn about technical best practices, tips and tricks, and the latest news and trends about Windows 10 and the Windows client OS at TechCommunity.
- **Configuration Manager**: Keep up to date by tracking all the new changes in each incremental new version.

> You'll find links to these resources in the **Learn more** section at the end of this module.

The information you’ve collected from testing and tracking new features and capabilities will help you figure out how Woodgrove can modernize its environment.

### Assess your state

Assess the state of your environment to understand where you want to go. You do this assessment by defining high-level goals for your environment, and deciding which phase those goals are applicable to. For example:

Consider your goals to get a better understanding of what the aim should be for each component and tool in your environment. For example, Woodgrove might be using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) today for software update management. But you might decide that you want to move to Windows Update for Business so that updates are delivered by the cloud-based Windows Update Service for your organization.

## Decisions

Use the knowledge gained from the investigations and assessment of your state to help you understand how to invest in new tooling and capabilities. Ask what your organization will need to modernize in its tools and capabilities from stakeholders in the process.

 For instance, critical application testing can be time-consuming, so developers could suggest automated testing. You can outline your goal, along with what investments are needed to achieve it. For example:

## Tasks

Identify the tasks you’ll have to carry out to modernize your organization’s environment. You can complete this process by: 

- **Determining infrastructure changes**. For example, the End-User Computing group identifies that, to accommodate the new capabilities, it will have to increase the capacity of the hardware that's running your infrastructure.
- **Determining configuration changes**. The security group might decide that it will have to review policy changes to ensure you still meet security baselines when moving encryption keys to a cloud-based service.

Create a proposal for changes that Woodgrove needs to carry out to modernize its environment.  Your organization can then also determine its Go/No Go criteria for proposed changes. The proposal should be reviewed and approved by someone with the authority to allocate the resources needed to implement the intended changes. After a proposal has been reviewed and approved, the changes can then be implemented.

## Outputs

Create and update the following artifacts that will help you capture the details about your modernization approach for the next phase:
