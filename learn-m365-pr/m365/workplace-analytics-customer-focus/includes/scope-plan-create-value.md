Now that you've learned many of the customer focus business topics Workplace Analytics can address, the next step is to take action and create an analysis project that identifies opportunities in the topics that interest you and your organization.

## What is the best way to plan my customer focus analysis?

There are three actions you can take to plan your Workplace Analytics customer focus analysis:

1. **Project scope** - Scoping your project includes identifying hypotheses or business priorities, and scoping questions, such as stakeholder engagement, and the population and timeframe you would like to analyze.
2. **Data analysis** - Planning your analysis includes identifying the specific business questions you would like to answer, understanding data requirements, and identifying the metrics and queries you need to run for your analysis.
3. **Value creation** - Creating value includes analyzing to identify opportunities, creating change tactics, and figuring out the ways you'll track and share the results of your analysis.

This three-tiered process enables you to create a robust diagnostic plan for your customer focus analysis with Workplace Analytics.

## Project scope

To achieve a result that identifies opportunities and targets the right groups for your customer focus initiative, it is important to identify business priorities and consider the scope of your analysis.

### Identify business priorities

Before you begin your analysis, identify the core business priorities that will drive your customer focus initiative.

Are your priorities related to...

* External collaboration?
* Internal collaboration?
* Coaching and onboarding?

Identifying core priorities and defining the business questions you want to answer are key to an impactful customer focus initiative. Refer to the **External collaboration**, **Internal collaboration**, and **Coaching and onboarding** subtopics in the previous unit to help you identify your customer focus priorities. You can use these priorities to create guiding questions for your customer focus analysis with Workplace Analytics.

### Consider key scoping questions

There are a few other questions to consider before you begin your customer focus analysis with Workplace Analytics.

**Stakeholder engagement.**

* Who are the key stakeholders?
* Do you have approval to access the required data?
* What are the goals of each stakeholder?

**Required data.**

* Does the data include the necessary organizational attributes?
* Do you plan to include top performers? If so, do you have performance data?
* Do you plan to use CRM data? If so, have you identified how you will collect the CRM data?

**Employee scope and timeframe.**

* Which employees will be included?
* Are you focusing on a specific segment in the organization?
* What timeframe will you analyze?

Scope your project to clarify your objectives, ensure the right people are involved, and select the appropriate population and timeframe for your analysis. Get the right support and approvals ahead of time and create a targeted plan for your analysis to ensure a smooth and successful customer focus initiative.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To bring the most value to your customer focus analysis, you need to include sales-related attributes in the organizational data, or the data from your organization's CRM database. Workplace Analytics has an option to upload CRM data. For more detailed information on data requirements for each topic, and instructions on uploading CRM data, see the **Learn more** links at the end of this unit.

## Data analysis

To create a quality customer focus analysis that will achieve the greatest impact, it is important to tailor the analysis to core business needs. This requires creating guiding questions, understanding the data requirements, and identifying the key metrics and Workplace Analytics queries you will run to get the data.

### Create guiding questions

Before you begin analyzing the data, it is important to have business questions that frame your customer focus analysis. Here are some examples of business questions related to customer focus:

* **External time allocation** - Do employees spend enough time with accounts?
* **Account management** - Are employees being assigned the right number of accounts by territory?
* **Teaming** - Are resources dedicated to the right accounts?
* **Cross-team collaboration** - Are external-facing teams getting internal support?
* **Internal meeting culture** - What type of meetings (size and length) do teams attend?
* **Manager coaching** - Are sales employees getting enough coaching? Has it been effective?

Understand your core business priorities and create the guiding questions that frame your customer focus analysis. Choose from the business questions presented in the previous unit or create your own. Use these questions as a starting point to identify opportunities as you analyze the data.

### Understand data requirements

It is important to secure data that helps you answer customer focus business questions. For example, if you are analyzing external collaboration with customers, you'll likely need data from your CRM database.
Data required for a customer focus analysis can include:

* CRM data
* Quota attainment data
* Frontline employee attributes
* Role or function attributes
* Account revenue information
* Organizational attributes (to group the population by)
* Performance data (for coaching effectiveness)

Ensure you have the right data for your customer focus analysis. This will enable you to see the external parties or customers that employees spend the most time with, allow you to group the population by customer-focused attributes, and measure collaboration against performance outcomes.

For more detailed information on the data required for your analysis, see the link to the Resource playbooks under **Learn more** and download the Customer Focus Playbook.

### Understand data requirements

To get the data for your analysis, you will need to run one or more Workplace Analytics queries. The queries you will run for your analysis will depend on the metrics you'd like to analyze.

For example:

* If you would like to answer business questions related to External time allocation, you will need the *Collaboration hours external* metric from a *Person query*.
* Or, if you would like to measure cross-team collaboration, you will need the collaboration hours between time investors and collaborator groups from a *Group-to-group query*.

Define the key metrics you will analyze and run the queries needed for your customer focus analysis.

Provide a clear definition of the data, metrics, and queries you need for your analysis. Doing this at the planning stage reduces coordination after analysis has started and simplifies the effort overall.

## Value creation

After your analysis is complete, it is important to identify what actions you'll take, and establish how you'll measure, track, and share the information with your organization.

### Define next steps and create change tactics

The first step is to get the most out of your customer focus analysis by defining what's next. Begin with the results that identify opportunities and define the target groups for your customer focus initiative. Then, discuss the potential change tactics you can implement to drive change in your organization.

To create customer focus change tactics:

* Define tactics that will achieve the desired outcome.
* Identify the level of effort for each tactic.
* Determine the metrics you will use to measure and track progress.

Define next steps and create change tactics to realize value and drive positive change with your customer focus initiative.

For specific examples of customer focus change levers, see the Resource playbooks link in **Learn more** and download the Customer Focus Playbook.

### Track and share information

After identifying target groups and implementing your customer focus change tactics, it is important to share the information with employees and track progress to ensure success. To do this, you canâ€¦

Enable Microsoft 365 tools:

* Personal insights in Viva Insights
* Seller success plan in Workplace Analytics

Implement change tactics:

* Utilize Workplace Analytics and Viva Insights best practices.
* Get context from interviews, surveys, and workshops.
* Leverage influential employees to drive success.
