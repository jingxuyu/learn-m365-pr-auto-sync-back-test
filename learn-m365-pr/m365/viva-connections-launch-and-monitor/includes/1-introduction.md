Once you’ve got Viva Connections ready, it’s time to let the rest of the
organization know that it's available for use. Before you launch,
however, you will want to test the user experience to make sure
everything is ready to go for all user groups. In this module, you’ll
learn how to test and refine Viva Connections before the whole
organization has access. You’ll also learn strategies that will help
ensure a smooth adoption of Viva Connections with all employees.
Finally, you will learn how to use metrics to determine the best ways to
keep your employees connected and informed with Viva Connections.
