Identity and access management helps your users to access the appropriate set of resources, at the right times, from an appropriate  device. In today’s mixed technology environments with both personal and corporate owned devices traveling through an organization, controlling access to critical corporate resources can be tricky. But implementing a solution to help protect your critical corporate data will help reduce your risk of improper access and use to your data. 
Within a modern IT infrastructure, this process can become complex because a specific individual might need to authenticate to several systems and gain access to multiple apps by using a variety of devices or perform a variety of management tasks within those systems. 

To ensure identities are protected and correct access is granted to users, you’ll need to implement a solid identity lifecycle management and access management strategy:

Identity lifecycle management implementation: 

- **Provision accounts**. Assign users in your organization access to your systems. 
- **Manage administrative roles**. Limit users that have administrative privileges. These should be limited in number to help reduce risk. 
- **Assign permissions**. Users need access to resources and apps. This access requires permissions. Ensuring that user accounts are assigned only the necessary permissions is a significant part of account management. 
- **Retire accounts**. When people leave organizations or change jobs, you must be able to deprovision the appropriate user account, or, where suitable, repurpose the account. This might involve unassigning roles, removing permissions, or changing account properties.  

Access management implementation:
- **Provide seamless access to all your apps** - Connect your users with your apps and data using a cloud-based identity and access management solution for your hybrid environment.
- **Use intelligent identity protection and security** - Protect accounts from being compromised and increase security by leveraging artificial intelligence, continuous detection, and actionable insights. 
- **Use efficient identity management at scale** - Stay in control and reduce costs by automating user changes, enforcing policies, and providing self-service options to your users. 
- **Connect with partners and customers** - Connect and collaborate with customers and partners easily and more securely while managing access and helping protect user privacy. 

One of the most critical factors in identity management is to assign the correct rights, privileges, and permissions to the appropriate user accounts. If you are managing an enterprise environment where accounts exist in multiple locations (such as AD DS, Microsoft 365 , and potentially other directory services), implementing a strong identity management solution can easily get complicated. 

To streamline your administrative effort, try to implement a solution that enables you to define a single account for a given entity (a user or a device). You can then grant that account access to resources and apps across potentially multiple platforms. This is also beneficial for your users as they must remember fewer disparate account details. 

One option is to consider synchronizing your accounts between the various directory services. For  example, you can install and configure Azure AD Connect to synchronize accounts from your on-premises AD DS  to your Microsoft 365 Azure AD tenant. 

**Identity Protection**. Many of today’s successful cyberattacks are based on identity theft. This makes identity protection—particularly user accounts that have privileges— critical for organizations of all sizes.

People have many different accounts, both work and personal that could include Microsoft, Apple, Google, Social accounts and more. With so many accounts, users try to simplify their lives by using a single simple password. If any one of these accounts and passwords is stolen, it’s highly likely that other identities will be at risk. 

Because of this, it’s necessary to have an identity protection strategy. Identity protection is a set of technologies that you implement to help proactively monitor user behavior, especially during authentication, and to take actions if risk or vulnerability is detected. 

For example, if you notice that a user starts signing in from a different city or at peculiar times of the day (such as out of office hours), or if the user makes several failed password attempts, that suggests suspicious activity, and it might indicate that a user account is compromised. Implementing an identity protection system can help identify these issues and help to protect the integrity of your account infrastructure. 

**Role-based access**. Controlling access to business-critical resources is important for any organization. Making sure the right users have access to the right resources ensures both business continuity as well as prevents unintended access to information and resources. Within an IT organization, you can assign Role-based access controls for Intune and Azure AD roles. For example, you can configure Group administrators separate from user administrators, separate from Intune service administrators. Users can be assigned multiple roles, depending on need. 

When configuring access, consider assigning users the least privilege access control. By only assigning specific access to the specific resources they need, you can help improve the security of your organization. 

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**. Many authentication systems are based on simple password exchange, which is not a very secure approach. By using multiple factors to authenticate, you can achieve significant security improvements. MFA relies on users identifying themselves with at least two authentication factors: 
- Something the user knows, such as a username and password or a PIN
- Something the user has, such as a digital certificate or smartcard
- Something the user is, as indicated by the use of facial recognition, fingerprint, or other biometrics. 

MFA is provided in Office 365, in Microsoft Azure Multi-Factor Authentication as an additional add-on, and within Windows 10 through the Windows Hello feature.
