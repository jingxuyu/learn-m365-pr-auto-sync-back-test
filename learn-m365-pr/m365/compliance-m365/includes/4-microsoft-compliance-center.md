The new experience helps you reduce compliance risks and protect your digital estate more easily and effectively with three new insights:
- With the Compliance Manager integration, Microsoft 365 compliance center provides you with visibility into your compliance posture against key regulations and standards like the GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and more on the homepage. You can then perform risk assessments and follow step-by-step guidance to enhance your compliance and privacy controls.
- Additionally, to help you label data more accurately, Microsoft 365 Label Analytics preview can enable you to analyze and validate how sensitivity and retention labels are being used beyond your Office 365 workloads. 
- Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS) insights are also available in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to help you identify compliance risks across applications, discover shadow IT, and monitor employeesâ€™ non-compliant behaviors.
