**Module scenario**

Contoso, Ltd. is a midsize financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Contoso has migrated existing Remote Desktop Services to Windows Virtual Desktop, so they no longer need to manage basic infrastructure components like Remote Desktop Session Host servers and gateways. Theyâ€™re also using Microsoft 365 and Azure for file management options at the user and file share level.

Most of their employees are using Windows 10 devices and they frequently work from remote locations. All of the employees are using Microsoft 365 apps. Users from different department are using different applications that require multiple images to be created. The Contoso IT director is aware that image management is time consuming and requires management of the applications and Windows updates for each individual image.

Contoso is considering using the new Microsoft application delivery technology MSIX app attach, to separate applications from master images.

As a senior administrator in Contoso, you've been asked to adopt the application delivery method and to use the MSIX app attach in your Windows Virtual Desktop environment.
