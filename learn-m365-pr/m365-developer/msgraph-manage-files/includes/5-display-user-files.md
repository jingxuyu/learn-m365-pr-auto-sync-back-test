Before a user can download a file, we need to show a list of available files. In this Learn module, the files will be in the user's OneDrive for Business root directory. You might want to drop a file or two there to start. You can access your instance of OneDrive for Business by browsing to https://www.office.com/, signing in, and selecting the OneDrive icon.

## Decide which permissions your app requires

All data exposed by Microsoft Graph is secured. Your app needs to have the right permissions granted to access it. The permission needed depends on the type of information that your app needs to access. For example, to access the user's calendar, your app needs to have the `Calendars.Read` permission. To read a user's files, your app needs the `Files.Read` permission. Later, when it's time to upload files, your app will need the `Files.ReadWrite` permission. The exact list of the permissions required for each operation is available in the Microsoft Graph API reference.

If your app loads different types of data, users must grant it multiple permissions required to access this information. In your app, request only the permissions that you need. In this module, your app requests permission to read your files initially and only asks for read/write permission when you try to upload a file. This pattern is called *dynamic consent*, and it's the recommended way to request permissions. With dynamic consent, users control the data they share with the apps they use, which minimizes security risks.

## Specify the necessary permissions

The list of permissions granted to your app is baked right into the access token. The OAuth standard calls them *scopes*. When your application uses the Microsoft Authentication Library to get the access token, it needs to include a list of scopes in the request to Azure Active Directory. Each operation in Microsoft Graph has its own list of scopes organized from least to most privileged. Any one of them will work, so choose the least-privileged scopes that will work across the operations used in your application.

The sample application stores the current Microsoft Authentication Library request in a global variable called `msalRequest`. Initially, it contains an empty array of scopes.

```javascript
const msalRequest = { scopes: [] };
```

Here's the helper function used by the sample application to add more scopes to the request.

```javascript
function ensureScope (scope) {
    if (!msalRequest.scopes.some((s) => s.toLowerCase() === scope.toLowerCase())) {
        msalRequest.scopes.push(scope);
    }
}
```

The idea is that the application requests permissions when it needs them. For example, here's the code to download a list of files from a user's OneDrive for Business root folder.

```javascript
async function getFiles() {
    ensureScope('files.read');
    try {
        const response = await graphClient
            .api('/me/drive/root/children')
            .select('id,name,folder,package')
            .get();
        return response.value;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

The call to `ensureScope()` ensures that `files.read` permission is included in the access token that will be used to call Microsoft Graph.

The Microsoft Graph SDK takes care of calling the Microsoft Authentication Library by using the `msalRequest` object, and it does that for every Microsoft Graph call. While this activity might seem wasteful, it's not. The Microsoft Authentication Library automatically reuses the same access token until the old one expires or the permission scopes change. At the top of *graph.js*, you can see the code where this instruction is set up.

```javascript
const authProvider = {
    getAccessToken: async () => {
        return await getToken();
    }
};
const graphClient =
    MicrosoftGraph.Client.initWithMiddleware({ authProvider });
```

First, the code declares an `auth` provider, which is a JSON object that contains the `getAccessToken()` function. This function calls `getToken()`, which is a function in the *auth.js* file that calls the Microsoft Authentication Library. You can check that out if you want to. The `auth` provider object is passed to the Microsoft SDK, which will call `getAccessToken()` whenever it needs to, so your code doesn't have to.

## Retrieve the files in the user's OneDrive root directory by using Microsoft Graph

To get this list of files, use the `/me/drive/root/children` resource. It's easier to get the files in the root folder of the current user's OneDrive root directory because Microsoft Graph provides shortcuts like `/me` and `/root`. For example, to enumerate files in another user's Documents folder would require you to look up the user's user ID and the item ID of their /Documents folder and then access `/users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/children`.

> [!TIP]
> Microsoft Graph provides access to files in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint Online. Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 services store files in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. The file operations are the same, but the resources (URLs) are a little different for each of these services.

This GET request is expressed in the Microsoft Graph SDK as follows:

```javascript
const response = await graphClient
    .api('/me/drive/root/children')
    .get();

```

You can make the call more efficient by specifying the data columns that are needed. This task is handled by using the `$select= query` string parameter in REST (based on the OData standard). The SDK makes it easier by providing a `select()` function. Notice that the functions can be chained to make the request easy to read.

```javascript
        const response = await graphClient
            .api('/me/drive/root/children')
            .select('id,name,folder,package')
            .get();
```

Let's put everything you've learned to practice and extend your app to show a list of files in the user's OneDrive for Business root folder.
