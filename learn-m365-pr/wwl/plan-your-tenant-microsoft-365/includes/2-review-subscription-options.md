One of your first actions when planning for Microsoft 365 is examining the available subscriptions and determining which one best satisfies your organization’s requirements. Choosing the right subscription ensures that users have access to the necessary features and services.

If you choose a subscription that offers more than you need, you end up paying for services and features that you never use. Conversely, if you choose a subscription based solely on price, it may not have the features and services that meet your organization’s requirements. To prepare for your Microsoft 365 project, you must become familiar with the functionality and subscriptions provided by each Microsoft 365 plan:

 -  Microsoft 365 Business
 -  Microsoft 365 Enterprise
 -  Microsoft 365 Education
