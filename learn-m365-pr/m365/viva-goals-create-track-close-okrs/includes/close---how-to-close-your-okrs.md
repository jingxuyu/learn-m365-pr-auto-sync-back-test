The last of the **4Cs** is Closing. At the end of the relevant OKR time period, you will close your Key Results and score them based on your judgement of the progress made. You will also be prompted to provide a **Closing Note** based on your reflections and learnings. These reflections will be critical in feeding into the process of writing your OKRs for the next time period.
