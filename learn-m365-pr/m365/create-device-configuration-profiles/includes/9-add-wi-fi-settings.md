Wi-Fi is a wireless network that's used by many mobile devices to get network access. Microsoft Intune includes built-in Wi-Fi settings that can be deployed to users and devices in your organization. Once assigned, your users get access to your organization's Wi-Fi network without configuring it themselves.

You can use device configuration profiles to configure Wi-Fi settings for the following device platforms:
- **Android device administrator**
- **Android Enterprise**
- **iOS/iPadOS**
- **macOS**
- **Windows 10 and later**
- **Windows 8.1 and later**

Use the following steps to create a new iOS/iPadOS configuration profile.

## Step 1: Create a Wi-Fi device configuration profile for iOS/iPadOS devices
1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **Configuration profiles** > **Create profile**.<br>
   The **Create a profile** pane is displayed.
3. Select **iOS/iPadOS** from the dropdown box under **Platform**.
4. Select **Wi-Fi** from the dropdown box under **Profile type**.
5. Click **Create**.

## Step 2: Add basic profile values
1. Next to **Name**, add "Wi-Fi - iOS/iPadOS".
2. *[Optional]* Add a **Description** for your new profile.
3. Click **Next**.

## Step 3: Add configuration settings
1. Next to **Wif-Fi type**, select **Basic**.
2. Next to **Network name**, enter "iOS/iPadOS Wi-Fi settings". 
3. Next to **SSID**, enter the name of your organization.<br>
   The Service Set Identifier (SSID) is the name of the Wi-Fi connection.
4. Select **Enable** next to **Connect automatically**.
5. Ensure **Disable** is selected next to **Hidden network**.
6. Select **WPA/WPA2-Personal** next to **Security type**.<br>
   This setting is the security protocol to use for Wi-Fi authentication.
7. Enter a password as a **pre-shared key**.<br>
   When your organization's network is set up or configured, a password or network key is also configured. Enter this password or network key for the pre-shared key (PSK) value.
8. Select **Manual** next to **Proxy settings**.<br>
   Ensure that this proxy configuration is used by your organization.
9. Enter a **Proxy server address**.<br>
   This is the IP address of the proxy server.
10. Enter a **Port number**.<br>
   If your proxy server uses a particular port, enter the port number.
11. Ensure that **Disable MAC address randomization** is set to **Not configured**.
12. Select **Next**.

## Step 4: Assign profile to group
For this device configuration profile, you can skip assigning this profile to any groups, users, or devices until you've created users and enrolled devices.
1. Click **Next**.

## Step 5: Review + create
1. Review the values and settings for this configuration profile.
2. Click **Create**.

> [!TIP]
> If you use certificate based authentication for your Wi-Fi profile, deploy the Wi-Fi profile, certificate profile, and trusted root profile to the same groups to ensure that each device can recognize the legitimacy of your certificate authority.  For more information, see [How to configure certificates with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/protect/certificates-configure).

You've now created a new device configuration profile named "Wi-Fi - iOS/iPadOS". You can see the new configuration profile in the list by selecting **Devices** > **Configuration profiles**. For more information about iOS/iPadOS Wi-Fi configuration settings in Intune, see [Add Wi-Fi settings for iOS and iPadOS devices in Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune//configuration/wi-fi-settings-ios).
