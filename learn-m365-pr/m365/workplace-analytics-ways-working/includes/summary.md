Your company wanted to effectively deploy and measure the impact of some initiatives designed to streamline ways of working, reduce burnout risk, and boost manager effectiveness. To do this, you needed data tracking employees' work behaviors and collaboration patterns.

By using the Workplace Analytics Ways of working assessment dashboard, you were able to surface the insights you needed, enabling your CHRO to understand how long and through what modes people across your company collaborate. You were able to identify pockets of burnout risk, and to see trends in manager coaching. Your CHRO can now prioritize transformation initiatives based on need, and focus interventions on the employee groups who will benefit the most.

It would be difficult to build a similar report from scratch without Workplace Analytics data and the Ways of working assessment tool. Even if your CHRO has approval to access raw collaboration data, you would have to figure out how to gather it for all users, make sense of it, calculate business metrics, and maintain employee privacy and data security. Only then could you build your Ways of working assessment report.

The Ways of working assessment helped you quantify the impact of your company's cultural transformation and recommend measurable changes that boost employee engagement, increase productivity, and unlock more agile ways of working, saving valuable time for people across the entire organization.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Explain what the Workplace Analytics Power BI Ways of working Assessment dashboard is, and why it provides an important perspective.
- Run queries, load the data, and select your settings.
- Interpret the results from multiple reports in the dashboard.
