This module introduced you to transport rules. Transport rules are a powerful configuration tool that enables organizations to control their message flow. For example, transport rules enable organizations to:

 -  block messages that match certain criteria.
 -  create CC copies of messages and send them to other recipients.
 -  encrypt messages through Rights Management Services when they leave your organization or if they're sent to certain recipients.

You learned in this module that you can use transport rules in Exchange to look for specific conditions on messages that pass through your organization and then act on those messages. Transport rules apply policies on messages while theyâ€™re in transit through the transport pipeline. The purpose of transport rules is to help protect corporate network resources and data by applying an action to messages meeting specified conditions.

This module explained how transport rules for Exchange mailbox servers are stored in Active Directory. You also learned that Edge Transport servers that aren't domain joined can't access them. As such, to accommodate transport rules for inbound and outbound Internet mail flow, you must create Edge Transport rules that are located on Edge Transport servers.

You also learned that transport rules provide you with an almost limitless ability to control messaging in your Exchange Server organization. As a result, messaging administrators must carefully plan their transport rules to ensure they behave as intended. Failure to do so could result in accidentally deleted messages, or messages delivered to unintended recipients.
