To create a VPN connection in Windows, use the following procedure:

1.  In Windows 10, tap the **Network** icon in the notification area, and then tap **Network settings,** or in Windows 11, right-click the **Network** icon and select **Network and Internet settings**.
2.  In **Network &amp; internet**, tap the **VPN** tab.
3.  Tap **Add a VPN connection**.
4.  In the **Add a VPN connection** dialog box, in the **VPN provider** list, tap Windows (built-in).
5.  In the **Connection name** box, enter a meaningful name, such as Office Network.
6.  In the **Server name or address** text box, type the FQDN of the server to which you want to connect. This is usually the name of the VPN server.
7.  In the **VPN type** list, select between **Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), L2TP/IPsec with certificate, L2TP/IPSec with pre-shared key, Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP)**, **and IKEv2**. This setting must match the setting and policies configured on your VPN server. If you are unsure, tap Automatic.
8.  In the **Type of sign-in info** list, select either **User name and password, Smart card, One-time password**, or **Certificate**. Again, this setting must match your VPN server policies.
9.  In the **User name (optional)** box, type your user name, and then in the **Password (optional)** box, type your password. Select the Remember my sign-in info check box, and then tap Save.

To manage your VPN connection from within Network &amp; internet, on the VPN tab, tap the **VPN** connection, and then tap **Advanced options**. You can then reconfigure the VPN settings as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Your VPN connection will appear on the list of available networks when you tap the network icon in the notification area.
