Microsoft Teams is a powerful collaboration tool that helps your people  to work more efficiently.  At the same time, allowing greater collaboration and sharing of data increases the security risk. To reduce that risk, Microsoft Teams provides enterprise-grade security that can scale to meet your organization's needs.

Through the Microsoft Teams admin center you control how Teams works in your organization, from deciding who joins chats, and the apps they're allowed to run, to monitoring the content of messages to prevent sharing of sensitive information.  While many of these features and services are enabled by default, others are enabled on a case-by-case basis.

Suppose you're a senior administrator for Contoso and you're in charge of a new Teams deployment with around 3000 users. The board of directors has been concerned about an increase in denial-of-service attacks and data regulation breaches that have been making headlines recently. They've made you responsible for security enforcement and you want to ensure that Teams doesn't represent a weak point in your defenses.
