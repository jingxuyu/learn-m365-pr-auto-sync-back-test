## Explore and implement password alternatives

It would be easier for Christina, and safer for her company, if she didnâ€™t have to remember a password at all. Her company recently implemented passwordless authentication. To access her devices, she can use either her facial recognition or biometrics on her mobile phone or Windows 10 laptop for authentication.

## What is passwordless authentication

Users want to be productive and sometimes feel that security measures infringe on productivity. Passwordless authentication methods remove vulnerable passwords from the equation entirely so that users are authenticated by combining something you have (like a smart phone or badge), something you are (biometrics), or something you know (a PIN tied to a specific device).

- Removes the biggest vulnerability to the security perimeter: weak passwords that can be stolen
- Uses facial recognition and biometrics authentication to help ensure the right person has the right access
- Ties your PIN to your device so that a hacker would need to steal both
