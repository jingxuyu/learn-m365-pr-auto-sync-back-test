  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can you determine if a SharePoint Framework client-side web part is running in SharePoint Online or Microsoft Teams?"
    choices:
    - content: "You can't. Microsoft Teams renders tabs in Iframes, so the web part just knows it's loaded in the browser."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The SharePoint Framework API includes a `microsoftTeams` property on the `this.context` object that is undefined if it's running in SharePoint. If it's running in Microsoft Teams, the property is populated."
    - content: "Use the `this.context.sdks.microsoftTeams` object to determine if the web part is running in Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the `this.context.isTeams` and `this.context.isSharePoint` properties to determine if the web part is running in Microsoft Teams or SharePoint Online."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `isTeams` and `isSharePoint` properties aren't valid properties."
  - content: "Do you need to do any more steps to SharePoint client-side web parts to access Microsoft Teams related information?"
    choices:
    - content: "No, the web part has everything it needs to access properties like the current team name."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Yes, you need to import the @microsoft/teams-js package."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The @microsoft/teams-js package is included with all SPFx projects starting with v1.14."
