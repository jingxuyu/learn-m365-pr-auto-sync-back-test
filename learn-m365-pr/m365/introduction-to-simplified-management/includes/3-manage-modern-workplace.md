In the modern workplace, IT departments typically support multiple device types each of which can be configured in different ways. Android and iOS operating systems on phones and tablets, Windows 10 devices that are connected to your AD DS domain, and users’ own devices must all be supported. All these devices must conform to organizational standards of security and device health. In addition, IT pros must be able to configure the various types of devices to support organizational apps and features, such as VPNs, email settings, and updates.

Laptops, tablets or other mobile devices are the primary devices used in enterprise environments today. These devices present unique management challenges to enterprise IT departments. These challenges might include:

- **Mobile devices connecting to hostile networks.** Mobile devices frequently connect to networks outside the organization. A person’s home network might be safe, but organizational computers often connect to Wi-Fi access points in public places such as airports and cafés. Using Wi-Fi access points hackers can capture network traffic and try to insert malware into browsing sessions to compromise the computer. 

- **Mobile devices intermittently connecting to organizational networks.** Because mobile devices are not always on the organizational network, it’s difficult to manage them using tools such as Group Policy, which assume that the devices are always connected to the organizational network.

- **Backing up data.** When a device is connected to the organizational network, users are more likely to use documents in central locations such as file shares and SharePoint sites that are backed up regularly. Because mobile devices may not regularly connect and use content from central locations, data on mobile devices is more likely to be stored only on those mobile computers. This means that if a mobile computer is lost, stolen, or suffers a hardware failure, the unique copy of that organizational data is likely to be lost.

- **Mobile devices more easily lost or stolen.** The average cost of replacing a stolen device can exceed the purchase price of the device. This cost is higher because the organization must configure the new device, determine what data was on the lost or stolen devices and replace it. In some cases, that data exists only on the mobile device and is therefore lost to the organization.

- **Compromised devices connect to the internal network.** A mobile device that is infected with malware can introduce that malware into the organization. Therefore, organizations must treat mobile devices as possible malware vectors.

- **Many mobile devices run the iOS or Android operating systems.** This provides a challenge to organizational IT departments who need to balance the user’s desire to use the platform of their choice with the organization’s need to ensure that only authorized people and devices access sensitive applications and data. When considering a mobile device support policy, you must take the following questions into account:
   - Is the device owned by the user or the organization?
   - Should you permit user-owned devices to access sensitive applications and data? Or only if the owner consents to having the device managed by the IT department?
   - What actions can organizations take to protect data stored on the device if the device is lost or the user leaves the company?

Because mobile devices are more likely than larger devices such as laptops to be lost or stolen the loss can mean that gigabytes of organizational data can potentially be made public. Organizations that allow mobile devices to have access to sensitive data need to have policies in place to address what happens if the user loses or misplaces the device, or the user (who is the owner of the device) leaves the organization.
