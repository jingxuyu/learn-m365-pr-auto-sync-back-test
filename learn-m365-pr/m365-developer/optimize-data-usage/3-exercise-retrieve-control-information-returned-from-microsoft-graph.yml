  title: Limiting the size of the response
  description: Demonstrate you understand how to limit the size of the response of a Microsoft Graph request
  questions:
  - content: "Which query parameter is used to limit the results returned to a specified number?"
    choices:
    - content: "$limit"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "$limit is not a valid query parameter."
    - content: "$top"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Corect, $top returns only the specified number of results."
    - content: "$select"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "$select is not used to limit the number of results; it is used to limit the fields returned in the result set."
  - content: "Which of the following query parameter combinations would return only the email address of users with the last name 'Smith'?"
    choices:
    - content: "?$filter=equals(lastname,'Smith')&$only=Mail"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There are two problems with this option. First, $only is not a valid query parameter. Second, 'equals' is not a filter function. The filter function used to test for equality is 'eq'."
    - content: "?$filter=eq(lastname,'Smith')&$select=Mail"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Proceed to the next unit in the module."
    - content: "?$filter=(lastname = 'Smith')&$select=Mail"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The $filter query parameter syntax is incorrect. The test function to perform should be specified and expects two input parameters. The first parameter is the field to test while the second parameter is the value to use in the test."
