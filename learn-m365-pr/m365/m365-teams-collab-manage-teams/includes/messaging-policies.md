Messaging policies are used to control which chat and channel messaging features are available to users in Microsoft Teams. You can use the default policy that is created automatically or create one or more custom messaging policies for people in your organization. After you create a policy, you can assign it to a user or group of users.

By default, an org-wide policy named **Global** is created. All users in your organization are automatically assigned this messaging policy. You can either make changes to the policy or create one or more custom policies and assign users to them.

When you create a custom policy, you can make certain features available or prevent others from being available. You can then assign the policy to one or more users.

## Change or create a messaging policy for one or many users

You can easily manage messaging policies in the Teams admin center by signing in with administrator credentials.  For example, you could create a new custom policy named **Retain sent messages** and turn off the following settings:

- Owners can delete sent messages.
- Users can delete sent messages.
- Users can edit sent messages.

You could then assign the policy to the users.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete a policy if users are assigned to it. You must first assign a different policy to all affected users before deleting the original policy.

## Messaging policy settings

You can change the global messaging policy or create a new custom policy. For example, you can change settings to edit and delete sent messages or allow users to remove other users from a group chat.
