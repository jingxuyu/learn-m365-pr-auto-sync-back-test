A threat vector is a path or means by which a hacker, or “threat actor”, can gain access to a target. The target can be anything of value to the hacker. Common targets include:

 *  Computers and servers
 *  Usernames and passwords (known as account credentials)
 *  Personal information
 *  Financial information
 *  An organization’s plans for a new marketing campaign

In this module, you'll examine the types of threats vectors and their potential outcomes that organizations must deal with each day. You'll learn how various techniques are used to trick users into providing personal information – including account credentials - and how users may enable hackers to access a target by unwittingly executing malicious content.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:
