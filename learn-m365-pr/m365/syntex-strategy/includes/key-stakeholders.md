For your next step, you need Contoso Electronics' management and team members on your side. Getting buy-in from your organization's key stakeholders is necessary for implementing SharePoint Syntex. Companies thrive when all the necessary parties are aligned and aware of how they can use SharePoint Syntex to contribute to the success of their organization's content understanding processes.

Here, you will learn which stakeholders you should approach with your proposal for adopting SharePoint Syntex.  

## Executive/Leadership

"Buy-in" and _endorsement_ at the executive level ensures that all other stakeholders are invested in SharePoint Syntex and aligned on the greater goal or mission of implementing efficient content understanding processes. Leadership will already have a clear idea of what the entire company's goals and values are, allowing them to align implementing SharePoint Syntex with these more easily and clearly. And of course, much of the company looks to the executive team for direction and trusts their buy-in, making it easier to adopt and support SharePoint Syntex throughout the entire company.  

You may make your proposal to your CEO or Chief Operating Officer. With the executive team's endorsement and support, SharePoint Syntex is one major step closer to implementation. Leadership could also potentially be on a smaller scale, depending on the organization's size, such as the IT administrator.

Once your stakeholder from leadership is invested in taking advantage of SharePoint Syntex, they can begin speaking to the rest of your company about SharePoint Syntex's benefits.

## Champions

Product champions _advocate_ for a SharePoint Syntex rollout. Champions drive other stakeholders forward and help ingrain content understanding processes into your organization, making them an accepted norm.  

Your SharePoint Syntex champions need a basic understanding of how the solution works. They should be able to speak to the goals of applying it. This understanding will allow them to answer any questions or objections that may arise from other members of the organization. Change can be met with questioning, so being able to meet these questions with answers and a clear understanding is crucial.  

At Contoso Electronics, all your stakeholders should ideally be champions. Executives, project leads, knowledge admins, and model owners are close enough to the initiative that they can actively endorse rollout. However, at Contoso Electronics, the users who stand to benefit from the results of a SharePoint Syntex rollout might be the ultimate champions.  

With the leadership team onboard and champions evangelizing for SharePoint Syntex, you're ready to present your proposal to the next critical set of stakeholders: project leads.

## Project leads

Project leads are the person or team that manages the _deployment_ of SharePoint Syntex and then the launch of content understanding. They will need a solid understanding of Contoso Electronics' goal in adopting SharePoint Syntex. They will require insight into what is involved to make that happen. Project leads ensure that all the other stakeholders are identified and brought into communication channels. As the project gets underway, the project lead makes certain that identified roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. A project lead will need to be someone familiar with project management and have an all-encompassing view of your organization's structure.

Thus far, you have been acting as project lead to this point at Contoso. Once your proposal for applying SharePoint Syntex to Contoso Electronics' disorganized content libraries gets the green light, you may decide to pass the project lead baton to someone from your project management team.
