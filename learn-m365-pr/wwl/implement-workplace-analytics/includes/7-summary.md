This module examined Workplace Analytics, which provides powerful organizational analytics solutions. Workplace Analytics is generally available as an add-on to any Microsoft 365 enterprise plan.

This module explored how Workplace Analytics taps into Microsoft 365 email and calendar metadata, including to/from data, subject lines, and timestamps. You also learned how organizations can use Workplace Analytics to improve sales productivity, manager effectiveness, and space planning.

Given the nature of the analysis that it conducts, Workplace Analytics has access to potentially sensitive information about how a company operates. As such, it's essential that organizations plan for their data protection strategy and deployment. In this module, you learned that Workplace Analytics provides two major compliance roles - the Data Controller role and the Data Processor role. Your organization will take on the Data Controller role, and Microsoft will take on the Data Processor role. When personal data is involved, these roles provide a framework for understanding data protection when using Workplace Analytics, no matter where your organization is located.

This module also examined how Workplace Analytics places a premium on data privacy. It provides controls that administrators can use to configure it to be consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and company policies. Organizations can choose what data to use in Workplace Analytics, and who can see that data.

The module concluded with an examination of the prerequisites to setting up Workplace Analytics. You also learned about the steps required to configure Workplace Analytics, including who owns each step, what each task does, and its expected outcome.
