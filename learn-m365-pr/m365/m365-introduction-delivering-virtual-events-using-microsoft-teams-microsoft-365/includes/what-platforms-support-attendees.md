If an organization changes to delivering virtual events, they also need to ensure everyone involved in the event can participate.

You'd like to understand how people can run the software they need to participate in your virtual summit. You know about the web and mobile versions of Microsoft Teams, but not sure what the desktop app hardware requirements are. The event sponsor wants your IT team to confirm your organization has the correct licensing.

Here you'll learn about all the supported hardware and what licensing Microsoft 365 needs to support Microsoft Teams meetings and Live Events.

## Devices and Clients

The members of your event team and the attendees can choose to use a range of clients. For presenters, producers, and moderators a desktop client is recommended. It's possible to present from a browser or mobile device, but the Teams experience will be more limited.

For attendees along with desktops and mobiles, they might use a Teams Room device.

If you're installing the Microsoft Teams client, these are the hardware requirements.
