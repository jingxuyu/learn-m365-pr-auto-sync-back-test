Microsoft 365 Apps includes the Microsoft productivity suite of applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams for both Windows and Mac devices. Microsoft 365 Apps isn't a web-based version of Office - instead it's a full version of Office that your users install and run on their devices. You can use the Office applications that come with Microsoft 365 Apps with the on-premises or online versions of Exchange, SharePoint, or Skype for Business.

You can install Microsoft 365 Apps from a network share or directly from the internet. After it's installed, you donâ€™t have to be connected to the internet to use Microsoft 365 Apps. However, you'll need to connect at least once every 30 days to ensure your license is still active.

Microsoft 365 Apps is updated either monthly or semi-annually with new features, security updates, and other quality updates from Microsoft. You can choose which frequency works best for your organization by selecting specific update channels.
