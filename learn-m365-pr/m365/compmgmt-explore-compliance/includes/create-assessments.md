## Create scenario-specific custom assessments

The assessment templates Microsoft provides focus on Microsoft 365 and the most common industry regulations and standards. Your organization may have compliance requirements that extend beyond what Microsoft offers. With that in mind, Microsoft allows you to set up custom assessments to help ensure all your compliance needs can be met using Microsoft Compliance Manager. Here are two scenarios where you might decide to use a customized assessment template:

- To extend an existing Microsoft assessment template to add new controls.
- To create a new custom template to manage a regulation not addressed by Microsoft or specific use case in your organization.
