This module examines how to implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) in Microsoft 365. Before the introduction of MDM solutions, companies traditionally joined desktop devices to on-premises AD DS and managed them through Group Policies and Configuration Manager. But in todayâ€™s world, users are employing not only desktops, but a wide assortment of devices. Most devices are mobile, and they're used from anywhere. They're often not connected to the company network, and some of them are running non-Windows operating systems. In many cases, it's not suitable or even possible to join such devices to an on-premises AD DS.

Mobile Device Management manages all popular mobile devices without joining them to an on-premises AD DS. To manage a device with MDM, you just need to enroll it to your MDM solution. At Microsoft, that means enrolling it to either Intune or Basic Mobility and Security. After the device is enrolled to MDM, you can still manage it through group policies and profiles if you want. However, MDM provides more device management features that aren't available in on-premises AD DS, such as device compliance and conditional access.

An organization should first plan its MDM solution before deploying MDM, enrolling devices to it, and managing device compliance. This module examines the features of effective MDM planning, including the built-in capabilities of mobile device management for Microsoft 365, a comparison of Microsoft's two MDM solutions, policy settings for mobile devices, and controlling email and document access.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the two MDM authority solutions included in Microsoft 365 - Microsoft Intune and Basic Mobility and Security.
 -  Compare the basic features in Microsoft Intune and Basic Mobility and Security.
 -  Describe the policy settings for mobile devices in Microsoft Intune and Basic Mobility and Security.
 -  Explain how email and document access are controlled on devices managed by MDM.
