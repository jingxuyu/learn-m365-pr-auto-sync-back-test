Now that you've decided on the attendee experience for your event it's time to consider how to make it accessible. 

Here you'll see what you need to focus on to make your even inclusive and accessible for everyone involved.

## Plan your event for inclusivity and accessibility

You can improve how inclusive and accessible your events are by thinking about these tasks during planning:

1. Review your events team and presenters for diversity. Are you able to give the opportunity for different people to present alongside seasoned presenters?
1. Build your event team to make use of diverse perspectives across your organization.
1. Have a registration process that allows you to gather diversity information. What are peoples preferred pronouns? Do they require Sign Language translation? Do they have any extra requirements?
1. Make use of event surveys to get feedback from all involved.

As a presenter and events teams there are seven ways you can be more inclusive:

1. **Be your usual self**: Don't act differently around people who are different, just be yourself don't overreact
1. **Make sure your content is accessible**: From alternative text, to high contrast images, design for accessibility first
1. **Disability is a strength**: Having a diverse team will make the team stronger
1. **Use inclusive design principles**: Designing your content and presentation for inclusivity makes it better for everyone
1. **Accept everyone as a human first**: Treat everyone as a whole person
1. **Learn the appropriate etiquette**: Let people self-identify, and amplify what people say rather than speaking for them
1. **Follow peoples lead**: Let them ask for help don't just assume they need it

## Create inclusive communications

With your team focused on making your event engaging, inclusive, and accessible you need to look at applying this approach to your events content and communications.

### Event invitations

Consider these areas when you create the invitations and registrations:

- Avoid using only images to convey information
- All images should have alternative text
- Outlook lest you check accessibility of emails in the Review section
- Ask people if they require any accommodations
- Think about inclusive - people first language

### Social media posts

The same applies to any social media posts you make to market your event. Along with the above also consider:

- Captions for all your videos
- Audio descriptions for all multimedia

### Posters and signage

You might think of posters and digital signage only applying to in-person events. However, you might still want to publicize your event with this medium. Building on the above also think about:

- Use a large inclusive font, there is research showing a sans serif font is easier to read
- Designs should use an inclusive color contrast
- Centered text is more accessible than fully justified text

### Follow up

Once the event has finished, it's good to make all your event content available to attendees. Check that it meets all the above points. This should also apply to the attendee survey you ask people to complete.

### Video

Your event might make use of live video, pre-recorded video, or recordings of the videos presented. Consider inclusivity with:

- Live captioning, and educating people how to turn these on in the Teams software
- Caption pre-recorded videos, along with audio descriptions, in the languages of your attendees
- Include an American Sign Language or Universal Sign Language interpreter on pre-recorded videos, and on live video if possible
- If you can share presenters scripts with your Sign Language interpreter before the event
- Presenters can provide audio descriptions themselves in live videos, reducing the need to add them in post-production

### Screen sharing

For presenters who are going to share their screen, ask them to prepare their machines before presenting. Steps they can take to improve accessibility are:

1. Switch on Focus assist on Windows machines, or Do Not Disturb on Macs
1. Close all other software that isn't being demonstrated
1. Use an ethernet connection instead of a wireless connection
1. Reduce the desktop resolution to 1366x768 - this will increase the size of text and pointers
1. Slides should use less text with large clear fonts
1. Consider cleaning your desktop of shortcuts and switch to a generic or appropriate wallpaper

## Moderate your event for engagement and inclusivity

Moderators can help support presenters and attendees in your events in many ways.

### Before

- Help with technical issues for presenters or attendees
- Ask the presenter how they'd like to be introduced
- Confirm how the presenter would like Q&A and attendees interactions to be moderated

### During

- Working with the producer have welcome slides for speakers before presentations begin
- Welcome people as they join, using chat or audio
- Explain how the event is going to work, is there a separate Q&A session, or are questions taken throughout?
- Keep a list of good questions for the presenter
- Use private or public answers to Q&A
- Seed questions during the event, model the behavior you'd like to see from your attendees
- At the end, thank everyone and include information where recording and materials will be available
- Capture unanswered questions to include with post event communications

### After

- Gather together all the questions to provide to the presenter
- Coordinate post-production of videos and presentation content
- Provide links to content to all attendees if you are sharing it
- Check the events team have sent out thank you communications to presenters and attendees
- Include in the communications answers to unanswered questions and reminders to complete post event surveys
