Some specific actions might not be included which might require a more complex flow. For example, you could create a flow that requests user validation. This flow could then avoid many instances where the Security Operations Center (SOC) team would have to take actions that are no longer required.

## Creating a custom flow alert with Power Automate

To create a custom flow alert with Power Automate to remove sensitive file sharing after requesting user validation, perform the following steps:

1. Create a file policy in Microsoft Cloud App Security that includes filters that match the specifics of the sensitive files.
2. In the policy, under **Alerts**, select **Send Alerts to Power Automate** and select the Power Automate playbook to send the alert to.
