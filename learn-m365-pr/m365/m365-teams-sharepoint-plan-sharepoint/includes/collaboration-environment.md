SharePoint provides a rich collaboration environment whether used by itself in the context of an individual team site or together with Microsoft Teams. Creating a successful collaboration experience requires that you balance:

- Protecting your intellectual property.
- Enabling self-service.
- Creating a smooth user experience.

## Protecting your intellectual property

When it comes to protecting your intellectual property, we recommend a balanced approach.

A configuration that allows users to share content freely can lead to accidental sharing of confidential data. However, a user experience that is difficult to use or too restrictive can lead to users finding alternative collaboration options that circumvent your governance policies, ultimately leading to even greater risk.

By using a combination of Microsoft 365 services alongside SharePoint—depending on the sensitivity of your data—you can create a collaboration environment that's easy to use and provides the security and auditing controls that you need.

## Enable self-service

While you can choose an IT-focused model where users must request sites and provide a business justification, we recommend allowing users to create Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, and SharePoint sites as needed. You can use Data Loss Prevention and Defender for Cloud Apps to help protect your content while using expiration and renewal policies to make sure unused sites don't accumulate.

By choosing options that favor user self-service, you can minimize the impact on your IT staff while creating an easier experience for your users.

## Create a smooth user experience

Creating a smooth user experience means avoiding barriers for users that they don't understand or that they must escalate to your help desk. For example, turning external sharing off for a site might cause user confusion or frustration, whereas labeling the site and its contents as confidential and using data loss prevention policy tips and emails to educate your users on your governance policies can lead to a much smoother experience for them.

## Tools to create a safe collaboration environment

Microsoft 365 provides a variety of tools that you can use with SharePoint to create a safe collaboration environment that meets your governance needs and enables your users to work efficiently:

- **Control external sharing.** Use the SharePoint sharing controls to define which sites allow sharing with guests and whether guests need to authenticate to access shared files and folders.
- **Classify and protect information.** Data loss prevention in Microsoft 365 provides a way to classify your sites and documents, and to create a series of conditions, actions, and exceptions to govern how they're used and shared.
- **Manage devices.** Use device management to ensure your organization's information is accessed only from compliant devices and apps that you trust.
- **Review users.** Use Azure Active Directory access reviews to automate a periodic review of group and team ownership and membership.
- **Manage risk.** Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to monitor activity that you consider to be risky for your organization's data.
- **Protect against malware.** Use Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to protect against users uploading malicious files to SharePoint or Teams.
- **Monitor information.** Use reports to ensure your governance requirements are met and sensitive information is being kept secure.

As you plan for SharePoint, consider which of these tools best enable you to create the collaboration environment that you need. The module **Collaborate with files and folders in SharePoint** includes an in-depth look at how file collaboration works in SharePoint.
