To help its customers focus on breach prevention and spend less on breach recovery, Microsoft has created the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, or Microsoft Graph for short. Intelligence is essentially the collection of information gained from access to various signals across the Microsoft 365 network. Every second, hundreds of GB's worth of data is added to the Graph. This anonymized data comes from:

 -  over a hundred Microsoft data centers across the globe.
 -  threats faced by over 1 billion PCs that are updated by Windows Update each month.
 -  external data points that are collected through extensive research and partnership with industry and law enforcement. This research is accomplished through Microsoft’s Digital Crime Unit and Cybersecurity Defense Operations Center.

Threat intelligence in Microsoft 365 is powered by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, which:

 -  consumes billions of signals ("signals" is a term meaning information traffic) across the Microsoft 365 network.
 -  uses artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.
 -  integrates this data across different security products to address different attack scenarios.

The signals that are obtained from the Intelligent Security Graph, plus other third-party feeds, are fed into Microsoft’s three major platforms: Windows, Azure, and Microsoft 365. Microsoft then integrates these signals so that security services in one platform can communicate with security services in one of the other platforms.

As a result, any threat seen in Windows is automatically and quickly added to the set of threats that Microsoft 365 views. This design provides deep insight into the evolving cyber threat landscape.
