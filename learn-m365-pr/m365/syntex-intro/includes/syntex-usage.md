You now know that there are two main tools that make up SharePoint Syntex – document understanding models and form processing models. Now you need to understand when to use the models.

Think back to Contoso Electronics’ challenges managing large volumes of data with approaching quarterly accounting deadlines. Syntex offers several key benefits to organize data from different document types, using both document understanding models and form processing models.

Let’s look at some common scenarios for when to use, and when not to use, Syntex.

## SharePoint Syntex use cases

### Automate business processes

Both document understanding models and form processing models take what was manual and turn it into something automated and streamlined for your business.  

With document understanding models, unstructured documents, like the sales letters generated by your company, are understood and processed. AI in the model identifies and classifies the information that you train it to so that you can optimize your SharePoint document library for what’s most crucial for document understanding.

Form processing models focus on structured and semi-structured documents, like applications and contracts, allowing you to leverage AI Builder to capture the necessary information from these structured content types. At Contoso Electronics, form processing will be particularly helpful for contracts, purchase orders, invoices, and billing statements that need to be processed in time for the accounting quarterly deadline.

While the content types are different, the focus of both models is to identify and extract the information that matters most to your business and its processes. In doing so, your organization can create more organized and efficient processes for how it handles this information, what it learns from it, and what it does with it.  

### Manage compliance risk

Maintaining compliance and data governance is particularly critical today. Your customers and clients need to trust that the data and information your business is capturing is being used in a secure and thoughtful way. Having a full, clear view into your content landscape is essential to achieve this. Knowing exactly where information is taken from and what categories it is apart sets your business up for compliance success.

As Contoso Electronics approaches its quarterly deadline, only a certain set of content and the data within it should be applicable to the numbers and information pulled by the accounting team. Proper classification and retention of this data is critical.

## When SharePoint Syntex does not apply

### Consider the content type and information

Syntex should not be considered the end-all to your content understanding. While document understanding and form processing models make it much more efficient to quickly get the information you need, certain documents should still be reviewed more closely. For example, loan applications can be easily processed and classified with Syntex, and the most essential information and metadata can be extracted immediately for easier viewing, but a deeper review of the applications may still be necessary for determining next steps in the application process.
