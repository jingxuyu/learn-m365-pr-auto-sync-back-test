There are two types of Exchange hybrid topologies, Classic hybrid and Modern hybrid.

## Classic hybrid

An Exchange Classic hybrid topology connects your on-premises Exchange environment with your Exchange Online environment in the cloud. A Classic deployment provides the full Exchange Hybrid experience but requires you to configure Exchange Client Access and Transport connections to and from the internet.

There are many steps and considerations when configuring a Classic hybrid deployment. For more information, you should go to the Exchange Server hybrid deployments website from the Learn more section.

## Modern hybrid

An Exchange Modern hybrid topology provides Free/Busy sharing, mailbox migrations, mail flow, and directory synchronization. To configure an Exchange Modern hybrid topology, you use the Hybrid Agent.

The Hybrid Agent removes some of the challenges you might face when you configure an Exchange Hybrid environment. The agent, which is built on the same technology as the Azure Application Proxy, removes some requirements for external DNS entries, certificate updates and inbound network connections through your firewall, to enable Exchange hybrid features. To see how to configure a Modern hybrid topology, go to the Microsoft Hybrid Agent website from the Learn more section.
