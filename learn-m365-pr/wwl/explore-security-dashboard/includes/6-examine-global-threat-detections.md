The Security Dashboard includes a view of the daily threat detections around the globe. Like the **Weekly threat detections** tile at the top of the dashboard, this **Global weekly threat detections** tile shows the number of messages and threats across the entire Microsoft 365 network that were scanned, stopped, blocked, and removed.

Next to **Global weekly threat detections** is a heat-map that shows where attacks targeting your tenant originated.

The **Top targeted users** tile gives you quick insight into who is being targeted in your organization. Itâ€™s also another launch point for investigating threats in your tenant. Selecting a user opens a flyout page where you can learn more details about the user, such as:

 -  The location and time of their last sign-in attempt.
 -  Their membership in an any administrative group.
 -  A brief snapshot of their activities in Microsoft 365.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Threat intelligence features in Microsoft 365 are frequently updated to include more capabilities and features. As a result, the menu options under Threat management and other components in the user interface may change over time.
