A **service request** creates a support case that formalizes a request to Microsoft Support for help. You can create  requests through different channels including telephone support, online chat support, and email. Each customer case is identified by a unique code that helps track the request through the support process until the issue is resolved and the case is closed. You can reopen a case using the same number in a new request call, but only if it’s for the exact same problem or error. Each service request should be about a specific issue or error message that you include when you file the request for the first time. Bundling more than one issue into a request causes issues when support engineers need to build a history of what’s happened in your environment and causes problems for tracking larger issues. Bundling also hides trends that may be affecting an entire product.

## Creating a service request
You can create a new service request in the Microsoft 365 admin center and view the status of any existing requests. As shown in the following image, first toggle off the O365 Assistant bot in the Support pane, and then type in a description of your issue, and search for solutions. If your problem hasn’t been resolved, create a new service request by phone or by email.

## Viewing existing service requests
You can view the status of all your existing service requests. Either click **View service requests** under the Support blade, or if you already have the help pane open, click the circular arrow icon in the **Need help** tab to display a list of your service requests.
