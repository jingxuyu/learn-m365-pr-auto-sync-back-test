After Broad deployment, the cycle is almost complete. As the process manager, youâ€™ll propose how Woodgrove can ensure its environment is positioned better for the next update, and that it can deploy updates more efficiently.

## Capture learnings

Woodgrove should think about how it can improve the servicing process for the next deployment cycle. This procedure will help the organization minimize cost, effort and the time involved when deploying updates. 

To improve the deployment process, Woodgrove can use its learnings from the current deployment cycle and apply them in future. You do this by noting any issues in the deployment process as they arise, and investigating how they can be resolved. Woodgrove will use the outputs created at the end of the Broad deployment process to identify the best tools and ways to resolve issues. Your company can then map tools, resources, and solutions against the issues identified during the process. For example:

|Workstream  |Issue  |Solution  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Compatibility     |Manual testing takes longer than anticipated|Woodgrove can use automated testing wherever possible to reduce the time it takes to carry out tests|
|Deployment     |Deferring the update for some devices requires much manual work and tracking|Windows Update for Business can make it easier to defer updates across many devices |
|Capability and modernization     |Difficult to add new devices to the production environment by creating and customizing images|Woodgrove can use Windows Autopilot to configure new devices in a much more simplified way|
