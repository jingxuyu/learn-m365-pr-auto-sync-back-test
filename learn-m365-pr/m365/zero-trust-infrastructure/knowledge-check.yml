  questions:
  - content: SIEM and SOAR are key technologies that organizations deploy to monitor infrastructure. How do SIEM and SOAR function?
    choices:
    - content: SIEM generates alerts of a potential threat. SOAR integrates SIEM and other security tools, triggers alerts, and takes remediation steps.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. Both SOAR and SIEM platforms collect security data, evaluate threats and trigger alerts. However, SIEM doesn't address the process required for incident response.
    - content: SIEM focuses on automation whereas SOAR requires more human intervention to complete the tasks.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. SIEM requires human resources to handle security events whereas SOAR leverages artificial intelligence to automate threat detection, investigation, and incident response. SOAR works with both automated and manual processes.
    - content: SIEM and SOAR platforms can't work independently and rely on each other to monitor security events.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Although SIEM doesn't address the process required for incident response, both platforms can work independently and be used together for overall security operations.
  - content: What is the goal of configuration management?
    choices:
    - content: Effective configuration management enables organizations to accept default configurations and settings.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Default configurations are often misconfigured. Configuration management helps to disable default configurations and settings.
    - content: Configuration management implements clear screen and clear desk policies.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Enforcing clear screen and clear desk policies isn't a part of the configuration management process.
    - content: Configuration management ensures every device and endpoint is operating at optimal performance.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. Configuration management implements various tools and strategies to ensure the optimal health of your infrastructure.
  - content: Why is distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) a threat vector associated with IT infrastructure?
    choices:
    - content: A DDoS is a threat vector because it exhausts an application's resources with an overflow of internet traffic.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. A DDoS attack targets web servers or networks and tries to exhaust an application's resources with a flood of internet traffic.
    - content: A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to gain unauthorized access to sites or facilities.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Gaining unauthorized access to sites and workspaces is a security threat associated with _physical_ infrastructure.
    - content: A DDoS is a process of assessing and monitoring IT infrastructure to identify various threat vectors.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. A DDoS isn't a process, it's an attack that targets web servers or networks.
