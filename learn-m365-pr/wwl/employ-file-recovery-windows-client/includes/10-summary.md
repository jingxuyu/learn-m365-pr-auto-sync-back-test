While tools like OneDrive provide a sufficient solution for protecting files against data loss for most end user scenarios, sometimes alternative solutions are needed. You can use local solutions such as File History, which provides a simple interface for restoring files or reverting to previous versions. Using the Backup and Restore can be useful if the entire client needs to be backed up. Using a solution that uses remote or cloud-based storage is usually recommended, as these solutions are typically more robust. Azure backup provides a cloud-based solution for protecting data across a wide range of workloads.
