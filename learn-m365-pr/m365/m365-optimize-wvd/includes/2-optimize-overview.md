## Configure user profile separation and roaming 

You can use **FSLogix profiles** to separate user profiles from virtual machines, persist these profiles as user-assigned virtual disks in Azure storage, Azure NetApp Files, and Storage Spaces Direct, and then dynamically attach them to a user. Each time the user signs in to a remote resource, their profile is attached to the resource, and they're able to access all of their data.  

Compared to classic roaming user profiles in Windows, separating the user profiles and data enables a seamless roaming experience for apps that rely on %localappdata% locations, like Outlook and OneDrive. It's fast and stateful - as far as users can tell, their data loads as fast as locally stored data. FSLogix profiles let you use cached mailboxes for local-like access to email and OneDrive Files on Demand. 

Create a storage account in the Azure portal to store the user-assigned virtual disk files generated by the FSLogix profiles. The process works by containerizing the user profile into a VHD or VHDX file the first time a user signs in. The VHD or VHDX files are stored to this location and attached to users in subsequent logins.
