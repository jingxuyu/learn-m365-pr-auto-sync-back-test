  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is implementing Co-management for the company's Windows 10 devices. Holly has defined which devices will be part of Contoso's Pilot collection. Holly is considering whether to set the Workloads setting for Compliance policies to both Configuration Manager and Intune. Based on this setting, which service will manage Compliance policies on the devices that aren't in the Pilot collection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Intune"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This service won't manage Compliance policies on the devices that aren't in the Pilot collection. Try again."
    - content: "Configuration Manager"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Each of the four workloads can be managed by Configuration Manager, Intune, or both. If a workload is managed by both Configuration Manager and Intune, then Intune manages it for devices in the pilot collection, and Configuration Manager manages it for all other devices."
    - content: "The two services will co-manage the devices that aren't in the Pilot collection for the Compliance policies workload"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The two services won't co-manage Compliance policies on the devices that aren't in the Pilot collection. Try again."
