Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 help you get work done - with others and on your own - wherever you are. As long as you can connect to the internet, you can connect to the files and people you need to stay productive. Teams and Office have advanced security features built in so you can relax knowing your info is backed by enterprise-grade security.

Suppose something's happened, and you can't make it into the office - perhaps you sprained your knee or your work had to temporarily close. There's still work to be done. This module will help you learn how you can use the services available in Microsoft 365 to stay productive, no matter where you're working.
