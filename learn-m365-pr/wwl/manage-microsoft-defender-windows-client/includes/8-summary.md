The Windows Security Center in Windows clients is intended to provide a suite of security features for users to manage. These include tools such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Windows Defender Firewall. In organizations, these features should be managed centrally to ensure they're correctly configured. While the default settings include rules for common protections, Administrators should be using policies to configure security settings according to the organization's infrastructure and security policies. Security settings can be done using common management tools such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager or Group Policy.
