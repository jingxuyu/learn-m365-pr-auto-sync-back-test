  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is trying to determine how Exchange Server determines which routing path to use for message delivery at Contoso. The company's least-cost route includes multiple Active Directory sites. Which of the following scenarios describes how Exchange Server determines the AD site to use for delivery on the least-cost route?"
    choices:
    - content: "Message delivery hops through each site"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If the least-cost route includes multiple Active Directory sites, message delivery doesn't hop through each site."
    - content: "Other Active Directory sites on the least-cost path are only used if there's a delivery error"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After the least-cost route for message delivery has been selected, the Transport service in the source delivery group attempts to deliver the message directly to the destination delivery group. If the least-cost route includes multiple Active Directory sites, other Active Directory sites on the least-cost path are only used if there's a delivery error or the organization configured a modification."
    - content: "Delivery groups can't span multiple Active Directory sites"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Delivery groups can span multiple Active Directory sites. For example, a DAG can have members in multiple sites."
