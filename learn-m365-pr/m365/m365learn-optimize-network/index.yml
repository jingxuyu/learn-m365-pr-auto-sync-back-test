title: Optimize your network for Microsoft 365
summary: >
  Optimizing network traffic to on-premises datacenters is very different than optimizing for Internet traffic. To get the best performance for on-premises users of Microsoft 365, you need to modify your network to remove intermediate and unneeded paths, destinations, and packet processing.
