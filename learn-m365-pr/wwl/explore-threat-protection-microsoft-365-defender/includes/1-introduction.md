Exchange Online Protection (EOP) uses a multi-layered approach to protect users from different kinds of threats, such as:

 -  Phishing
 -  Spoofing
 -  Spam
 -  Bulk email
 -  Malware

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 extends the protection provided by EOP by filtering targeted attacks that could pass through EOPâ€™s line of defenses. These attacks include advanced threats such as:

 -  Zero-day attacks in email attachments and Office documents.
 -  Time-of-click protection against malicious URLs.

When integrated together, EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provide the most efficient level of protection against commodity and advanced targeted threats.

This module examines how Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protects users from advanced threats through features such as safe attachments and safe links. You'll also learn about Configuration Analyzer, which reviews an organization's threat protection policies and provides suggestions for improvement. The module then explores how to manage spoof intelligence features and anti-phishing policies.
