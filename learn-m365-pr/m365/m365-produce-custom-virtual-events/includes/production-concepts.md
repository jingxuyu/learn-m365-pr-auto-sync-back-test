## Production Concepts
Before you start designing your event, it’s helpful to understand the high-level components that make for a successful custom event.
## High level process flow
Production with an external app or encoder requires multiple components:
- Skilled production staff : Advanced productions often require technical producers alongside communications and on-air talent staff.  
- A scheduled live event for production and attendee experiences.  
- An external app/encoder (such as OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS, Wirecast, vMix).  
- An active source of content ingested into the external app/encoder.

You can use content from a variety of sources for your virtual event; in this module, we’ll use a Teams meeting as the source of content provided to OBS Studio, the external app/encoder.
## Produce your broadcast from a secure, virtual stage
This graphic shows how you can take your content (in this case a Teams meeting) and broadcast it for your event.

**Source**:The content source comes from a Teams meeting, which is your secure, virtual stage. The producer joins the Teams meeting and uses NDI to extract the video feeds and mixed audio feed.  

**Customized Broadcast**: The Producer uses production software (OBS, Wirecast, vMix)  to create the layouts you want for your event. You can stream your custom event from the production software to your audience in various locations, including third party platforms like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook
