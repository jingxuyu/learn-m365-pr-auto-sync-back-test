# Microsoft Learn - Microsoft 365 training content

This repository contains the Learn modules and learning paths for Microsoft 365. Review this README file to understand how you can assist in contributing to Microsoft Learn training content.

## Other repos for Microsoft Learn training

* **Content repos:** To view the list of all content repos, see [GitHub repositories for Microsoft Learn training](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/repos-msft-learn).
* **Code repos:** Code repos for individual modules follow the naming convention of `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-module-name`. To find them all, search in GitHub for all repos in the MicrosoftDocs GitHub organization that start with `mslearn-`.

## Content author and learner experience

The content in Learn repos is developed, organized, and displayed differently than traditional Docs content.

* **Development**: Modules and learning paths are highly curated training content with textual content, hands-on interactivity, live knowledge checks, videos, achievements and more. The Learn content team, in partnership with other content teams, governs the roadmap and quality of content before publishing, for all products. These training assets are made up of YAML and MD files, in specific folder structures.
* **Organization**: Learn repos are typically created for each product family rather than per-product. The content in these repos are aggregated together for the final experience (i.e. the files interact with each other, so you could include Azure and Business Applications content into a single learning path, if you need).
* **Display**: Although there may be separate landing pages for various product families, there is a single, all-up Microsoft Learn training home page, as well as a dynamic browse page that shows all Learn content side-by-side, regardless of product.

### Home, landing, and browse pages

* [Microsoft Learn training home page](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/)
* [Browse all Microsoft Learn training resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/browse/)

To view all of the available landing pages, you can navigate to them from the header of the home page.

At this time, Microsoft Learn training content is not open for public contributions. External users can provide feedback by clicking on the **Report an issue** email alias located at the bottom of any learning unit. The English alias is `learn-en-us@microsoft.com`. If the user is viewing the site in any other language, they will be able to access the localized versions of the alias. Although this is one-way feedback, the content, engineering, and localization teams review and triage all incoming feedback on a daily basis.
