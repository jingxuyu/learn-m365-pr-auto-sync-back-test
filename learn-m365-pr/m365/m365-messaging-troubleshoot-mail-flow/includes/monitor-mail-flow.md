Exchange Online and Microsoft 365 include reports to help you monitor mail flow.

## Reports included in the Microsoft 365 admin center

You can access the following reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

- **Usage reports** include information about:
  - Microsoft 365 and Office 365 groups
  - The number of messages sent
  - The email apps that connected to Exchange Online
  - Storage used, quota consumption, item count, and last activity (send or read activity) for mailboxes
- **Security & compliance reports** provide an interactive reporting experience for Exchange Online admins, including summary information and access to detailed information.

## Custom reports

In addition to these reports, you can create custom reports by using Microsoft Graph or reporting web services.

### Create a custom report by using Microsoft Graph

You can use Microsoft Graph to programmatically create the reports that are available in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the data in Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.

See **Learn more** for an overview of Microsoft Graph.

### Create a custom report by using reporting web services

You can create reports from the available Exchange Online PowerShell reporting cmdlets by using REST/ODATA2 query filtering.
