Microsoft recommends sending mail or using your business's preferred communication method to tell the people about their new phone numbers.

In **Microsoft Teams**, users can see their phone number by selecting **Calls** in the left navigation. The phone number is shown above the dial pad.

### Do you want to automate assigning phone numbers?

If you know Windows PowerShell, you can use the following cmdlets to automate assigning phone numbers to your users.

Retrieves the telephone numbers from the Business Voice Directory.

```powershell
Get-CsOnlineTelephoneNumber
```

Sets the telephone numbers.

```powershell
Set-CsOnlineVoiceUser
```

For more information, see **Microsoft Teams PowerShell Overview** in the **Additional resources** section in the Summary.
