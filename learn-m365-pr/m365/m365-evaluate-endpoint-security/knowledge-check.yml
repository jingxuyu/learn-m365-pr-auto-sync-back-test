  questions:
  - content: "How do you run a simulation from the simulation gallery?"
    choices:
    - content: "Pick a simulation from the gallery, select Run, choose a device, then select Create simulation."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This way, you can run a simulation directly from the gallery."
    - content: "Pick a simulation from the gallery, select Update new simulation, choose a device, then select Create simulation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Update new simulation isn't a valid option."
    - content: "Pick a simulation from the gallery, select Run, choose a device, then select Update new simulation."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Update new simulation isn't a valid option."
  - content: "What are the two types of attack simulation scenarios that you can use in the evaluation lab?"
    choices:
    - content: "Threat simulator scenarios, Real-threat scenarios"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "'Real-threat scenarios' isn't a valid scenario type in the evaluation lab."
    - content: "Threat simulator scenarios, Do-It-Yourself scenarios"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "You can use either type to help you to evaluate capabilities."
    - content: "Do-It-Yourself scenarios, Self-correcting scenarios "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "'Self-correcting scenarios' isn't a valid scenario type in the evaluation lab."
  - content: "How will you find the simulation gallery in the portal?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the navigation pane, select Updated gallery > Tutorials & simulations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Updated gallery isn't a valid option in the navigation pane."
    - content: "In the navigation pane, select Evaluation & tutorials > New gallery"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "New gallery isn't a valid option in the navigation pane."
    - content: "Select Evaluation & tutorials > Tutorials & simulations"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Use the simulation gallery to find and run simulations from Microsoft and industry-leading partners."
