The Enterprise Desktop Support Technician (EDST) is to act as an escalation point for problems that help-desk personnel can't resolve. It also must support end users directly, and troubleshoot problems. However, an EDSTâ€™s responsibilities involve much more than simply fixing problems. Desktop Administrators will frequently work directly with the EDST. Depending on the size of the organization, the Administrator might also perform the EDST duties.

The goal of this module is to introduce you to the EDST role and describe how an EDST best supports end users, both directly and indirectly, in a Windows client environment.
