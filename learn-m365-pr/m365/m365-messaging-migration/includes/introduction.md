It's recommended that you use an Exchange hybrid environment to migrate mailboxes from Exchange on-premises to Microsoft 365, but there are many other methods. The migration method you choose depends on the source system, the number of mailboxes you have, and other details.

Suppose you work for a clothing retail company. You have an on-premises Exchange 2013 system with around 2,000 mailboxes. Because you have recently merged with a smaller competitor, you also have mailboxes in a non-Microsoft IMAP4 mail server. You want to migrate all these mailboxes to Microsoft 365 over the next few months, and you'll begin by creating a project plan. You want to understand the best migration methods to use for both systems.
