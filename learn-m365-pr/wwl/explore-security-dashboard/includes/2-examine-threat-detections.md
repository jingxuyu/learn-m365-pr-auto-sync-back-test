The Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center enables your organization to manage data protection and compliance. A key tool within the Security and Compliance Center is the Security Dashboard. The dashboard enables you to review your organization's Threat Protection Status and view and act on security alerts.

To launch the Security Dashboard, go to the Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center, and then in the left navigation pane, go to **Threat management &gt; Dashboard**.

The Security Dashboard includes tiles you can select to provide summarized and detailed information on your organization's threat protection status. These tiles provide a quick view into the top malware families targeting your tenant and how Microsoft 365 is protecting your tenant.

Depending on what your organization's subscription includes, the Security Dashboard includes tiles such as Threat Management Summary, Threat Protection Status, Global Weekly Threat Detections, Malware, and more, as described in the following sections.

### Threat Management Summary

The Threat Management Summary tile tells you at a glance how your organization was protected from threats over the past seven days.
