As you plan your Microsoft 365 deployment, you're concerned about potential network issues that may occur when you migrate Northwind's mailboxes to Microsoft 365. Your initial concern is the amount of time it will take to complete the mailbox migration. You want a fast migration, but you're concerned with the time it may take to complete the data transfer.
