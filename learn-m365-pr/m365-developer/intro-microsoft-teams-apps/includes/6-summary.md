Nice work! You should now have a solid understanding of what an app for Microsoft Teams is, what extensibility points and UI elements are available to you on the Microsoft Teams Platform, and how to build and distribute your app. Remember:

* Microsoft Teams isn't a hosting platform; you'll need to host the web services that power your Teams app yourself.
* Choosing the right extensibility points and UI elements is key to creating a successful app.
* You can distribute your app for a few select users or teams, an entire organization, or on our public app store.
