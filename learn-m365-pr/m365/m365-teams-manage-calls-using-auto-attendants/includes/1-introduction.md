Microsoft Teams Phone System allows you to replace your private branch exchange (PBX) system with a cloud-integrated solution. This includes common PBX functionality, such as the ability to present a menu of options and the ability to manage a queue of callers.

Suppose you're a Microsoft Teams administrator for a large organization that sells digital cameras. With the successful deployment of Teams across your organization, you've provided Teams channels, chats, and improved collaboration. Customers call your company for technical support on their equipment. You want to gather information about their issues with a menu and queue calls during busy times.

In this module, you'll learn how auto attendants and call queues in Microsoft Teams can interact with callers and ensure they're connected to one of your agents as quickly as possible. You'll also learn how to set up auto attendants and call queues.
