This module explains the role of device drivers in Windows. Windows generally handles the process of identifying and installing the correct driver automatically, however there's sometimes a need to install drivers manually. Device Manager can be used to identify and troubleshoot driver issues.

For most hardware, once the driver is installed, no other administrative effort is needed unless the hardware fails. Printers are the exception to this, as they often require additional considerations, especially network and shared printers. While v4 print drivers have largely simplified the driver process in printers, administrators may need to choose printer drivers depending on the scenario. You also learned about the Print Management Console, which can be used to remotely manage print queues and print servers.
