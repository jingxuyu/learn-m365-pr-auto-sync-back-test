Malicious software, or malware, is software that attackers design to harm computer systems. Malware can do many things, from causing damage to the computer, to allowing unauthorized parties remote access to the computer, to collecting and transmitting sensitive information to unauthorized third parties. There are several types of malware, including:

 -  **Computer viruses**. This type of malware replicates by inserting a copy of its executable code into other applications, operating-system files, data files, or hardware components, such as the BIOS or boot sector files.
 -  **Computer worms**. Worms are a special form of malware that replicate without direct intervention. Worms spread across networks and can infect other computers on a network, without requiring a user to open an email attachment or file.
 -  **Trojan horses**. This type of malware provides an attacker with remote access to the infected computer.
 -  **Ransomware**. This type of malware encrypts user data, and you can recover your data only if you pay a ransom to the malware authors.
 -  **Spyware**. This type of malware tracks how a computer is used without the userâ€™s consent.
