Windows 10 Enterprise E3 launched in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channel on September 1, 2016. With the release of Windows 11, Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP is also available. Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP delivers, by subscription, exclusive features reserved for Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise editions. This offering is available through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channel with the Partner Center as an online service.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP provides a flexible, per-user subscription for small- and medium-sized organizations (from one to hundreds of users).

To take advantage of this offering, an organization must satisfy the following requirements:

 -  The devices to be upgraded must have either of the following operating systems installed and activated: Windows 10 Pro, version 1607 (Windows 10 Anniversary Update) or later, or Windows 11.
 -  Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must be available for identity management.

Organizations can move from Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 11 Enterprise more easily than ever before — with no keys, and no reboots. After a user in an organization enters the Azure AD credentials associated with a Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 license, the operating system turns from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 11 Pro to Windows 11 Enterprise, and all the appropriate Enterprise features are unlocked. When a subscription license expires or is transferred to another user, the Enterprise device seamlessly steps back down to Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro.

Previously, only organizations with a Microsoft Volume Licensing Agreement could deploy Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 11 Enterprise to their users. Now, with Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP, small- and medium-sized organizations can more easily take advantage of Enterprise edition features.

When an organization purchases Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 through a partner, it receives the following benefits:

 -  **Windows 10/11 Enterprise edition**. Devices currently running Windows 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro can get Windows 10/11 Enterprise Current Branch (CB) or Current Branch for Business (CBB). This benefit doesn't include Long Term Service Branch (LTSB).
 -  **Support from one user to hundreds of users**. Although the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP program doesn't have a limitation on the number of licenses an organization can have, the program is designed for small- and medium-sized organizations.
 -  **Deploy on up to five devices**. For each user covered by the license, an organization can deploy Windows 10/11 Enterprise edition on up to five devices.
 -  **Roll back to Windows 10/11 Pro at any time**. When a user’s subscription expires or is transferred to another user, the Windows 10/11 Enterprise device reverts seamlessly to Windows 10/11 Pro edition (after a grace period of up to 90 days).
 -  **Monthly, per-user pricing model**. This pricing model makes Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 affordable for any organization.
 -  **Move licenses between users**. Licenses can be quickly and easily reallocated from one user to another user, allowing organizations to optimize their licensing investments against changing needs.

How does the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP program compare with Microsoft Volume Licensing Agreements and Software Assurance?

 -  [Microsoft Volume Licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default.aspx?azure-portal=true) programs are broader in scope, providing organizations with access to licensing for all Microsoft products.
 -  [Software Assurance](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/licensing-programs/software-assurance-default.aspx?azure-portal=true) provides organizations with the following categories of benefits:
    
    
     -  **Deployment and management**. These benefits include planning services, Microsoft Desktop Optimization (MDOP), Windows Virtual Desktop Access Rights, Windows-To-Go Rights, Windows Roaming Use Rights, Windows Thin PC, Windows RT Companion VDA Rights, and other benefits.
     -  **Training**. These benefits include training vouchers, online e-learning, and a home use program.
     -  **Support**. These benefits include 24x7 problem resolution support, backup capabilities for disaster recovery, System Center Global Service Monitor, and a passive secondary instance of SQL Server.
     -  **Specialized**. These benefits include step-up licensing availability (which enables you to migrate software from an earlier edition to a higher-level edition) and to spread license and Software Assurance payments across three equal, annual sums.
    
    In addition, in Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP, a partner can manage an organization's licenses for it. With Software Assurance, organizations manage their own licenses.

In summary, the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 in CSP program is an upgrade offering that provides small- and medium-sized organizations easier, more flexible access to the benefits of Windows 10/11 Enterprise edition. In contrast, Microsoft Volume Licensing programs and Software Assurance are broader in scope and provide benefits beyond access to the Enterprise edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11.
