In this module, you learned how Microsoft Defender for Identity helps address the security needs of organizations. Defender for Identity is a cloud-based security solution. It uses an organization's on-premises Active Directory information to identify, detect, and analyze potential threats, compromised accounts, and malicious insider actions inside the organization. Defender for Identity monitors not just user accounts, but all devices in an organization's network that conduct authentication and authorization requests against Active Directory, including non-Windows and mobile devices. Besides analyzing an organization's Active Directory traffic using deep packet inspection technology, Defender for Identity also collects relevant Windows Events from the organization's domain controller and creates entity profiles based on information from Active Directory Domain Services.

Microsoft Defender for Identity replaces Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA). For organizations that had previously implemented ATA, it's recommended that you transition to Microsoft Defender for Identity.

This module showed you how to create your Microsoft Defender for Identity instance, which is required to implement Defender for Identity.

You also learned how Microsoft Defender for Identity monitors users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics. The Microsoft Defender for identity portal is used to monitor and respond to detected suspicious activity. The portal provides a quick view of all suspicious activity in chronological order. It allows administrators to filter out specific details of any activity and gives actions based on those activities. The Defender for Identity portal also shows alerts and notifications that highlight problems detected by the service.
