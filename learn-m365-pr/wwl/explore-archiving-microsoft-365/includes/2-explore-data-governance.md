The amount of data that organizations around the world are required to manage and care for is staggering. On average, companies are experiencing a 50% year-over-year growth of electronic data. When you factor in the entire body of information they're already expanding upon, the total amount of information they're managing doubles every 18 months.

Managing such a large volume of data can be challenging, especially in today’s information age when the data isn't just email; it's documents, video files, instant messaging, and so on. And when you add in the fact that many companies don't even know what data they have, where their data is located, or what it’s doing, it’s no surprise that they struggle managing the liability and risk associated with data governance and compliance.

Common questions asked by organizations when faced with challenges of data governance and compliance include:

 -  How should we manage all this data when it's scattered across the enterprise or organization, and all the while it continues to grow exponentially?
 -  How can we apply business policies universally across the organization and across multiple business solutions?
 -  Is there a way of implementing business policies so that user productivity isn't disrupted?
 -  Can we make data governance something that’s automatic so that we don’t have to dedicate someone to manage it each day?
 -  How do we protect sensitive information, such as health care records and financial information?
 -  How do we find relevant data when we really need it?

To address these concerns, Microsoft 365 provides state-of-the-art compliance solutions that target the three core aspects that every organization generally requires:

 -  Preserving vital data.
 -  Finding the data that you've preserved and understanding what's there.
 -  Auditing, reporting, and monitoring business activity to ensure that users are abiding by business policy rules, business processes, and industry regulations.

The compliance solution provided by Microsoft 365 is built upon three core pillars:

 -  **Data governance.** Making sure that users have the tools available to import, store, preserve, retire, and expire data as it leaves an organization’s data retention windows.
 -  **eDiscovery.** Finding information quickly and ensuring that it's relevant to the request that was made.
 -  **Auditing.** Enabling organizations to monitor and investigate all the actions taken within the compliance solution and on their data to ensure that nothing outside the norm is happening.

These three core features of Microsoft 365's compliance solution are built into the Security and Compliance Center (SCC). This secure, easy-to-use portal enables admins and security officers to go directly to the SCC and manage all that information across Microsoft 365 from one specific location. Within the data governance pillar, the Security and Compliance Center provides the following core capabilities that allow organizations to manage their data:

 -  **Import.** Microsoft 365 includes an import service that enables organizations to import data into a single repository within their Microsoft 365 environment. Different methodologies are available for organizations to import data into Microsoft 365, including:
    
     -  **Drive shipping.** An organization can mail hard drives with terabytes and terabytes of information to Microsoft, who then loads it in a fashion that's timely and cost effective.
     -  **Self-service network upload.** This methodology, which is used for one-time imports and for lower volumes of information, enables organizations to send their data over the wire and load it directly into the Microsoft 365 import service.
     -  **Third-party data ingestion.** Organizations can use partners to import their data into Microsoft 365 from third-party sources such as Facebook, Bloomberg, and Twitter. This capability provides cross-platform compliance and governance.
 -  **Retention policies.** Microsoft 365 provides unified retention and disposition policies for data workloads. This capability enables an organization to analyze its business processes, business rules, and business requirements, create a policy that matches these features, and then add the policy directly to its datasets.
 -  **Records management.** Microsoft 365 enables organizations to classify end users in Outlook, SharePoint, OneDrive for Business, and Groups. Microsoft 365 also includes automatic, event-triggered records management that is supported by manual review and disposition, deep reporting, and permission management, so that you can control who has access to those records.
 -  **SEC 17A-4 compliance.** US customers in the financial industry must adhere to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule 17A-4, which is a regulation that outlines requirements for data retention, indexing, and accessibility for companies that deal in the trade or brokering of financial securities.
