People in your organization collaborate with others both inside and outside the organization. This means that content no longer stays behind a firewall â€“ it roams everywhere, across devices, apps, and services. And when it roams, you want it to do so in a way that meets your organization's business and compliance policies.

In this module, you'll learn how you can classify and help protect your sensitive content by using sensitivity labels. With sensitivity labels, you can classify data across your organization and enforce protection settings based on that classification. Once a user assigns sensitivity label to an email or document, the protection settings for that label are enforced on the content.
