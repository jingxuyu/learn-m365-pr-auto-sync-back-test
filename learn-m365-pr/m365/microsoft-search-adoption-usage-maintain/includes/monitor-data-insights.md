Search insights include reports and data for:

   | Report                            | Description |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | **Query volume**                  | The total number of search queries performed. Use to determine periods of high and low search activity. Low volume may indicate a lack of user awareness of Microsoft Search or search entry points. |
   | **Top queries**                   | The most popular search queries in your organization. Use to understand the types of information your users are searching for. |
   | **No results queries**            | Popular search queries that returned no results and might create user dissatisfaction. Use to identify potential content gaps or improve discoverability of existing content. |
   | **Abandoned queries**             | The most popular search queries with low click-through. Use to identify potential content gaps or adjust keywords and settings of existing content. |
