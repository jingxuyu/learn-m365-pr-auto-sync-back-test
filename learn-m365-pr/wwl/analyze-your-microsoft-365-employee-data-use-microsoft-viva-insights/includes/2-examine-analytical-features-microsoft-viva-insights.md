### Data sources

Microsoft Viva Insights processes collaboration data from Microsoft 365. It then maps descriptive employee attributes, usually from the organization's human resource information system (HRIS) with the collaboration data. The following graphic displays this process:

:::image type="content" source="../media/data-sources-flowpath-8a0df74f.png" alt-text="diagram shows Microsoft Viva Insights processes collaboration data from Microsoft 365 and maps descriptive employee attributes, usually from the organization's human resource information system with the collaboration data":::


The descriptive employee attributes from HRIS are known as organizational data in Viva Insights. This organizational data is uploaded by the Viva Insights admin. Because employee roles and positions change, analysts can get more accurate information when this data is updated monthly or quarterly.

You can use organizational data to group and filter employees and understand how behaviors correspond to employee attributes. Microsoft Viva Insights only requires a few basic organizational attributes, but the more data your admin adds, the more value added for analysis.

When Viva Insights processes collaboration data from Microsoft 365, it only processes metadata. Metadata is information about collaboration. For example, when and where items are sent (to and from), subject lines, and meeting attendee status. Viva Insights uses this metadata to generate metrics related to email usage, meetings, Teams instant messages, and calls. The collaboration data refreshes weekly.

Viva Insights joins the organizational data to the collaboration data. From this aggregate data collection, it generates a data model for out-of-the-box insights and analysis.

### Organizational metrics

After the data sources are processed, employee data is de-identified and filtered. This process creates a large library of behavioral base metrics related to workplace behaviors, time use, and networks.

:::image type="content" source="../media/data-to-metrics-microsoft-viva-insights-fcad6ee0.png" alt-text="diagram shows how Microsoft Viva Insights creates a large library of behavioral base metrics based on Microsoft 365 data":::


The **Home** page provides a high-level look at these metrics within the top business outcomes for visibility into how work gets done.

Peer analysis compares base metrics between groups, allowing you to use organizational attributes to filter each population. The Query designer allows you to go one step further and customize base metrics. For example, measuring "recurring meeting hours" as compared to the base metric of "meeting hours."

### Analysis outputs

The **Home** page displays insights about the most popular business outcomes. Each outcome has a high-level insight based on specific organizational data. Each outcome provides links to supporting evidence and more in-depth analysis. Leadership can use these insights to quickly identify work patterns requiring further investigation.

The Home page displays the date range and the number of measured employees that are included in the analysis. Measured employees are assigned a Microsoft Viva Insights license. The following business outcomes are displayed on the **Home** page:

 -  **Enhance organizational resiliency**. Discover ways to prepare your organization to respond to sudden changes, recover from disruption, and prosper.
 -  **Boost employee engagement**. Identify opportunities to promote job satisfaction and sense of belonging.
 -  **Improve agility**. Assess metrics related to your organization's ability to quickly adapt.

#### Query designer

Query designer gives you access to row-level data and customizable metrics. The following chart is an example of query output with organizational attributes (level, function, and region) and other related metrics (external and internal collaboration hours, meeting hours, and network size).

:::image type="content" source="../media/flexible-query-outputs-2dd4ffab.png" alt-text="diagram of query output with organizational attributes and other related metrics":::


Query output is available as a downloadable .csv file or as an OData link. This information can be loaded into other business intelligence tools, such as Power BI for impactful reports and presentations. For some queries, you can also visualize the results directly in Microsoft Viva Insights.
