The Configuration Manager connector provides details about your Configuration Manager implementation. From the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, you can review details about the Configuration Manager connector, such as the last successful synchronization time and the connection status. 

To display the Configuration Manager connector status:

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager**. Select a Configuration Manager hierarchy running version 2006, or later to display additional information about it.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Some information isn't available if the hierarchy is running Configuration Manager version 2006 or earlier.

Once you confirm your connection to Configuration Manager from Microsoft Endpoint Manager is **Healthy**, you'll have successfully attached your tenant to Configuration Manager.
