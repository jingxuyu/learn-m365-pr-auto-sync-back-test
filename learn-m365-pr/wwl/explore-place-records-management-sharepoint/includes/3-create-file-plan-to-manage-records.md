A file plan, which is your planning document for records management, typically summarizes the following information:

 -  A description of the types of items the organization decides are records.
 -  Definitions for the broader category of records the items belong to.
 -  Locations where records are stored.
 -  Retention periods for records.
 -  The person(s) responsible for managing the various kinds of records.

### Identify record types

Identifying which active documents in your organization might be declarable as records requires the collaboration of records managers, lawyers, compliance officers, and content managers. Even if your organization isn't in a highly regulated industry, there are general laws that may require it to keep records. Along with general business laws, you must evaluate legal requirements that are specific to your enterprise. Most likely, your organization is already implementing some form of records management and has filled most of the records management roles that it needs.

Generally, documents may be declarable as records after you complete the following steps in collaboration across divisions of your organization:

1.  Understand your enterprise's legal obligations and business needs.
2.  Analyze how active documents are used.
3.  Develop a list of the types of documents that should become records. For example, an organization may determine the following documents should be retained as records:
    
     -  Contracts to rent corporate space.
     -  Documents related to employees' benefits.
     -  Documents related to product research and development.
4.  Categorize the records. Records in the same category often have the same retention periods and might require similar treatment in other ways.

Record the information that you collected, including the type of record, the category that records of this type belong to, and a brief description of the record type. An example may look something like this:

:::row:::
  :::column:::

### Complete the file plan

When creating its file plan, an organization must first decide which documents it wants to keep as records. It should then create a set of record categories. Once those two activities are done, the organization can complete its file plan by providing additional information about each type of record. This information should include:

 -  How long each type of record should be retained.
 -  How records should be disposed of when the retention period expires.
 -  The primary records manager for records of this type.
 -  What kind of media are records of this type stored in.

A sample file plan may look something like this:

:::row:::
  :::column:::
