If a subprocessor has “potential to access” customer or personal data, does that mean they can view customer data whenever and however they want? While subprocessors have the potential to access certain kinds of customer data, personal data, or both, in practice access to this data is limited to what is required for subprocessors to complete their contracted work. For example, customer and personal data processed by subprocessors is often pseudonymized, allowing subprocessors to fulfill their job responsibilities without accessing non-pseudonymized data. Each type of subprocessor, Microsoft uses appropriate access controls to protect customer and personal data.

## Types of subprocessors

There are three types of subprocessors who complete contracted work for Microsoft. Each type of subprocessor must demonstrate compliance with the SSPA before they can process customer data on behalf of Microsoft.

- **Technology** subprocessors provide technologies used to deliver specific Microsoft online services. If you deploy one of these services, the subprocessors identified for that service may process, store, or otherwise access customer data or personal data while helping to provide that service.  An example of a technology supplier would be Azure Databricks where Databricks powers the Microsoft service.

- **Ancillary** subprocessors provide ancillary services to help support, operate, and maintain the online services. In such cases, the subprocessors identified may process, store, or otherwise access limited customer data or personal data while providing their ancillary services. An example of an ancillary supplier would be UserVoice where the supplier takes user feedback and uses their own algorithms to provide Microsoft with insight into customer feedback.

- **Staff Augmentation** subprocessors can take two different forms.
    - The first form of staff augmentation provides staff that supports, operates, and maintains Microsoft online services. While fulfilling their responsibilities, these subprocessors may be exposed to customer data or personal data. For example, a subprocessor may perform remote troubleshooting on a Microsoft server and while doing so may be exposed to snippets of customer data in a server crash dump log.
    - The second form of staff augmentation involves subprocessors who work side by side with Microsoft full-time employees to support, operate, and maintain the Microsoft online services. These subprocessors may be exposed to pseudonymized data as part of their work alongside Microsoft full-time employees. In all such cases, customer data or personal data resides only in Microsoft facilities, on Microsoft systems, and is subject to Microsoft policies and supervision.

## Subprocessor access controls

Each type of subprocessor at Microsoft enforces appropriate access controls to protect customer and personal data. All subprocessors are required to maintain the security and confidentiality of customer and personal data and are contractually obligated to meet strict privacy and security requirements. These requirements are equivalent to or stronger than the contractual commitments Microsoft makes to its customers in the Online Services Terms (OST).

Suppliers who perform staff augmentation work are subject to the same access controls in place for Microsoft full-time employees, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), Zero Standing Access (ZSA), and Just-In-Time (JIT) with Just-Enough-Access (JEA). Additionally, subcontractors who work in facilities or use equipment controlled by Microsoft are contractually obligated to follow our privacy standards and undergo regular privacy training.

Technology and ancillary subprocessors are responsible for implementing access controls in compliance with Microsoft Data Protection Requirements (DPR). As stated previously, these requirements meet or exceed the contractual commitments Microsoft makes to its customers in the OST. These subprocessors may have the potential to access certain restricted data, such as customer or personal data, to deliver functions in support of Microsoft online services. Subprocessor contracts specifically prohibit use of restricted data for any other purpose than contracted work. In addition, applicable controls from the DPR help to protect customer and personal data from unauthorized access or use. In many cases, the tasks subprocessors perform do not require access to original data, but can instead be accomplished with pseudonymized or anonymized data.

Subprocessors are also required to meet privacy and security requirements, including those related to implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.
