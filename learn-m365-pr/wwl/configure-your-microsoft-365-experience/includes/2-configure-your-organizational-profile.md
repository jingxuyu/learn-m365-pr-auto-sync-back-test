Completing your company’s organization profile is the starting point when setting up your company’s tenant. Some of the properties that must be maintained will cause the provisioning process to halt if they’re incomplete. For example, one such attribute is the Address line. The provisioning process will stop if an organization doesn't have a complete address.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a Global Admin to update your company's Organization profile.

Complete the following steps to edit your organization’s profile information:

1.  Go to the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home?azure-portal=true).
2.  In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Show All** ellipsis … icon to display all the navigation menu options.
3.  In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Settings** and then select **Org settings**.
4.  On the **Org settings** page, select the **Organization profile** tab.
5.  On the **Organization profile** tab, the settings are segregated by group, such as **Custom themes** and **Organization information**. Select the appropriate group, make your edits, and then save the group. Repeat this process for each group of settings as needed.<br>

The **Organization information** group contains the basic company information, such as organization name, address, phone number, and Preferred language.

> [!WARNING]
> There's one issue concerning the **Preferred language** field that you should be aware of. The preferred language determines the language for all communications that are sent from Microsoft to your organization. When you sign up, this setting also determines the language used by SharePoint Online, which your users see on your team site. If you change the Preferred language after you sign up, all future communications will be sent in the most recent language selected. However, the language used by SharePoint Online will remain in the original language selected because it can't be changed.

The **Organization information** group also contains the country or region for your subscription. The value of this field can't be changed. That's because the country or region where your organization is headquartered determines which services are available to you, along with the taxes and billing currency and the location of the Microsoft data center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To change your organization's country or region, you must sign up for a new account, choose the required country or region, and purchase a new subscription.
