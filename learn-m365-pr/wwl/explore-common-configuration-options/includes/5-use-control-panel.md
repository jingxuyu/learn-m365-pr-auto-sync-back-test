The Control Panel lets you adjust your computerï¿½s settings. Much of the functionality in the new Settings app also is present in the Control Panel. The Control Panel has been part of every Windows version since Windows 2.0. However, the Settings app replaces many possible configurable actions that were in the Control Panel previously, and it is the quickest way to make configuration changes. However, the Control Panel allows you to make more advanced changes that may not be available in the Settings app.
