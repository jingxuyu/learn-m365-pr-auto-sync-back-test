Enterprise analytics must work at massive scale on any kind of data, whether raw, refined, or highly curated.  This work typically requires enterprises to stitch together big data and data warehousing technologies into complex data pipelines that work across data in relational stores and data lakes. These kinds of solutions are difficult to build, maintain, and secure. Their complexity delays delivering the insight enterprises need.

Azure Synapse is an integrated analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. Azure Synapse brings together the best of SQL technologies used in enterprise data warehousing, Spark technologies used for big data, and Pipelines for data integration and ETL/ELT. Synapse Studio provides a unified experience for management, monitoring, coding, and security. Synapse has deep integration with other Azure services such as Power BI, CosmosDB, and AzureML.

### Industry-leading SQL

Synapse SQL is a distributed query system that enables enterprises to implement data warehousing and data virtualization scenarios using standard and familiar T-SQL experiences. It also expands the capabilities of SQL to address streaming and machine learning scenarios.

Synapse SQL offers both serverless and dedicated resource models, offering consumption and billing options to fit your needs. For predictable performance and cost, create dedicated SQL pools to reserve processing power for data stored in SQL tables. For unplanned or unpredictable workloads, use the serverless SQL endpoint.

### Industry-standard Apache Spark
