All group membership must be managed in an organization's on-premises Active Directory once it implements directory synchronization between its on-premises AD and Azure AD. Organizations can run either Azure AD Connect or Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync to implement directory synchronization. After an organization implements directory synchronization, the source of authority for its users and group membership reverts back to the on-premises Active Directory.

Directory synchronization of both users and groups in Microsoft 365 is similar. As with users, groups and their membership in Active Directory are synchronized from on-premises AD to Azure AD. And similar to the user writeback feature, group writeback also writes Microsoft 365 groups from Azure AD back to on-premises AD.

> [!NOTE]
> Group writeback is an optional feature in Azure AD Connect. However, group writeback isn't available in Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync.

Organizations must complete the following steps to enable group writeback in Azure AD Connect:

 -  Run Exchange 2013 CU8 or later, or Exchange 2016 to recognize this new group type.
 -  Create the OU and appropriate permissions required for group writeback in Active Directory. To complete this task, Azure AD Connect has a built-in cmdlet, **Initialize-ADSyncGroupWriteBack**, which automatically prepares Active Directory.

After the synchronization completes, Microsoft 365 groups will appear in the on-premises container that's selected during the configuration. They'll also be represented as distribution groups in the on-premises Active Directory.

> [!NOTE]
> The Group writeback feature doesn't involve security groups or distribution groups.

The synchronized groups won't immediately show up in an organization's on-premises Exchange Global Address List. However, either of the following cmdlets can be used to quickly make them available:

 -  Run the **Update-Recipient** cmdlet.
 -  Run either the **Update-AddressList** or **Update-GlobalAddressList** cmdlet to force the synchronized groups to appear. Keep in mind, however, that these cmdlets will require more cycles on the servers running Exchange Server.

When groups are synchronized from Azure AD to on-premises Active Directory, their group membership is also synchronized if the user accounts were created in the on-premises AD. User accounts created in Azure AD aren't included. The name attribute of the synchronized groups is filled with the ObjectGUID attribute instead of a humanly readable name.

The following graphic shows that new Microsoft 365 groups receive a distribution list on-premises for routing purposes whenever group writeback is activated.
