Communication compliance is part of the new insider risk solution set in Microsoft 365. It helps organizations minimize communication risks by detecting, capturing, and taking remediation actions for inappropriate messages. Pre-defined and custom policies enable an organization to scan internal and external communications for policy matches. These matches can then be examined by selected reviewers. Reviewers can investigate an organization's scanned email, Microsoft Teams, and third-party communications. They can then take appropriate remediation actions to ensure they're compliant with the organization's message standards.

### Integration with Microsoft 365 services

Communication compliance policies scan and capture messages across several communication channels. This process helps organizations quickly review and remediate compliance issues, including:

 -  **Microsoft Teams**. Communication compliance supports chat communications for public and private Microsoft Teams channels. Individual chats are also supported in a standalone channel source or with other Microsoft 365 services.
 -  **Exchange Online**. All mailboxes hosted on Exchange Online in your Microsoft 365 organization are eligible for scanning.
 -  **Skype for Business Online**. Communication compliance policies support scanning chat communications and associated attachments in Skype for Business Online.
 -  **Third-party sources**. You can scan messages from third-party sources for data imported into mailboxes in your Microsoft 365 organization. For details, see [Archive third-party data](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/archiving-third-party-data?azure-portal=true).

### Workflow

Communication compliance helps organizations address common pain points after complying with internal policies and regulatory compliance requirements. With focused policy templates and a flexible workflow, Compliance Center enables organizations to use actionable insights to quickly resolve detected compliance issues.

Identifying and resolving compliance issues with communication compliance in Microsoft 365 uses the following workflow:

1.  **Configure**. Identify your compliance requirements and configure applicable communication compliance policies.
2.  **Investigate**. Analyze the issues detected as matching your communication compliance policies.
3.  **Remediate**. Resolve issues, tag messages, notify individuals, escalate issues, or create a case to investigate further.
