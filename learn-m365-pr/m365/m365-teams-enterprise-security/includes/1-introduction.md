Microsoft Teams is built on the Microsoft 365 hyper-scale, enterprise-grade cloud, which includes advanced security capabilities. You can use these capabilities to ensure that Teams has state-of-the-art protection against common malicious attacks.

Suppose you are an administrator for a firm of legal advisors. Your company deals with highly sensitive information for your clients on a daily basis and you need to ensure that security is tight. You've noticed that external malicious attackers try a range of techniques to compromise your security on a regular basis. You've recently rolled out Microsoft Teams and your users have been successfully using it to increase communication and productivity. Now, you want to ensure that Teams is as well protected as the rest of your systems.

In this module, you'll look at three enterprise-grade security features for Microsoft Teams: Safe Links, Safe Attachments, and multi-factor authentication.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe how Safe Links protects your users.
- Demonstrate how Safe Attachments can prevent data compromise.
- Explain how to configure multi-factor authentication to secure access to Teams.
