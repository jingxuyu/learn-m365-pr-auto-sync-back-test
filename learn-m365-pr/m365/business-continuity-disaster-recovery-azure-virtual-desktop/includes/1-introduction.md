Natural or human-made disasters might affect the continuity of your organization's cloud infrastructure. Planning for disaster and recovery, and ensuring business-continuity plans are in place and available when needed, are key to any organization’s longevity.

Data loss isn't the only "disaster" for which IT professionals must plan. A comprehensive disaster-recovery plan also helps ensure business continuity. For example, your plan might involve redirecting requests or failing over to a secondary location when an application becomes unresponsive or a public cloud's entire region suffers an outage. 

Suppose you work for a financial organization that has offices across many different geolocations. Your organization recently suffered an outage in one of your affiliates. You want to ensure that your Azure infrastructure has the correct configuration to enable replication and recovery in case an unplanned event occurs. Your main concern is your existing Azure Virtual Desktop environment, which your employees who mostly work from home need to access company applications. 

In this module, you'll  learn how to adopt a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy for Azure Virtual Desktop. You'll also learn how to keep your apps and workload running during planned and unplanned service or Azure outages.
