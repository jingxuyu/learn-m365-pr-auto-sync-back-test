Cyber threats are an ever-present and on-going concern for all organizations regardless of size.  It's not just large organizations reported in media headlines that get attacked. The key principle of any good security threat prevention is minimizing the time between an attack and its response and resolution.

You work as a security analyst for a mid-sized enterprise organization. You have a good understanding of how Microsoft 365 Defender can help you and your security team.  You're aware that incidents are a key part of the investigation and remediation process for an attack.
