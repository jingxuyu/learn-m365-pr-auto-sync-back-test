The Microsoft identity platform implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol. This protocol is a method that a third-party app can use to access web-hosted resources on behalf of a user. The web-hosted resources can define a set of permissions that you can use to implement functionality in smaller chunks. Developers can use one of two types of permissions supported by the Microsoft identity platform depending on the app's access scenario.

In this module, you'll learn the different types of permissions supported in Azure AD applications. You'll also learn about the different consent framework models and how they're used to obtain permissions from users for use in custom apps.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of OAuth authentication flows and terminologies.
- Ability to develop with ASP.NET Core at the beginner level.
- Ability to develop with JavaScript or TypeScript at the beginner level.
- Experience using Visual Studio Code at the beginner level.
- Access to a Microsoft 365 tenant. If you don't already have one, [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or sign up for the [Microsoft 365 Developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).

## Learning objectives

- Compare and contrast different permission types supported by the Microsoft Identity platform
- Compare and contrast the difference between static and dynamic consent in user permissions
- Create an app that implements dynamic consent for incrementally obtaining permissions as needed from users
- Create an app that requests application permissions to gain direct access to resources without a signed in user present.
