SharePoint Syntex uses AI to turn complex and scattered information into understandable and actionable knowledge. Establishing a clear and thoughtful strategy for using SharePoint Syntex can determine how effective the solution is for your organization.

Suppose you work for Contoso Electronics, a large electronic components company. You've noticed a considerable volume of documents and forms are constantly being saved and shared between multiple document libraries. Several team members in your organization access these documents, from directors and managers to customer reps and technicians. While each team is spending more time searching and browsing this content for what they need, the impact has been most noticeable for Sales. Instead of spending much-needed time directly in front of clients, the Sales team is busy looking for sales contracts, purchase orders, and other important documents. Implementing a more organized, thoughtful content system would help give back essential time to Sales so that they can focus on selling.

In this module, you'll learn about the roles and responsibilities in your organization you need to support SharePoint Syntex; which key stakeholders should be involved in adoption; and how your team can align on a strategy. When you finish this module, you'll be able to organize your team for an effective rollout and develop an actionable strategy.
