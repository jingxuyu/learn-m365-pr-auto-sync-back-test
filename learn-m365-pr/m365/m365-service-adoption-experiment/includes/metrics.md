**Success measures are defined a minimum of twice in your service adoption plan.** First, you select limited success measures for your initial experiments. After you receive and analyze data from those experiments and make any appropriate course corrections, select the success measures for your broad scale adoption. It's a best practice to revisit your overall program success measures on a quarterly basis to ensure they're in alignment with your current goals. 

Success should always include measures that include the health of the service. People may be happy with the intent of change, but if they can't get to the experience, they'll ultimately have negative sentiment. **Quality, reliability, performance, and the speed with which issues are resolved must be included in your overall success measures.** To get this data, you may need to work with your IT administrator to get access to data from within your Microsoft 365 tenant. 

As you move toward continuous improvement, ever deepening the extent of usage in your organization, you'll continue to add and refine your success measures. Discuss these with your stakeholders to ensure everyone understands what you are measuring and why. Include results from employee surveys (employee sentiment), the number of help desk tickets created, and attendance at virtual or in person training programs as some examples.

|It's time to document some of your success measure for your end-user pain points. What does success look like for your end users? In the case of Microsoft Teams, a success metric might be a drop in the number of help desk requests to have documents restored from local devices. User surveys might reveal satisfaction with the experience and an increased ability to find and act on information. Use the template Business Outcomes scorecard to document your outcomes according to the four pillars.|

> Throughout this training we discuss using surveys and interviews to gather employee data. Be careful that you don't cause survey fatigue by sending surveys to the same employees too often. Design your survey strategy so that individual employees get no more than one survey every three weeks.
