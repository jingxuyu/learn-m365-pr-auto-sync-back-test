The differences that you notice in Windows 10 and 11 depend on the operating system from which you are transitioning. If you are Windows 8.1 or earlier, you will find significant differences in both functionality, look and feel. If you are using Windows 10, you will find Windows 11 is similar in functionality and management, with many elements of the user interface and general user experience updated.

This topic highlights some of the important features that are new or improved in Windows 10 and Windows 11.

 -  **Start screen and Start menu improvements.** Windows 10 continued the tile-based Start menu first introduced in Windows 8. With Windows 11, live tiles have been removed and the Start menu has been simplified. It now contains three groupings:
    
     -  Pinned apps: A customizable area that allows users to select frequently used apps.
     -  All apps: Displays an alphabetical list of all apps on the device.
     -  Recommended: Shows recently opened files and recently installed apps.
 -  **Cloud integration.** Windows 10 and later provides increased integration with cloud-based services and information. Users signing in to a Windows device can connect instantly to the information and settings that are important to them. The Windows client ensures a consistent user experience across devices, regardless of a specific device’s location.
 -  **Snap Layouts and Snap Groups.** Windows Snap was first introduced in Windows 7. Windows 11 significantly enhanced this feature, allowing users to choose layouts when hovering the mouse over the minimize/maximize option of a window and selecting where a particular app is positioned. These positions are saved in a Snap Group, and can be selected by hovering over the one of the apps in the task bar.
 -  **Widgets:** Windows 11 introduced Widgets, found on the taskbar. This is a customizable area that allows users to configure a personalized feed such as weather, calendar, stock prices, news, etc.
 -  **Windows Terminal app.** Previously a separate download, this is now included with Windows 11. This app combines Windows PowerShell, a command prompt, and Azure Cloud Shell all within the same terminal window, negating the need to open separate applications.
 -  **Chromium-based Microsoft Edge.** While previously a separate download, this version is now included starting with Windows 10 version 20H2 and Windows 11.

### Recovery tools

 -  **Reset this PC.** Introduced in Windows 10, using the *Reset this PC* feature, you can return a device to its initial state, or recover Windows from corrupted operating system files and other errors. When you launch Reset this PC, you can choose to:
    
     -  **Keep my file**s. This option retains your personal files, but removes apps and settings, and reinstalls Windows.
     -  **Remove everything**. This option removes all personal data, apps, and settings from the device, and reinstalls Windows.
 -  **Advanced start-up options.** These recovery features enable you to recover Windows 10 and 11 from common errors. Options include:
    
     -  **Use a device**. Enables you to recover Windows by using a universal serial bus (USB) drive, network connection, or recovery disk.
     -  **Troubleshoot**. Enables you to access Advanced options, including System Restore, System Image Recovery, Startup Repair, Command Prompt, and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) settings.

### Virtualization

 -  **Client Hyper-V.** Windows provides a flexible and high-performing client virtualization environment. You can use this environment to use a single device to test applications and IT scenarios in multiple operating system configurations. By using Client Hyper-V, IT departments can provide a consolidated and efficient virtual environment through virtual-machine compatibility with Windows Server.
 -  **Windows Sandbox** provides a lightweight desktop environment for temporarily running applications in an isolated environment. Launching Sandbox creates a pristine installation of Windows, isolated from the host and without the need to download or create a separate VHD. When the application is closed, everything is discarded.

### Mobility Improvements

 -  **Support for multiple device types.** Windows client runs on desktop and laptop computers, tablets and similar devices, phones, the Xbox platform, and Microsoft HoloLens, thereby providing users with extensive access to the Windows 10 environment.
 -  **Bring Your Own Device support.** Many users have their own personal computing devices, and they might wish to connect these devices to their corporate networks so that they can access apps and services, and work with data files. Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is the ability to connect users’ personal devices to a corporate network. Windows 10 introduced many features that improve the support of users who wish to bring their own devices.
 -  **Mobile broadband.** Windows provides support for embedded wireless radio. This support helps to improve power efficiency and reduce the size of some devices.
 -  **Broadband tethering.** You can turn your Windows 10 or later device into a Wi-Fi hotspot.
 -  **Autotriggered VPN.** If an app requires access to your company’s intranet, Windows can automatically trigger a virtual private network (VPN) connection.

### Security Enhancements

 -  **Remote Business Data Removal.** With Windows client and Windows Server, you can use Remote Business Data Removal to classify and flag corporate files, and to differentiate between these files and user files. With this classification, the remote wipe of a Windows device will not remove user-owned data when securing or removing corporate data on the device.
 -  **Improved biometrics.** Windows 10 introduced many improvements in the area of biometrics, including the use of Windows sign-in, remote access, and user account control (UAC). Furthermore, you can configure biometric authentication to enable Microsoft Store access.
 -  **Pervasive device encryption.** On Microsoft Surface devices, device encryption is enabled by default, and you can configure additional BitLocker Drive Encryption protection. You also can enable additional management capabilities on the Windows client Pro and Enterprise editions.
 -  **Malware resistance.** Microsoft Defender now includes network-behavior monitoring that can help to detect and prevent the execution of known and unknown malware.
 -  **Device lockdown.** The Assigned Access feature enables you to restrict the Microsoft Store app experience on a device to a specific subset of apps, or even to a single app. This could be a line-of-business (LOB) app in a kiosk scenario, or a set of educational apps for children in a school setting.
 -  **Virtual secure mode.** This is a secure process-execution environment that Windows 10 introduces. This execution environment helps protect system processes by running them in a separate, virtualized container, known as a trustlet, rather than in the operating system itself. Because the Windows operating system does not have access to these trustlets, processes and data within them are safer.
 -  **Nearby Sharing.** Nearby Sharing lets you instantly share your videos, photos, documents, and websites with people and devices near you over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

### Windows as a Service

Windows 10 first introduced a new method of delivering new features and functional changes. This method is known as Windows as a Service. This is a major change from the past, when new Windows versions arrived approximately every three years. Windows releases quality updates regularly, while significant changes, also known as feature updates, will occur annually. Security and driver updates will automatically download and install as soon as they become available for some Windows client editions. Other editions can defer some updates for a non-configurable period.
