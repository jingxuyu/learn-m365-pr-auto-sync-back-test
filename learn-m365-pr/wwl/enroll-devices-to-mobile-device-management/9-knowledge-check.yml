  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso uses Microsoft Intune as its mobile device management provider. Contoso's Enterprise Administrator, Holly Dickson, recently learned that Intune deleted several devices. Upon further investigation, Holly discovered the devices' MDM certificates were never renewed and had expired. How many days must a device remain idle after its MDM certificate expires before Intune deletes the devices from its service?"
    choices:
    - content: "60 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value isn't the correct number of days that a device must remain idle after its MDM certificate expires before Intune deletes the device from its service."
    - content: "90 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value isn't the correct number of days that a device must remain idle after its MDM certificate expires before Intune deletes the device from its service."
    - content: "180 days"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The MDM certificate renews automatically as long as enrolled devices communicate with the Microsoft Intune service. The MDM certificate doesn't renew for devices that have been wiped, or that fail to sync with Microsoft Intune for an extended period of time. Microsoft Intune deletes idle devices from record 180 days after the MDM certificate expires."
