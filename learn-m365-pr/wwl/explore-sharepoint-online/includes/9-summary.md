In this module, you learned about SharePoint Online, which is part of the Microsoft 365 suite of products. SharePoint Online is an Intranet-based website application. It allows companies to collaborate and manage content across the span of their network and beyond. Since SharePoint Online is a managed service, anyone of your companyâ€™s users can access the SharePoint Online experience if there's an internet connection.

SharePoint Online is used for many different purposes and can be managed from either PowerShell or through the SharePoint admin center. Some functions will be unavailable because SharePoint Online is a managed service. However, companies can have other management options by setting up a hybrid environment. A hybrid deployment dictates that changes be made on-premises versus in the cloud, and it allows for greater PowerShell management. You learned that some of the key benefits to using SharePoint Online include:

 -  Local Site management
 -  Encryption Services
 -  Data Loss Prevention
 -  Anti- Malware Protection

You learned in this module that SharePoint Online allows for its own independent, intranet site collections. An organization can have many intranet sites that are segregated or correlated depending on its needs. This design provides organizations with the total autonomy they need to create secure site collections.

This module also examined how SharePoint Online provides anti-malware protection for files uploaded and saved to document libraries. This protection is provided by the Microsoft anti-malware engine that is also integrated into Exchange. This anti-malware service runs on all SharePoint Online web front ends.
