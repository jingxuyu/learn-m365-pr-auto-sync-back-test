Microsoft recently announced its intention to move Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Skype for Business users to Teams. This brings up some critical questions:
- If youâ€™re a current Skype for Business Online user, what does this mean for you? 
- If you are currently considering implementing a collaborative platform, should you choose Skype for Business Online or opt for Teams?

>[!NOTE]
>Microsoft Teams is now the primary client for messaging, meetings and calling in Office 365. Soon, new Office 365 customers with 500 users or less will be onboarded to Microsoft Teams and will no longer have access to Skype for Business Online. Tenants that are already using Skype for Business Online will be able to continue doing so (including provisioning new users) until they complete their transition to Microsoft Teams.

## How to choose the right collaboration solution

The collaboration tool that you select from M365 will vary depending upon your how your organization works and your business needs. Use the following to help provide some guidance: 
- Find yourself using email most of the time? Then, use groups in Exchange Online/Outlook for email-based collaboration.
- Want to connect across your organization to have company-wide discussions? Use Yammer, the social network for work, to create communities of interest.
- Participating in project work with colleagues? Use Microsoft Teams, the chat-based workspace.
- Want to make calls and hold online meetings? Use Skype for Business for voice and video meetings on any device.
- Need to store and share team files? Use SharePoint for file collaboration and intranet sites.
