Users [must be signed in with their school account](https://support.microsoft.com/office/how-microsoft-search-in-bing-helps-keep-your-info-secure-cbce46ae-bb1f-4d0e-86f1-5984f4589113) to find school results using Microsoft Search. This account is the same one they use to sign in to Microsoft Teams or other Microsoft 365 apps. Users won't see school results with a personal Microsoft account.

If a user is already signed in to Microsoft Edge or a Microsoft 365 app or site, they’re all set. They'll be automatically signed in when they go to Bing. When your users search on Bing, there are two locations they'll see school results:

## All results page

The most relevant school answer appears in Bing results on the All page

* Public results allow users to explore the breadth and depth of the web
* Ads are never targeted based on a user’s school identity

## School results page

Only school results appear on the School page; web results are excluded.
