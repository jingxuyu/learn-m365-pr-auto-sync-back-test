Your organization requires a current, secure, and highly scalable Azure Virtual Desktop solution to support its employees who work remotely, and to protect them from planned and unplanned failures.

Disaster planning and recovery are a critical element of IT operations. This is true whether an organization's systems are located on-premises, in the cloud, or a combination of both. Public cloud platforms offer services for backing up critical data and restoring it when lost. They also offer services for failing over to secondary systems when primary systems fail, and mitigating (and recovering from) the effects of these failures.

In this module, you learned how to implement protection of your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. You also learned how to protect your company from different failure scenarios and help ensure business continuity.
