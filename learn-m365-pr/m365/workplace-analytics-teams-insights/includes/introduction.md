The Workplace Analytics Teams insights dashboard uses a Power Business Intelligence (BI) template that's populated with data on the use and adoption of Microsoft Teams in your organization. This dashboard highlights where groups might be struggling to move to digital collaboration. It offers a measurable starting point for helping leaders understand how they can make Teams adoption easier.

The dashboard helps you answer the following top-level business questions:

- What does Teams adoption look like so far?
- How can Teams help employees speed communication?
- How does Teams help employees network and build connections?
- Where should you focus training and education for Teams adoption?
- How can community influencers help drive the adoption of Teams?
- Are employees working after-hours in Teams?

The answers to these questions can help to protect the well-being of employees by helping leaders make digital collaboration more effective.

Suppose you work as a digital transformation analyst, and your organization started using Microsoft Teams five months ago. You need to find a way to track whether employees are successfully adopting Teams, and how they're using it. You suspect Teams usage has increased over time to replace email, but you're hearing different stories about its usage from various departments. Since Microsoft 365 collaboration metrics can be measured using Workplace Analytics data, you decide to use the Power BI Teams insights dashboard to get a look at how your organization has transitioned to Teams.
