1. **Add domains**
    After creating the tenant, you will need to add domains for your organization. We recommend creating a small number of domains to start (for example, one for teachers and one for students). You can add domains in the Office admin center.

1. **Configure admin and security settings**
    Now you can start setting admin and security settings through the Microsoft 365 admin center. You can also leverage admin center settings recommendations to streamline this process.

1. **Migrate storage to OneDrive for business (recommended)**
    Now you can start moving curriculum content to the cloud and host it in Teams, OneNote, or OneDrive. If you plan to use OneDrive, you should start this process with [known folder redirection](/onedrive/redirect-known-folders).

1. **Onboard printers (recommended)**
    In order to use and manage your existing printer fleet in the cloud, you will need to start onboarding these devices to [Microsoft Universal Print](/universal-print/).

1. **Connect Configuration Manager to Intune (optional)**
    If you are already using Configuration Manager, you may want to connect to Intune. This enables current devices to be managed by both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune.
