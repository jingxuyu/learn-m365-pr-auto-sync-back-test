      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Device Manager is a Windows component that allows users to view and control the hardware that's attached to a computer. Try again."
  - content: "Mary is a sales rep for World Wide Importers. After one of Mary's co-workers retired, they attached the co-worker's old dot matrix printer to her Windows 10 laptop. They located a DVD with the print driver from her co-worker's left-over files, so they installed the DVD on her computer. Given the age of the printer, Mary had to attach it to a serial (COM) port on her computer. When Mary tried printing to the printer, Windows wouldn't detect the printer. Mary has never had their own printer before, so they're reluctant to throw it out. They know the printer works because they recently saw their co-worker use it before retiring. What should Mary do to try and get the printer to work?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hit the side of the printer with a hammer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this is a tempting option for Mary, it's probably not the best solution. Try again."
    - content: "Reinstall the print driver"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Mary can try this, there's a better solution available. Try again."
    - content: "Configure a printer port manually"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Windows can automatically detect printers when you connect them to your computer. Windows also installs the printer driver without interaction if the driver is available in the driver store. However, a Windows operating system may not detect network printers, or printers that you connect to older ports, such as serial (COM) or parallel (LPT) ports. In these cases, you must configure a printer port manually."
  - content: "Holly Dickson, Contoso's Desktop Administrator, installed a new USB printer to her Windows 11 laptop. After attaching the printer, Holly installed the printer driver. Everything seems in order, but Holly can't get the printer to function properly. What should Holly do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Return the printer."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Holly can do this, there is a better option. Try again."
    - content: "Unattach the printer, remove the device driver, and then reinstall each."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Holly can do this, there is a better option. Try again."
    - content: "Install the printer driver before attaching the printer."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Some USB printers require that you install the printer driver before you attach it. Failure to follow this procedure can result in the printer not functioning correctly. Check the product documentation before attaching the printer to your computer."
