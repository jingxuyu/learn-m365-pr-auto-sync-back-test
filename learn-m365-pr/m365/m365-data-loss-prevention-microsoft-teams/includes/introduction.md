Organizations must protect sensitive information and prevent inadvertent disclosure. Regulations regarding the protection of data change from time to time. The goal of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.

Suppose you work in your organization's IT department. The organization has recently migrated to Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 and wants to leverage the DLP capabilities offered by Microsoft. You've been tasked to look at how you can incorporate DLP to protect data.

In this module, you'll learn:

- What a DLP policy contains
- How DLP policies work
- About DLP and Microsoft Teams
- Creating a DLP policy from a template
- Create a custom DLP policy
