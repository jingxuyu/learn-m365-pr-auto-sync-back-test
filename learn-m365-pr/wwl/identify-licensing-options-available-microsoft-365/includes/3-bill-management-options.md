### Billing Account Options

A **billing account** is created when you sign up to try or buy Microsoft products. You use your billing account to manage your account settings, invoices, payment methods, and purchases. The **Microsoft 365 admin center** currently supports the following type of billing accounts:

 -  **Microsoft Online Services Program.** This billing account is created when you sign up for a Microsoft 365 subscription directly.
 -  **Microsoft Products &amp; Services Agreement (MPSA) Program:** This billing account is created when your organization signs an MPSA Volume Licensing agreement to purchase software and online services.
 -  **Microsoft Customer Agreement:** This billing account is created when your organization works with a Microsoft representative, an authorized partner, or purchases independently.

### Bill Management

**Microsoft 365 billing** is managed from the **Microsoft 365 admin center.** The admin center allows you to manage subscriptions, view billing statements, update payment methods, change your billing frequency, and more. The following list describes in further detail what can be reviewed and modified in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

 -  **Upgrade, renew, reactivate or cancel subscriptions.**
 -  **View the number of purchased licenses** and how many of those licenses are assigned to individual users for each service.
 -  **View a bill, invoice, and past billing statements.**
 -  **Modify payment methods** like updating, deleting, replacing, and adding other types of payment. Payment options can include credit or debit card, bank account, or pay by invoice using a check or electronic funds transfer (EFT).
 -  **Modify your billing frequency** to monthly or annual billing.
 -  **Buy and manage other services or features.** For example, depending on your Microsoft 365 subscription, you can add on Advanced eDiscovery storage, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Teams Calling Plan, and more.
 -  **Manage your billing notification emails and invoice attachments,** such as the list of email accounts of who should receive automated billing notifications, and renewal reminders for the subscription.
