Technology can assist you in driving change. These Microsoft 365 features can be tools for your change initiative.

## What are personal insights?

Viva Insights generates data regarding your personal productivity, such as how people spend their time and who they spend it with. Personal insights present you with insights through the following tools:

* **Viva Insights in Teams** - Shows you personal insights within your Microsoft Teams flow of work, including how to stay connected, protect time, use Headspace for guided meditation, and start a virtual commute.
* **Dashboard** - The dashboard shows how you spent your time over the past month, productivity insights about your work patterns, helpful suggestions for improvement, and information about your network, top collaborators, and collaboration activities.
* **Viva Insights Outlook add-in** - The Insights add-in for Outlook presents you with activity cards that are based on your recent work experience with options to respond or follow up, based on the activity.
* **Monthly digests** - Receive a weekly digest that gives you highlights about your previous week.

### Use personal insights

Managers can access their personal insights through the Viva Insights apps, such as the MyAnalytics dashboard, or the Viva Insights app in Teams to see statistics about their work patterns over the past month. Statistics include their focus and collaboration time, how many days they were able to disconnect from work, and how effectively they're networking with their coworkers.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Information available in the Viva Insights is private and personal metrics are only available for individual access. Managers will need a supported Microsoft 365 license to access Viva Insights.

## What are Plans?

You can use the Plans feature in Workplace Analytics to create improvement plans for employees, with the goal of changing their work habits for the better. By using the Plans feature, you can:

* Identify groups whose workplace effectiveness could be improved.
* Set up 12-week plans for the identified group.
* Measure the progress of the plan while it's underway.

If you have the Analyst, Limited analyst, or Program manager role, you can open Workplace Analytics and select **Plans** > **New Plan**. There you can learn about the types of plans that you can create.

:::image type="content" source="../media/learn-types-plans.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the different plan types." lightbox="../media/learn-types-plans.png":::

You can then either select a known group of employees to enroll in the plan or use analysis to find a group of employees to enroll. After enrolling participants in a plan, you can track their progress on key metrics over time.

In addition to its standard weekly digest, the digest for plan participants includes a section that summarizes their progress in the plan. They can visit their Dashboard to see a page dedicated to their enrolled plan.

## What are Team and Group insights for team leads and people managers?

Team and Group insights for people managers provide managers with behavioral measures of employee experience and team effectiveness. Team leads and managers can leverage My team and Team insights to track progress, view suggested actions, and launch a plan for their team.

>[!NOTE]
>Managers and team leads cannot access data on individuals. Managers who are assigned access can only see data on their team in an aggregate view. The default group size threshold is ten, including the manager.

For example, managers can see the following in Team insights:

:::image type="content" source="../media/team-insights.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Team insights for people managers" lightbox="../media/team-insights.png":::

After identifying an opportunity, the manager can take action by enrolling team members into a plan.
