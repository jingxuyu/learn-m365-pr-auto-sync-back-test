Microsoft certification programs assure high-quality experience in Teams. There are various certified programs for different services and features in Teams.  

## Microsoft 365 App compliance program
The Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program, is a three tier approach to app security and compliance. Each tier builds upon the next – offering a layered program to give users the confidence they need while using apps in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

* **Publisher Verification** helps admins and users understand the authenticity of app developers integrating with the Microsoft identity platform. When an app is marked as publisher verified, the publisher has verified their identity using a Microsoft Partner Network account and associated this MPN account with their application registration.

* **Publisher Attestation** is where developers share general, data handling, and security and compliance information about their app service. This reduces the need for IT admins to work directly with app publishers. All the information needed to make an informed decision can be found for all apps that have completed the publisher attestation in one place and in a consistent format. 

* **Microsoft 365 Certification** offers assurance and confidence to organizations that data and privacy are adequately secured and protected when using Microsoft Teams apps. Certification confirms that an app solution is compatible with Microsoft technologies, compliant with cloud app security best practices, and supported by Microsoft. 

## Microsoft Teams certified devices

Microsoft Teams Certification programs ensure a higher-quality bar with higher performance targets and audio quality metrics. The programs ensure that customers high-quality audio calls and meetings experience when using certified desk phones and conference phones.

Partners are actively working to meet this higher bar and are qualifying devices against certification requirements. 

For Teams certified devices, see [Microsoft Teams devices](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices?azure-portal=true).

## Microsoft Teams connected contact center certification program

For organizations that want solutions with business tools and workflows to drive the customer journey, contact center integration for Microsoft Teams allows Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solution providers to integrate their solutions into Teams.

## Microsoft Teams certified compliance recording

In addition to publishing publicly available APIs allowing partners to develop and integrate CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) solutions with Teams, Microsoft has developed the compliance recording for Microsoft Teams certification program to provide customers with the assurance that each participating partner’s solution has been tested and verified to provide the quality, compatibility, and reliability they expect from Microsoft solutions.

## Microsoft certified session border controller (SBC) 
Microsoft partners with selected Session Border Controllers (SBC) vendors to certify that their SBCs work with Direct Routing. Microsoft works with each vendor to:

* Jointly work on the SIP interconnection protocols.

* Perform intense tests using a third-party lab. Only devices that pass the tests are certified.

* Run daily tests with all certified devices in production and pre-production environments. Validating the devices in pre-production environments guarantees that new versions of Direct Routing code in the cloud will work with certified SBCs.

* Establish a joint support process with the SBC vendors.

For the list of certified session border controller (SBC), see [Certified SBC vendors](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/direct-routing-border-controllers#certified-sbc-vendors?azure-portal=true).

## Microsoft certified cloud video interop (CVI)

Cloud Video Interop (CVI) is a Microsoft Qualified third-party solution that enables third-party meeting rooms (telepresence) and personal video devices (VTCs) to join Microsoft Teams meetings.

With Microsoft Teams, you get rich online content collaboration in meetings that include audio, video, and content sharing. This can be enjoyed through the desktop and web client, and through many partner devices that integrate natively with Microsoft Teams. However, many originations have already invested in video teleconferencing and personal video communication devices, which can be expensive to upgrade. Cloud Video Interop provides an easy solution, allowing you to keep using your existing solutions until you are ready to upgrade.
