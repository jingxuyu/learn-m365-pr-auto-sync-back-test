Proper planning is required when deploying a new Windows version within an organization. The existing environment, including the devices, hardware specifications, applications in use, and the user’s expectations, all play a factor in determining the best method for installing Windows. It's common for organizations to implement several strategies, depending on the scenario.

Historically, an organization would wipe the device and reimage it with the preferred Windows edition and configuration defined by IT. Reimaging the machine would be performed regardless of whether the device was new or upgraded. Despite being costly and time-consuming, reimaging is a repeatable process that ensures the device has the correct OS configuration.

The traditional wipe and load process require creating a custom Windows image for the organization. This method involves identifying and getting all the needed drivers and apps for reinstallation and significant engineering effort to implement the process. These processes have existed for quite some time, and Windows 10 and 11 continue to support this process.

Windows 10 introduced new alternatives to help simplify this process, allowing administrators to apply configurations to the existing installation instead of wiping the entire OS. If a current device has Windows 10 or 11 installed, the installation itself is likely okay. Instead of replacing the whole OS to get a specific configuration, administrators reconfigure the existing OS to the organization’s desired specifications, including the correct Windows edition. The result is virtually the same as a wipe and reload, but they accomplish without the extra time and network overhead of reimaging the entire device. This concept is valid for existing and new devices, as more recent devices are sold with Windows already installed.
