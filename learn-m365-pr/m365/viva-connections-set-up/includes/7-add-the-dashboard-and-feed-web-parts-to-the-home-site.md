The Viva Connections mobile experience automatically includes the three
components that make up Viva Connections - the Dashboard, the Feed, and
Resources. In the desktop experience, Viva Connections can be
incorporated into your organization’s home site by using web parts that
were designed specifically for Viva
Connections.

There are two distinct web parts that can be used on the home site when
Viva Connections is set up:

[The Dashboard web part](/viva/connections/use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site)
(Highlighted in red) displays cards from the Dashboard. Audience
targeting and other customizations will transfer through the web
part.

[The Feed web
part](/viva/connections/use-feed-web-part-for-viva-connections)
(Highlighted in purple) displays news, videos, and Yammer conversations
on the home site. Content is personalized to the
viewer.

On desktop, Resources will display in a left-hand panel when the Viva
Connections icon in the Teams app bar has been selected twice. Consider
adding both web parts to the home site to complete the Viva Connections
experience.

**Add Viva Connections web parts to your home
site:**

Site owners and members for the home site have permission to add and
customize web parts. Content in the web parts will automatically update
as content dynamically changes.

1. Navigate to the home site and select **Edit.**
2. Hover over sections and when the plus sign ( **+** ) appears, select it to open the web part tools box.
3. Type **Viva Connections** in the search box to find the web parts. Use the [Dashboard](/viva/connections/use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site) web part in a 1/3 vertical section. Use the [Feed web part](/viva/connections/use-feed-web-part-for-viva-connections) in a section that’s noticeable.
4. Select **Republish** when you are done to share with others.
