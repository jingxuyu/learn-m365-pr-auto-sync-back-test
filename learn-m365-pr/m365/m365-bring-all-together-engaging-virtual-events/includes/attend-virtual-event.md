Finally - the attendee. Teams meetings and live events run most smoothly if all participants are familiar with the available tools before they join and during the meeting. You want to provide some basic training for all your users so when they join a meeting, they can get the most out of it and avoid disrupting the meeting flow for other participants.

## Live event attendee experience

Teams Live Events are designed to support larger audiences so the attendee experience is different from a standard Teams meeting. The live event attendee experience includes pause and play controls, Closed Captioning if it’s been enabled for the event, as well as a Q&A window to ask and view questions.

Captions can help hearing impaired attendees or people in noisy environments. To turn on live captions, select **Captions/Subtitles On** in the video controls:

## Attend a Teams meeting

Teams meetings are for smaller audiences with full interactivity between the attendees and the speaker. Here you’ll review the settings and tools available in a Teams meeting.

Before you join the meeting, you'll see this screen, where you can set up your experience:

The tools include:

1. A switch to turn your camera on or off.
1. A switch to mute or unmute your microphone.
1. Device settings. Use this tool to select the right speakers, microphone, and camera.
1. The **Join now** button joins you to the meeting.
1. The **Audio off** option is useful when you’re joining from a room where there is already an active mic and speaker.
1. The **Phone audio** option enables you to join the meeting audio by using a mobile device or fixed line telephone.
1. The **Add a room** option allows you to add a conference room to the meeting audio.

Many of the settings can be changed during the meeting if you have problems.

- **Desktop.** Use this option to share everything on one of your computer screens.
- **Windows.** Use this option to share only one app.

> The **Include System Audio** option is unchecked by default. Check the box if you want to play a video or audio clip.

You should also be familiar with the **More actions** menu:
