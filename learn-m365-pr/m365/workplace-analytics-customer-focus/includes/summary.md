This module provides high-level guidance on the framework to drive insights in the Customer Focus use case, key considerations to run a successful project, and tools to facilitate and increase the effectiveness of the change management.

As the sales analytics lead, you can now use Workplace Analytics with the integration of CRM data to drive insights on sales employeesâ€™ external collaboration, time spent with colleagues in internal processes, and coaching and onboarding activities that set them up for success.

Based on the results, your leaders are now able to make informed decisions that help sales employees prioritize the most important accounts, construct effective teams to drive customer satisfaction and high-value deals, optimize account coverage and sales performance, streamline internal processes to leave more time for external-facing activities, and make sure managers provide sufficient support and coaching.

As introduced earlier in the module, many external-facing functions can benefit from the insights and take actions that maximize productivity and effectiveness of external-facing activities. Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how your organization can benefit by using Workplace Analytics to improve customer focus.
- Understand the many ways you can analyze collaboration data to improve customer focus.
- Determine project scoping, data requirements, and how you can create value with your customer focus analysis.
- Know which Microsoft 365 tools you can use to effectively track and manage customer focus initiatives.
