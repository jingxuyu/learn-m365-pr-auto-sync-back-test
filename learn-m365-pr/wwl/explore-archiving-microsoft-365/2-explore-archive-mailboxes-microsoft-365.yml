quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is managing Contoso's pilot project that's testing in-place archiving. As part of the pilot, Holly configured Outlook in cached mode on a laptop belonging to a pilot project teammate. The result of this action was twofold. First, Holly saw that the amount of space required for caching on the laptop was reduced. Second, the user was only able to access their archive mailbox content when the laptop was connected to Exchange. What was the cause of these two issues after Holly configured Outlook in cached mode on the laptop?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user's archive mailbox wasn't cached on the laptop"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Even if Outlook is configured in cached mode, the archive mailbox isn't cached on the client computer. This process reduces the amount of space required for caching on the client. It also means the user can access the archive mailbox content only when connected to Exchange."
    - content: "By configuring Outlook in cached mode, the user's mail content was stored in a .pst file on the laptop"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. By configuring Outlook in cached mode on the laptop, the user's mail content is NOT stored in a .pst file on the laptop."
    - content: "When you use cached mode for your primary mailbox, a local index is created on your computer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this item is true, it's not what caused the two issues that Holly experienced on the laptop."
