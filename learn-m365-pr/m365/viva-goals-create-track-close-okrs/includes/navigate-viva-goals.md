Before we talk about entering and managing your OKRs within Viva Goals, it's helpful to familiarize yourself with the look of the system and how it's structured. Below we'll look at the main features on the Viva Goals screen and how to navigate the system.

## Time Period Selector (1)

The first key component to focus on is the **Time Period Selector (1)**.

Selecting the relevant time period will help determine what OKR content is displayed in the main section of the screen.

The time period(s) available to choose from can be customized depending on the needs of your organization. There's also the option to have multiple time periods selected at the same time.

## Navigation Sidebar (2)

Along the left of the screen is the Navigation Sidebar (2). This is where you can navigate to different areas and features in the system. A few of the more important tabs are listed below.

### OKR Entities

There are three standard entities within Viva Goals: Individual, Team, Organization.

These represent the different levels at which OKRs can be created.

- **Individual** - Select the **My OKRs** tab to display any OKRs that are assigned to you. The **My OKRs** tab is represented by the icon of a person.
- **Team** - Select the **My Team(s)** tab to display the OKRs owned by the team or teams that an individual belongs to. A hierarchy of teams will have been created to match the structure of your Organization. The **My Team(s)** tab is represented by an Organization Chart Icon.
- **Organization** - Select the **Organization** tab - which is represented by the name of your company - to display the highest level at which OKRs can be set. These are the organization-wide Objectives and Key Results. The **Organization** tab is represented by the Globe icon.

### Bookmarks

Select the **Bookmark** tab in the **Navigation Sidebar** to easily find Objective Explorer Views, Teams, and Individuals that you've previously bookmarked

### Explorer

This is the main reporting feature in Viva Goals and is available to all users. Here you can filter all the OKR data to create custom **Views**. These can be saved and returned to in the future. **Views** can be either private or shared with the wider organization.

### All Teams

This is where your team structure in Viva Goals can be explored. You can search for a specific team or navigate down through the cascading levels to select the team you require.

### All Users

The **All Users** tab allows you to search for a specific colleague. By going to their profile, you can review the progress of their OKRs.

### Feed

Your **Feed** will display the activity that is going on in your organization. You can **Like** and **Comment** on the activity to increase engagement with your colleagues.

### Support Center

If you ever need more information on a particular Viva Goals feature or piece of functionality, the **Support Center** tab provides access to help and learning content.
