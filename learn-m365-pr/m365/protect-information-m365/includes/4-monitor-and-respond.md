There are two key activities in the “Monitor” phase of the information protection lifecycle. First, you need to **gain visibility** into all the events impacting your environment. Second, you need to take action or remediate, based on the event.

You can attain visibility into relevant activity and events comes in several ways. You can review reports and alerts on policy violations, sensitive document access & sharing. You can also review cloud app usage and anomalous activity, such as a large download of data from a specific cloud app within a certain period of time. 

It’s important to have visibility, but it’s just as important to be able to take immediate action in order to better protect your sensitive information. For example, if you are finding end-user productivity is being negatively impacted because of restrictive DLP policies, you can tune your policies to find the right balance. Or, if you become aware of anomalous activity or inappropriate sharing, you can immediately revoke app access, quarantine a file or a user. 

For customers that use a security incident and event management system (SIEM), you can also feed certain events, such as DLP events, into these systems in order to give customers a centralized reporting and monitoring experience.
Here’s a closer look at some of the monitoring capabilities in Microsoft 365.

## Microsoft Information Protection label analytics

The Label Analytics dashboard aggregates label insights so that you can see how sensitivity and retention labels are being used for both Office 365 and non-Office 365 data.
