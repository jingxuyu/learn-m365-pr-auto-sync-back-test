After planning and designing your new virtual summit, you've come to realize that Microsoft 365 supports three distinct options. You can run small events up to 1,000 people with a normal Microsoft Teams Meeting. Using all its tools for video and screen sharing, and interactivity between meeting attendees. When your audience is larger, up to 100,000 people, Microsoft supports you with Live Events.

Here you'll see how to make the decision on which approach to is best to take. 

## Select your event experience

The best tool to use for your event depends on the experience you want for your attendees.

### Teams Meeting

The table has four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

Under the columns are three rows. In each row there are cells highlighted in blue, which show the kind of experience best supported by Microsoft Teams. These cells are Single event, Event series, Part of an engagement community, Open two-way discussion, up to 300, and simple webcam and screen share.

> \* There is currently an increased limit to 20,000 this will reduce back down to the normal supported limit of 10,000 after December 31, 2021.<br/>
> \** Stream live events are normally only allowed inside your organization. You can make them available outside if you arrange support for your event from the Live Events Assistance Program (LEAP) team. 

### Which Live Event experience should you use

If you've decided that a Live Event is the right choice to deliver your virtual event, you still have a choice on the tools you can use.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/live-events-decision-matrix.png" alt-text="A decision matrix that guides the reader through choosing Teams, Yammer, or Stream for your Live Event.":::
This diagram has two paths, if you'll have up to 20,000 people - 10,000 after December 31st 2021 - or you've up to 100,000. For the 20,000 path, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 and no attendee discussion and custom video production then Live Events with Stream is the better option.

Using the above decision matrix, you can see that for events with up to 20,000 people watching, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 with no attendee discussion and custom video production, then Live Events with Stream is the best option. Remember that Streams can only be used outside your organization with the support of your event from the LEAP team.

## Combination events

Having read about all the different event scenarios you'll see that in most cases events will use a combination of all the above. For your summit, you'll want to have small breakout sessions that support different content tracks. These sessions will be run as Microsoft Teams Meetings. The moderators will encourage two-way conversations, with attendees able to share their own content and videos.
