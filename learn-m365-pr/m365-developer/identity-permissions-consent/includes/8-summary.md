In this module, you learned the different types of permissions supported in Azure AD applications. You also learned about the different consent framework models and how they're used to obtain permissions from users for use in custom apps.

You learned that when permissions are granted on behalf of a signed in user, they're delegated permissions. When an app is granted permissions to access resources directly (without a signed in user), it uses application permissions.

You tested and saw how the consent experience differs for both end users and admins based on whether it's static consent or dynamic consent. Dynamic consent is the preferred way of requesting permissions from users. It enables developers of apps to request only the basic permissions required during initial sign-in, then incrementally request additional permissions as the user performs other tasks with the app. It's also recommended that developers list all permissions they will need in the Azure portal list, so that if admins want to reduce user friction by granting admin consent they can do so.
