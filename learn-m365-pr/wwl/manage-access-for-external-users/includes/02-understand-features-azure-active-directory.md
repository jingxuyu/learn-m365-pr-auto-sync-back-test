Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the cloud-based identity and access management service for Microsoft 365. 

You can use Azure AD to control access to your apps and your app resources, based on your business requirements. For example, you can use Azure AD to require multifactor authentication when accessing important organizational resources. Additionally, you can use Azure AD to automate user provisioning between your existing Windows Server AD and your cloud apps, including Microsoft 365. Finally, Azure AD gives you powerful tools to automatically help protect user identities and credentials and to meet your access governance requirements.

## External collaboration in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365
Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive are three of the most used ways to collaborate and share content with external users. 

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) business-to-business (B2B) collaboration is a feature within External Identities that lets you invite guests to collaborate with your organization. With B2B collaboration, you can securely share Microsoft 365 applications and services with guests from any other organization, while maintaining control over your own corporate data. 

With Azure AD B2B, the partner uses their own identity management solution, so there is no external administrative overhead for your organization. Guests sign in to your apps and services with their own work, school, or social identities.

* The partner uses their own identities and credentials; Azure AD is not required.
* You don't need to manage external accounts or passwords.
* You don't need to sync accounts or manage account lifecycles.
