  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When Safe Links is enabled, what does it do when it encounters a malicious link?"
    choices:
    - content: "All links are removed from the message"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Safe Links is selective enough to remove only malicious links. Even within a single email, only the malicious links will be removed. If there are other links that are safe, the user can select them and navigate to the target websites without interference."
    - content: "The user is blocked from continuing to the site, and the browser displays a warning page"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An MX record ensures that email sent to the tenantâ€™s domain will arrive in mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online through the EOP service."
    - content: "An email notification is sent to the user indicating the URL in the original message was blocked"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't what Safe Links does when testing a URL."
