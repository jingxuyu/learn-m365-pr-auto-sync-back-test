OneDrive is the files hub for Office 365. OneDrive enables users to access and collaborate on files no matter where they're stored. Microsoft Graph enables developers to use a single API to work with the files in OneDrive. Files in Office 365 are stored in drives. Users can store files in a personal drive, their OneDrive, or in a shared drive powered by a SharePoint document library.

In this module, you learned how to access files in OneDrive, both reading and writing files, and how to traverse relationships between files and users.
