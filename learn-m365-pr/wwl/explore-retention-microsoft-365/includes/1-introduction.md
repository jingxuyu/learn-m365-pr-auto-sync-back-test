The different Microsoft 365 locations, such as Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint document libraries, have become repositories of valuable data. They're a common medium for communication and collaboration between information workers in organizations of all sizes. As a best practice, organizations should establish policies to control the life cycle of all messaging data and content that's saved across the following locations:

 -  Exchange email
 -  SharePoint sites
 -  OneDrive accounts
 -  Microsoft 365 groups
 -  Skype for Business
 -  Exchange public folders
 -  Teams channel messages
 -  Teams chats
 -  Teams private channel messages
 -  Yammer community messages
 -  Yammer user messages

For example, even with good data governance, SharePoint sites can proliferate and grow out of control. Sites are created as they're needed, but sites are rarely deleted. If sites persist when they're no longer needed, they require storage space and they might be unwanted for compliance reasons.

Deletion and preservation of data is managed across the different services by using retention policies and retention labels. Just one of these methods can be used, or they can be combined together.

This module explores how organizations can effectively manage or govern this information by using retention policies and retention label policies. You'll examine the capabilities found in each method, and you'll learn how policies differ depending on their scope.

The module will then review the principles of retention. These principles come into play when an item is subject to multiple retention settings that conflict with one another. When this situation occurs, you'll learn what takes precedence to determine the outcome.

The module concludes by examining how organizations use Preservation Lock to restrict users, including administrators, from turning off policies, deleting policies, and making policies less restrictive.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Explain how a retention policies and retention labels work.
 -  Identify the capabilities of both retention policies and retention labels.
 -  Select the appropriate scope for a policy depending on business requirements.
 -  Explain the principles of retention.
 -  Identify the differences between retention settings and eDiscovery holds.
 -  Restrict retention changes by using preservation lock.
