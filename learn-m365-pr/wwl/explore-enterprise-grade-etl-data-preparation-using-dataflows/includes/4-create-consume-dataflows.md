With dataflows, you can unify data from multiple sources and prepare that unified data for modeling. Whenever you create a dataflow, you're prompted to refresh the data for the dataflow. Refreshing a dataflow is required before it can be consumed in a dataset inside Power BI Desktop, or referenced as a linked or computed entity.

A dataflow can be consumed in the following three ways:

- Create a linked entity from the dataflow to allow another dataflow author to use the data

- Create a dataset from the dataflow to allow a user to utilize the data to create reports

- Create a connection from external tools that can read from the CDM format
