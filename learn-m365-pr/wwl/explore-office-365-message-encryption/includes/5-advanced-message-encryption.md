Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption is available on top of Office 365 Message Encryption in certain subscriptions, such as Office 365 Enterprise E5 and Office 365 Education A5. If your organization has an Office 365 subscription that doesn't include Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption, it can be purchased as an add-on with E5 Compliance of the Advanced Compliance SKU.

Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption offers extra capabilities on top of the standard Office 365 Message Encryption capabilities. To use these capabilities, recipients must view and reply to secure mail through the OME portal. The advanced capabilities include:

 -  Message revocation
 -  Message expiration
 -  Multiple branding templates

Advanced Message Encryption in Office 365 helps organizations meet compliance obligations that require more flexible control over external recipient's access to encrypted emails. As an administrator, Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption enables you to control sensitive emails shared outside the organization. You can do so with the use of:

 -  automatic policies that detect sensitive information types (such as financial or health information).
 -  keywords to enhance protection by expiring access through a secure web portal to encrypted emails.

Once you've configured the policies, you must pair them with custom branded email templates and then add an expiration date for extra control of emails that fit the policy. Admins can further control encrypted emails accessed externally through a secure web portal by revoking access to the mail at any time. Message revocation and expiration only work for emails that users send to recipients outside their Microsoft 365 organization. The recipients must access the email through the web portal.

Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption lets organizations create multiple branding templates so they can fine-tune control over recipient mail and create custom branding experiences to support a diverse organizational structure. Anytime a custom branding template is applied, Microsoft 365 applies a wrapper to email that fits the mail flow rule to which the template was applied. Organizations can only revoke messages and apply expiration dates to messages that users receive through the portal that have a custom branding template applied.
