The Process Explorer and Process Monitor tools are part of the Windows Sysinternals tool suite:

 -  Process Explorer. Enables you to determine the currently active processes on a Windows computer, and depending upon mode:
    
     -  Enables you to see the handles that the selected process has opened.
     -  Enables you to see the dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded.
 -  Process Monitor. This is an advanced tool for monitoring Windows that shows real-time file system, registry, and process/thread activity. Process Monitor includes monitoring and filtering capabilities.
