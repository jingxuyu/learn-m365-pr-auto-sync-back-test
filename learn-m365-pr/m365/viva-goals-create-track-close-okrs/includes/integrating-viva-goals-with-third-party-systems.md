Integrations allow Viva Goals to work seamlessly with third party systems to maximize efficiency and make it easy for users to engage with the system.

There are 2 main steps involved with setting up an integration.

- **Enable** - This is where your Admin enables the connection between Viva Goals and the outside data source or messaging platform.

- **Connect** - For data integrations, once the connection has been enabled, you will need to connect the outside data source to the **Key Result** or **Project** that is to be automatically updated.

### Data Integrations

Connections to outside data sources such as Azure Dev Ops and Excel allow Viva Goals to pull data from these systems.

An identified data point can be used to update the progress of your **Key Result** metric.

Viva Goals will sync every hour with the outside data source to ensure that you have the most up to date information.

To manually sync with the outside data source to receive the most up to date figure, select that icon and choose **Sync now**.

### Collaboration Integrations

Integrations with Collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams allows users to directly interact with Viva Goals.

You can receive your reminders to check-in via the collaboration platform and you are also able to update the progress of your **Key Results** directly from the platform.

This is called **Semi-Manual** check-in and eliminates the need for you to directly log into the system.
