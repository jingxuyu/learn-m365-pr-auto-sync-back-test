Miracast is a wireless, screen-mirroring protocol your PC can use to project your screen to TVs, projectors, and streaming media players that also support Miracast. You can use this to share what you are doing on your PC, present a slide show, or even play your favorite game on a larger screen. The main advantage of this technology is that users no longer have to search for the correct wire or cable since Miracast is Wi-Fi based technology. Presenters can now be disconnected, without wire, from their primary source of display. This provides freedom of movement and a more user-friendly presentation environment.

### Get your devices ready

In order to use Miracast, both the source and target device’s hardware and OS must support Miracast. Windows 8.1 and later devices support Miracast. Also, if the display you'll project to doesn’t support Miracast, you’ll need to plug a Miracast adapter (sometimes called a “hardware guard”) into the device's HDMI port. The device driver must also be the latest version, and the latest firmware must be installed for your wireless display, adapter, or docking station.

#### Add the display to complete the connection

With your PC and display ready to project, you need to add the wireless display to your PC. Both devices need to be within range, which usually means that they're in the same room.

To add a wireless display to your PC:

1.  Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap **Devices**. (If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then select **Devices**.)
2.  Tap or select **Project**, and then tap or select Add a wireless display.
3.  Choose the wireless display in the list of devices found, and follow the instructions on the screen.

#### Project your screen to a wireless display

After you add the wireless display to your PC, you can project your screen to it and change what you see on each screen.

To project your screen:

 -  Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap **Devices**. (If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then select **Devices**.)
 -  Tap or select **Project**, and then tap or select the wireless display you want.

To choose what you see on each screen:

1.  Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Devices. (If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then select Devices.)
2.  Tap or select **Project**, and then choose one of these options:
    
     -  **PC screen only**. You’ll see everything on your PC. (When you're connected to a wireless projector, this option changes to Disconnect.)
     -  **Duplicate**. You’ll see the same things on both screens.
     -  **Extend**. You'll see everything spread over both screens, and you can drag and move items between the two.
     -  **Second screen only**. You’ll see everything on the connected screen. Your other screen will be blank.

#### Disconnect from a wireless display

If you move your PC beyond the range of the wireless display (such as to another room), or if you make your PC sleep or hibernate, the two devices will disconnect. You can also disconnect the wireless display manually.

1.  Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap **Devices**. (If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then select **Devices**.)
2.  Tap or select **Project**, and then tap or select **Disconnect**.

### Fix problems

You can solve many problems by installing the latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter. To update firmware on your wireless display or adapter, go to the Support section of the manufacturer's website, search on your specific device, and follow their instructions to download and install that firmware. You can also check the Microsoft Store to see if there’s an app from the manufacturer of your wireless display or Miracast adapter that updates firmware.
