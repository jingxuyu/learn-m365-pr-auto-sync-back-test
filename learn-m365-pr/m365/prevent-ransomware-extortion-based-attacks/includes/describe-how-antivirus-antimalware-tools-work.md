Malware is malicious software that aims to cause damage to data and corrupt a system. A virus is a type of malware that replicates itself and spreads between devices or a network and behaves in any way the attacker wants.

There are various ways to safeguard your data and devices against such malicious content. One method is to install antivirus or antimalware software.

In this unit, you'll learn about how these tools work.

## What is an antivirus?

Antivirus is a tool or piece of software that detects and deletes any viruses and prevents them from spreading to other systems or devices. After installation, it mostly runs in the background and scans the system for any malicious behavior and threats, so providing real-time protection against virus attacks.

Antivirus programs receive automatic updates which help to safeguard your devices. You either schedule scans for it to run automatically, or you can initiate a new scan at any time. You can also run a scan for a particular file, a USB drive, or a CD. Antivirus programs notify you of a threat and suggest any required actions.

## What is antimalware?

Antimalware is a more comprehensive protection program than antivirus. It safeguards the system and network against various malware, including worms, Trojan horses, bots, rootkits, spyware, phishing, ransomware, and adware. You can install antimalware on a network device, a personal computer, or gateway server.

An antimalware program identifies malware on your device and eliminates it efficiently. It then cleans up the damage caused by the malware attack. Sometimes antimalware software is used alongside antivirus software to provide a broader coverage against threats and spam.

## How does antimalware work?

Antimalware uses various techniques for scanning and removing malware. Some of them are explained below:

### Signature-based detection

Signature-based detection is a way of using a set of known malware components, also called signatures, to scan for malicious content. These digital signatures detect new potential malware and recognize any previously identified malware. This type of antimalware program helps to flag common malware, such as keyloggers and adware. It's important to keep your antimalware program up-to-date to achieve maximum security.

### Behavior-based identification

This is a technique where an antimalware program identifies malware based on how it behaves. It's quicker than signature-based malware detection because it doesn't scan or compare the file to any known threats. It identifies malware based on its character and behavior. If it detects suspicious behavior, antimalware programs flag it as a potential threat.

### Sandboxing

Antimalware software uses sandboxing to isolate malicious files. This technique separates the suspicious file and holds it in a sandbox environment to further scrutinize it, blocking access to any system or applications. For example, while opening a suspicious file, the antimalware moves it to a virtual environment, allowing it limited access to the resources. If found to be malicious, sandbox can block or terminate it.

However, some sophisticated malware can trick the antimalware software so that it doesn't appear to be malicious while in a sandbox environment.

### Malware removal

Antimalware programs don't just identify the malware, they also automatically terminate it and block it from spreading and infecting the applications. Sometimes, malware removal tools quarantine certain files. For example, if a system file is infected by a virus, deleting it will cause further damage. In such a case, the safer option is to move the file to quarantine. Quarantining a file means relocating and isolating it to clean and make it virus free.

## Why do you need antivirus/antimalware?

Malware removal software scans for any malicious content and prevents it from infecting your applications and devices. It provides advanced protection from sophisticated malware and ransomware attacks. A malware removal tool aims to always safeguard your network and devices. Some of the benefits for installing malware removal tools are:

- **Protecting from attackers**: An antimalware tool alerts you if a website contains malware. It blocks attackers from gaining access to networks and appliances.
- **Safeguarding privacy**: Antimalware software safeguards your personal data. It prevents cybercriminals from stealing and misusing your personal information.
- **Securing critical data and files**: A malware removal tool keeps your critical data and files secure by ensuring robust protection against malware and viruses while browsing the internet.
- **Keeping software up-to-date**: Because new viruses are continually being devised, it's crucial to keep your security software up-to-date. Malware removal software automatically provides the latest updates and versions.
- **Cleaning up devices**: Antimalware software notifies you when unnecessary files are stored on your apps and devices. It recommends you delete junk files and free up space.
