Management of user data is a balance between simplifying how users store their data while also protecting it. Libraries provide a simple interface that allows users to store data based on a category. On the back-end, IT can define the location of this data. OneDrive provides a solution for allowing users to store and access their data as they've done in the past, while offering the protection of cloud-based storage. Work folders provide a similar solution using Windows Server as a centralized host for user files.
