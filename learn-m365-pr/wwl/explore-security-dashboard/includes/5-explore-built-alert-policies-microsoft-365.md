Microsoft 365 provides built-in alert policies that help identify Exchange admin permissions abuse, malware activity, and data governance risks. On the **Alert policies** page, the names of these built-in policies are in bold and the policy type is defined as **System**. These policies are turned on by default. You can turn off these policies (or back on again), set up a list of recipients to send email notifications to, and set a daily notification limit. The other settings for these policies can't be edited.

The following table identifies the available default alert policies.
