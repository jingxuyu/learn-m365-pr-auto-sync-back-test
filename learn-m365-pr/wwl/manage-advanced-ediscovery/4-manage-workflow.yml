quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson has created an Advanced eDiscovery case to address a legal issue facing the company. What should Holly do to preserve any content that's relevant to the case?"
    choices:
    - content: "Send a legal hold notice to the custodians"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A legal hold notice instructs custodians to preserve any content that's relevant to the case. Legal teams must track the notices that have been received, read, and confirmed by custodians."
    - content: "Index custodian data by using the process known as Advanced indexing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This process enables custodial content such as images, unsupported file types, and other potentially unindexed content to be fully searchable when you run searches to collect data for the case. Try again."
    - content: "Create searches to search the in-place custodial and non-custodial data sources in Microsoft 365 for content relevant to the case"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While Holly will eventually create searches to search for content relevant to the case, this action isn't what Holly should do to preserve the relevant content in the first place. Try again."
