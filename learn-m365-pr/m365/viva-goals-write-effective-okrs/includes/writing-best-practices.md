The OKR goal setting framework enables companies to define their strategy, align top to bottom, and achieve amazing results. However, while the concept is straightforward, the odds of implementing a successful OKR program are often directly tied to the quality of the OKRs that you've written.

In this unit we'll establish the foundation for crafting high quality OKRs by reviewing:

- Definitions
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls

## Definitions

OKR is an acronym that stands for "Objectives" and "Key Results." Key Initiatives/Projects are the elements that underpin the Key Results.

- **Objectives** are the goal you want to achieve. They ask, "Where do we want to go?" and the answers are **actionable**, **aspirational**, and **meaningful**.
- **Key Results** are how you'll achieve your goal. They ask, "How will we know we're getting there?" and the answers are **focused**, **measurable**, and **ambitious**. Key Results are OUTCOMES.
- **Key Initiatives/Projects** are focused efforts that help you achieve your Key Results. They ask, "What do we have to do to get there?" and the answers result in a list of tasks. Key Initiatives/Projects are OUTPUTS.

### Objectives

Starting with Objectives, we're trying to answer, "Where do we want to go?" In other words, what meaningful action are you trying to accomplish? Picture the following:

- Your best friend is asking, "What exciting projects are you taking on at work?" What would you say?
- Or say you had just a few minutes to communicate to your employees, "What is preventing us from achieving success, and what are we going to do about it?" What would those items be?

The answers to these questions will identify areas of focus that you can transform into Objectives. While it might be tempting to list out all the projects you want to tackle, we want to limit ourselves to 3-5 items, leveraging the superpower of "focus."

### Key Results

With Key Results, we're trying to answer, "How will we know we're getting there?" In other words, how can we measure if we were successful? Picture the following:

- If Objectives are the inspiring words of a Leader, Key Results would be the specific numbers of a Scientist.
- If your best friend asked if you accomplished your ambitious goal, the results should be clear, measurable, and not open to interpretation.

Key Results are owned by a single person or group who is responsible for achieving the metric. Just like with Objectives, Key Results should be limited to 3-5 measures.

### Key Initiatives/Projects

With Key Initiatives/Projects we're trying to answer, "What do we have to do to get there?" In other words, what are the tasks or tactics that we need to undertake in order to achieve the Key Result?

- Ask yourself: What could get in the way of our Projects and Key Initiatives?
- Stay realistically optimistic. Make sure you have the ability (resources and timeline) to execute the Projects and Key Initiatives under your OKRs.

Key Initiatives/Projects are often delegated, and when they're delegated, they can become the Objectives or Projects of someone else.

With that baseline, let's also look at what OKRs are NOT.

- They aren't unrealistic or ambiguous goals
- They're not a task list or to-do list (these are Key Initiatives/Projects, and they underpin your Objectives/Key Results)
- They're not so overly specific as to be constraining

## Understand the ORK mindset and best practices

There are a few things to keep in mind as you begin or expand upon your OKR journey, and these can be divided into two groups: The OKR Mindset and Best Practices.

### The OKR Mindset

1. **Remember your "Why"**

    What brought you to the OKR framework? It could be providing better transparency across your organization, aligning remote workers around a common goal, or spearheading a new product launch. Be clear why OKRs are important to your organization.
1. **Communicate clearly**

    Once you know your "why," you'll want to communicate it clearly. Employees will take their lead from senior leadership, so make sure there's top-down support, the right team is in place, people know their roles, and OKRs are being referenced in key meetings.
1. **Be patient**

    Lastly, while OKRs will ultimately streamline your business functions, be patient with results. Successful adoption will take several quarters to get right, you can expect some bumps in the road, experience frustration writing and aligning OKRs, and find some employees resistant to change. But be patient and stick with it.

### Best practices

1. **Top down, bottom up**

    Before you even get to your OKRs, you should be starting with your company's overall Mission, Vision, and Values. What is your company's reason for being? What motivates and inspires you? What is your sense of purpose? Being clear on this will help inform the strategy and direction you want to take.

    From there, senior leadership should start with a top-down approach, taking ownership and defining annual Objectives. These will then cascade down through Key Results throughout the organization.

    However, at a certain point you need to incorporate bottom-up input to fuel the specifics of your business. These individual employees are vital to communicating the critical day-to-day Key Results or Key Initiatives/Projects that will contribute back up to the overall mission of the company.
1. **Think long term, then short term**

    The most common time frame for goal setting is to first set long term goals to allow for a broader, more aspirational focus. Then, break out those goals into shorter segments to give enough time for projects that will take more than a few weeks, but are short enough to allow real progress to be made.
1. **Keep it simple**

    At every point in the OKR process, we urge you to keep things as simple as possible. Companies that struggle are the ones that try to do too much, too fast. Brainstorm the top 12 - 15 ideas you'd like to get accomplished, but then ruthlessly cut the list in half, and if possible, cut some more, limiting yourself to 3-5 Objectives, and 3-5 Key Results for each one.

    In short, "Do less, accomplish more."

## Common pitfalls

Some common mistakes when just starting out include:

- Approaching OKRs as "business as usual" projects, that don't have an impact on your business.
- Writing Key Results that aren't measurable, so defining progress is vague.
- Creating too many Objectives or Key Results and losing focus.

Avoiding these common mistakes will set you up for success.
