As with any cloud-based service offering, Microsoft 365 subscriptions come with a guaranteed amount of uptime in terms of a percentage of service availability over a given period (such as a 99 percent available uptime average over the period of one year). The details of the guarantee vary from one cloud service provider to another and are detailed in a legal agreement between a cloud service provider and the customer, known as a **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**. 

In addition to your CSP’s SLA, Microsoft offers Microsoft 365 subscribers a Microsoft Online Services Agreement that documents our commitment to achieve and maintain service levels for each service.

## SLA considerations

Make sure you thoroughly review any service agreement before you sign it. Although the cloud has much to offer, it’s still like any other network, server, or on-premises service - an unforeseen problem or disaster can cause the service to be unavailable. 

When reviewing the agreement, ask yourself the following questions:

- How does the CSP determine whether service levels are being achieved?
- Who's responsible for measurement, and how can I obtain reports?
- What exceptions are there in the SLA?
- When the SLA is not met, what’s the remedy for the deficiencies?
- What happens when maintenance (both scheduled and emergency) is performed?
- What happens when a malicious hacker targets my organizations or the infrastructure that we’re running on, and the result is downtime? 
- What happens when third-party system failures or services are not under the vendor’s control?
- What happens if the service is brought down by acts of war or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, storms, tornadoes, or hurricanes?
- What limits to the CSP’s liability are stated in the SLA?
