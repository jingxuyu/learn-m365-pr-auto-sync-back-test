This module examined how Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data from its customers to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly. This data is also used by Microsoft to improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services.

This module introduced you to a Windows 10 component named Connected User Experiences and Telemetry. This component is the primary tool that Microsoft uses to gather and store diagnostic data events and data. Windows diagnostic data is vital technical data from Windows 10 devices about the devices and how Windows and related software are doing.

The module then examined how organizations can control the extent of diagnostic data that's shared with Microsoft by selecting the level of diagnostic data they want to use. Microsoft, in turn, uses that data to:

 -  identify security and reliability issues.
 -  analyze and fix software problems.
 -  help improve the quality of Windows and related services.
 -  make design decisions for future releases.

Windows 10 diagnostic data is also used by cloud services such as Desktop Analytics and Microsoft Defender for Advanced Threat Protection. This module examined Windows Desktop Analytics. It's a free, cloud-based service that provides data driven insights, or analytics, about your devices. Desktop Analytics uses the diagnostic data captured by the Connected User Experiences and Telemetry component in Windows 10.

In this module, you explored three of the primary components of Desktop Analytics:

 -  Device Health, which analyzes a device's performance and reliability health.
 -  Update Compliance, which analyzes how up to date a device is based on software quality updates, feature updates, and anti-virus updates.
 -  Upgrade Readiness, which analyzes a device's preparedness to run a Windows 10 upgrade.
