Part of planning and designing your virtual summit is choosing the right type of virtual event. Microsoft 365 supports three distinct options: Teams meetings, webinars, and live events. 

In this unit, you'll learn when to use each option, based on your audience and the kind of content you're presenting.  If you've completed the [Introduction to delivering virtual events with Microsoft 365](/learn/modules/m365-introduction-deliver-virtual-events-using-microsoft-teams) module, you have a basic understanding of the different types of events. Now we'll dig into how to choose the right experience for your event.


## Select your event experience

The best tool to use for your event depends on the experience you want for your attendees. The table shows the elements to consider:

:::image type="complex" source="../media/select-experience-matrix.png" alt-text="Grid to select from":::

The table has four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

Under the columns are three rows. These cells are Single event, Event series, Part of an engagement community, Open two-way discussion, up to 300, and simple webcam and screen share.

### Teams meeting

The table has four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

Under the columns are three rows. In each row, there are cells highlighted in blue, which show the kind of experience best supported by Microsoft Teams. These cells are Single event, Event series, Part of an engagement community, Open two-way discussion, up to 300, and simple webcam and screen share.

        </div>
    
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::

        For virtual events with up to 1,000 people and where the presenters use their own webcams and screen sharing, Microsoft recommends Teams meetings. Teams supports:

        - Open discussions via audio and video for attendees.
        - Interactive chat & multiple presenters.
        - Supports the use of Microsoft Yammer as part of a community experience or series of continuing conversations.

    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::

        For virtual events with up to 20,000 people and where the presenters use their own webcams and screen sharing, Microsoft recommends using Teams webinars. Webinars support all of the Teams meetings functions and adds:

        - Registration process for attendees - collect information before your event to enable you to tailor it to your audience.
        - Registration and attendance reports can be downloaded to review engagement.
        - Attendee video and audio is muted on entry by default.
        - More controls for the presenter.

### Live event

:::image type="complex" source="../media/live-event-experience.png" alt-text="Table showing experience that is best supported by Live Events.":::

This is the same table with four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

There are then three rows under it. There are cells highlighted in blue, which show the kind of experience best supported by Live Events. These cells are Single event, Event series, shaded Part of an engagement community, Managed Q & A, No attendee discussion or Q&A, Up to 20,000 and 100,000 people, multiple presenters, and Custom production.

:::image-end:::

:::row:::

    :::column:::

        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/live-event-logo.png" alt-text="Microsoft Teams logo" border="false":::

        Recommended: **Live events**
        </div>

        
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::

        For your virtual events that are up to 100,000 people and you need more custom video production, Microsoft recommends live events. Live events support:

        - Broad scale and highly managed content.
        - Maximum flexibility and choice of tools.
        - Form part of a larger engagement community.
        - Live events are supported in Teams, Yammer, or Stream.

### Which live event experience should you use

If you've decided that a live event is the right choice for your virtual event, you still have a choice on the tools you can use: Teams, Yammer, or Stream.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/live-events-decision-matrix.png" alt-text="A decision matrix that guides the reader through choosing Teams, Yammer, or Stream for your Live Event.":::

This diagram has two paths, if you'll have up to 20,000 people - 10,000 after December 31, 2021 - or you've up to 100,000. For the 20,000 path, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 and no attendee discussion and custom video production then Live Events with Stream is the better option.

:::image-end:::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> \* Attendee limit increases over 10,000 are temporarily available until December 31, 2021.
> \*\* Stream live events are generally only delivered inside your organization.

Using this decision matrix you can see that for events with up to 20,000 attendees, Teams Live Events is a good choice, especially if you need to include people external to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal only events with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 with no attendee discussion and custom video production, then live events with Stream is the best option. Remember that Streams can only be used outside your organization with the support of your event from the Live Events Assistance Program (LEAP) team.

## Combination events

Having read about all the different event scenarios and meeting options, you'll see that many events will use a combination of all the above. For example, your summit, may call for a mix of keynotes and multiple, small breakout sessions that support different content tracks. Attendees will likely use Teams to participate in all sessions. Your keynote will use a heavily customized production, using a broadcast-quality video studio with highly moderated chat and Q&A. The content will also be recorded and made available to stream offline by all attendees. For the breakout sessions, attendees will be allowed to share their own content and videos, and the moderators will encourage two-way conversations.
