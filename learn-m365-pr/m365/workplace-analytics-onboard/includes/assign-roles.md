- The **Microsoft 365 admin** assigns Workplace Analytics licenses to user mailboxes and an applicable Workplace Analytics role to these users. This role doesn't have access to the Workplace Analytics app (unless they assign themselves an applicable role, such as an analyst role).
- The **Workplace Analytics admin** sets system defaults and privacy settings for your company's Workplace Analytics and Viva Insights environment and is responsible for uploading and verifying the organizational (HR) data. This role can access **Data sources**, **Leader & manager settings**, and **Analyst settings**.
- A **Workplace Analytics analyst** has full access to all Workplace Analytics features (except **Upload** in **Data sources** and other admin-only settings) and can directly query the full dataset. This role is typically assigned to analysts who need complete data access to perform their analyses.
- A **Workplace Analytics analyst (limited)** has similar access as analysts with the following exceptions:
  - No access to **Query designer**
  - Read-only access to **Analyst settings**

To get started with Workplace Analytics, your Microsoft 365 admin must assign one or more users the roles of Workplace Analytics admin and analyst.

>[!NOTE]
>Only people with an assigned Workplace Analytics role can access and use the Workplace Analytics web app and its features.
