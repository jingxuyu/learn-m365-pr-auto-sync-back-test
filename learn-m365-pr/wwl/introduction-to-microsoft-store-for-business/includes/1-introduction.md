Different vendors have different ways to distribute apps for their devices. Modern Windows apps are available through Microsoft Store, where anyone can purchase the app and install it on their Windows device. With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Store for Business, which is designed for organizations of all sizes.

Microsoft Store for Business enables organizations to set up a private store. Private stores are only available to company employees. The private store can include publicly available, business-related apps that were purchased from the Microsoft Store for Business. It can also include modern Windows apps that were developed for the organization and are only available to company employees.

Microsoft Store for Business includes basic distribution abilities that enable you to assign apps to organizational users. It also tracks licensing. If a user doesn't have a license for the app, the user can't run it.
