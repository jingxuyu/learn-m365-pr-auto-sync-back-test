      explanation: "That's incorrect. This technology won't enable you to prevent your users from running unsafe apps."
  - content: "You want to ensure that users of Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and a custom app that your company uses cannot access a specific custom domain on the internet. Which attack surface reduction capability should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Network protection"

    - content: "Hardware-based isolation"

    - content: "Web protection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Web protection can be applied to web browsers but not custom apps."
  - content: "When an attack surface reduction rule triggers, you want to record the event for later analysis but permit that action to continue without prompting the user. What mode should you configure?"
    choices:
    - content: "Block mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In block mode, the action that triggered the rule is not permitted."
    - content: "Warn mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In warn mode, the action is blocked although the user sees a prompt and can choose to continue with it."
    - content: "Audit mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In audit mode, the event is logged but the action is permitted to continue."
