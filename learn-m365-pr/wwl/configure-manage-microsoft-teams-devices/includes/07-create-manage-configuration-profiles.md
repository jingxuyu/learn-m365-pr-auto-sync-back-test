Organizations can use configuration profiles to manage settings and features for their Teams devices. Administrators can either manually create profiles in Microsoft Teams or upload existing configuration profiles. Profiles include the settings and features that administrators want to enable or disable. They can then assign a profile to a device or groups of devices.

## Create a configuration profile

Complete the following steps to create a configuration profile for a Teams device type:

1. Navigate to the Teams admin center. 
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Devices**, and then select the specific Teams device type that you want to configure (for example, IP phones, Collaboration bars, Teams displays, or Teams panels).
1. In the window that appears for the device type you selected, select **Configuration profiles** on the list of tabs at the top of the page.
1. On the menu bar, select **+Add**.
1. In the **Configuration profile** window, enter a name for the profile and optionally add a friendly description.
1. Specify the settings you want for the profile, and then select **Save**.
   The newly created configuration profile will be displayed in the list of profiles.
