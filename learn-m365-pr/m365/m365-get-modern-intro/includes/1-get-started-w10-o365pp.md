Windows 10 + Microsoft 365 Apps managed by Microsoft's EMS provide an always-up-to-date environment with insights and security powered by the cloud. Modernizing your systems and software takes some planning. You need to identify the tools that work best for your specific environment and understand how your business apps will work in a modern environment. You will need to share your migration plans with your employees, as there are a lot of moving parts. The **desktop deployment wheel** guides you through the recommended upgrade steps, detailing how to leverage your existing tools and processes while adopting modern management technology and approaches.

In this first Getting Started module, we'll look at the key steps to plan your update deployment to Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Apps. You'll notice that the deployment process itself has improved with new tooling and insights, making past upgrading challenges such as application compatibility less of an issue.
