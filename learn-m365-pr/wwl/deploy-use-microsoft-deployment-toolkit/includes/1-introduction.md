There are several on-premises methods that have been traditionally used to facilitate OS deployments within organizations. While newer cloud-based solutions have frequently simplified many methods and processes, on-premises tools still have a place in modern management. In this module, we’ll discuss these shifts from traditional to modern management, and where on-premises solutions best fit in today’s enterprise.
