The Intelligent Security Graph uses advanced analytics to link a massive amount of threat intelligence and security data from Microsoft and partners to combat cyberthreats. Insights from the Intelligent Security Graph power real-time threat protection in Microsoft products and services.



## Microsoft Graph Security API

In addition to providing threat information to Microsoft's products and services, insights from the Intelligent Security Graph power the Graph Security API, which developers can leverage to build intelligent security services.

The Microsoft Graph Security API is a unified API that provides a standard interface and uniform schema to integrate security alerts and threat intelligence from multiple sources, enriches alerts and data with contextual information, and automates security operations.

The security API is part of the Microsoft Graph, a unified REST API for integrating data and intelligence from Microsoft and partner products and services. Using Microsoft Graph, customers and partners can rapidly build solutions that authenticate once and use a single API call to access or act on security insights from multiple security solutions. By exploring other Microsoft Graph entities (such as Azure Active Directory, Intune, and more), you can discover additional value and security insights.

## Azure Sentinel

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Defender is the new name for Microsoft Threat Protection. 

Microsoft 365 Defender solutions integrate with Azure Sentinel.  Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, **security information event management (SIEM)** and **security orchestration automated response (SOAR)** solution.  Azure Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

* Collect data at cloud scale across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and in multiple clouds.
* Detect previously undetected threats, and minimize false positives using Microsoft's analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence. 
* Investigate threats with artificial intelligence, and hunt for suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cyber security work at Microsoft. 
* Respond to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.
