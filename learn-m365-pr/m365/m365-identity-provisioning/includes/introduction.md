Identity management is the process of authenticating identities. This might services, applications, users, or groups. Microsoft identity and access management solutions use Azure AD to protect access to applications and resources across the organizationâ€™s datacenter and into the cloud. 

By using the security capabilities of Azure AD, you can: 

* Create and manage a single identity for each user across your hybrid enterprise, keeping users, groups, and devices in sync. 

* Provide single sign-on (SSO) access to your applications, including thousands of pre-integrated SaaS apps. 

* Enable application access security by enforcing rules-based Multi-Factor Authentication for both on-premises and cloud applications. 

* Provision secure remote access to on-premises web applications through Azure AD Application Proxy.
