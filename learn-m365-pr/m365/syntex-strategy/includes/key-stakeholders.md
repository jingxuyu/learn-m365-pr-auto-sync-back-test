For your next step, you need Contoso Electronics’ management and teams on your side. Getting buy in from your organization’s key stakeholders is necessary for employing SharePoint Syntex. Companies thrive when all the necessary parties are aligned and aware of how they can use SharePoint Syntex to contribute to the success of their organization’s content understanding processes.

Here, you will learn which stakeholders you should approach with your proposal for adopting SharePoint Syntex.  

Identify your company’s stakeholders

Executive/Leadership

‘Buy-in’ and endorsement at the executive level ensures that all other stakeholders are invested in SharePoint Syntex and aligned on the greater goal or mission of implementing efficient content understanding. Leadership will already have a clear idea of what the entire company’s goals and values are, allowing them to align implementing SharePoint Syntex with these more easily and clearly. And of course, much of the company looks to the executive team for direction and trusts their buy in, making it easier to adopt and support SharePoint Syntex throughout the entire company.  

You may make your proposal to your CEO or Chief Operating Officer. With the executive team’s endorsement and support, SharePoint Syntex is one major step closer to implementation. Leadership could also potentially be on a smaller scale, depending on the organization’s size, such as the IT administrator.

Once your CEO or COO is invested in taking advantage of SharePoint Syntex, they can begin speaking to the rest of your company about SharePoint Syntex’s benefits.

Champions

Product champions advocate for SharePoint Syntex rollout. The champions drive other stakeholders forward and help ingrain content understanding processes into your organization, making them an accepted norm.  

Your SharePoint SharePoint Syntex champions need a basic understanding of how the solution works. They should be able to speak to the aims and goals of applying it. This understanding will allow them to answer any questions or objections that may arise from other members of the organization. Change can be met with questioning, so being able to meet these questions with answers and a clear understanding can be crucial.  

At Contoso Electronics, all your stakeholders should ideally be champions. Executives, project leads, knowledge admins, and model owners are close enough to the initiative that they can actively endorse rollout. However, in this scenario at Contoso Electronic, the users who stand to benefit from the results of a SharePoint Syntex rollout might be the ultimate champions.  

With the leadership team onboard and champions evangelizing for SharePoint Syntex, you’re ready to present your proposal to the next critical set of stakeholders:

Project leads

The project lead is the person or team that manages the deployment of SharePoint Syntex and then the launch of content understanding. They will need a solid understanding of Contoso Electronics’ goal in adopting SharePoint Syntex. They will require insight into what is involved to make that happen. Project leads ensure that all the other stakeholders are identified and brought into communication channels. As the project gets underway, the project lead makes certain that identified roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.  

A project lead will need to be someone familiar with project management and have an all-encompassing view of your organization’s structure. In this scenario, you have been acting as project lead to this point. Once your proposal for applying SharePoint Syntex to Contoso Electronic’s disorganized content libraries gets the green light, you may decide to pass the project lead baton to someone from your project management team.  

Contoso Electronics decided on a phased roll out of SharePoint Syntex. After much discussion, the Human Resources department was identified for the first phase. Now the project team should nominate personnel for the SharePoint Syntex roles and responsibilities. Each of those people will need to be brought into the larger project team as stakeholders. This gives them familiarity with SharePoint Syntex and allows them to begin learning their new roles and responsibilities early.

Since the Knowledge admin creates content centers, they need to know how they should be structured (i.e., how many, for which departments, etc.) They also manage security and access privileges. Your project team identifies someone from IT to take on the role.

The Human Resources manager identifies an admin in the HR department who volunteered for the Content manager/model owner role. This person will work closely with the project lead to understand the goals set forth by the project leads.

An IT admin wanted to take on the role of Power Platform admin. This person will coordinate applying AI builder to Human Resource’s libraries.
