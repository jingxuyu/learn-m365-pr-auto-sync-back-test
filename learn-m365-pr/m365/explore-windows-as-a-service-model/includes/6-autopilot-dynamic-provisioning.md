## Windows Autopilot
With Windows Autopilot you can customize the out-of-box experience (OOBE) for your organization’s Windows 10 computers. Windows Autopilot offers the following advantages over on-premises deployment methods: 
- You don't need to use images. 
- You don't need to customize the deployments by injecting drivers. 
- You don't need to deploy and maintain a deployment infrastructure. 

Windows Autopilot is cloud-driven and based around Azure AD Premium, the Microsoft Store for Business, and/or Microsoft Intune. Using Windows Autopilot, you can:

- Join devices to Azure AD automatically.
- Auto-enroll your users’ devices into MDM services.
- Restrict Administrator account creation.
- Customize the OOBE experience specifically for your organization.

## Dynamic provisioning scenarios
The aim of dynamic provisioning is to avoid the need for replacing the initial operating system with a pre-configured image. Instead, the device is provisioned and updated automatically to fit specific use cases. 

- Subscription Activation
- Azure AD / MDM
- Provisioning packages
