## What’s changed and why upgrade?
### What's changed?
Here are some of the core changes to Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus:

**Identity and access management.** Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus have a new Identity and Access Management service at their core: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD. This enables single sign-on and secure connectivity across your cloud services, meaning  you’re going to need Azure AD to take advantage of Microsoft 365 services such as Office 365, Intune, or Windows Autopilot.

**Secure pre-boot environment.** Sixty-four-bit UEFI  firmware replaces BIOS in Windows 10 which not only speeds up boot times, but is required to enable many of the modern security capabilities in Windows 10. While Windows 10 will run on BIOS, UEFI is strongly recommended, and there are tools to help you make this switch either during or after a Windows 10 upgrade.

**Cloud-based device management.** Services like Microsoft Intune help you manage your Windows 10 devices as you use other mobile devices, all from one place. What makes Microsoft Intune unique is the ability to co-manage your Windows 10 devices with System Center Configuration Manager. You can use System Center Configuration Manager to help you in your shift to Windows 10, and then add Microsoft Intune.  

**Cloud-based deployment service.** As you acquire new PCs, we’ve introduced a new cloud service to help you deploy Microsoft 365 devices, called the Windows Autopilot deployment service. Autopilot is integrated with your hardware providers and new PCs are automatically registered in Autopilot. This enables the new PC to be shipped directly to the end-user. When the PC is powered on the first time it is quickly configured to your organization’s desired configuration and customized for the specific needs of the user.

**Click-to-Run deployments.** When provisioning Office desktop apps, Office 365 ProPlus is the preferred option  for giving you access to the newest innovations in Office as they are developed. Office 365 ProPlus uses a new installation called Click-to-Run which is different from the MSI-based packages of the past. Click-to-Run is faster, lighter, and supports updates in the background to keep your users up and running. It is still a local copy of Office and you can continue to use your existing deployment tools, like System Center Configuration Manager, to provision and configure the apps.

**Semi-annual updates.** Once you have moved to Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus, updates are delivered semi-annually with new features. With Microsoft able to deliver diagnostic data from the cloud to help, you can quickly and confidently roll out these updates to hundreds or thousands of devices to meet your organization’s update compliance timelines.

### Why upgrade?
if you haven’t shifted your desktop environment in a while, you’re probably using Windows 7 and Office 2010 or Office 2013. In addition to all the advantages of the core changes above, the deployment process itself has improved with new tooling and insights, making past challenges such as application compatibility less of an issue today.
