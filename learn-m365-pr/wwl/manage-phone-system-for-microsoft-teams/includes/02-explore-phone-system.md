Teams Phone is Microsoft's technology for enabling call control and Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities in the Microsoft 365 cloud with Microsoft Teams. It works with Teams clients and certified devices, allowing you to replace your existing PBX system with a set of features directly delivered from Microsoft 365.

With Teams Phone, users can use Teams to place, receive, and transfer calls using their mobile devices, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones that work with Teams.

Teams Phone provides many key capabilities to help an organizationâ€™s users to be productive and collaborate in a protected way. These methods include call sharing, protected voicemail, number blocking, and more.

## Connect to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
Teams Phone can be connected to the PSTN in one of several ways:
* **Purchase a Microsoft Calling Plan.** Microsoft Calling Plan is an all-in-the-cloud solution with Microsoft as your PSTN carrier.

* **Use your existing telephony infrastructure for on-premises PSTN connectivity.**            You can connect your on-premises telephony infrastructure to Teams Phone by using Operator Connect Calling or Direct Routing.

## Teams Phone services

The followings are the key features of Teams Phone:

* **Auto attendants and Call queues** - Auto attendants enable an organization to set up menu options to route calls based on caller input. Call queues are waiting areas for callers. Used together, auto attendants and call queues can easily route callers to the appropriate person or department in an organization.

* **Cloud Voicemail** - Cloud Voicemail, powered by Azure Voicemail services, supports voicemail deposits to Exchange mailboxes only. Cloud Voicemail is automatically set up and provisioned for online-only users after they're assigned a Teams Phone license.

* **Calling identity** - By default, all outbound calls use the assigned phone number as calling identity (caller ID). With Teams Phone, a detailed caller ID can be displayed that pulls information from the corporate directory when calling from inside the company, showing picture ID and job title instead of just a phone number.
