You work for a Woodgrove, a large financial organization. A recent report revealed that 20% of Windows 10 devices are either out of support or nearing the end of support. As a result, some devices that perform critical business functions are not receiving security updates and are at greater risk of security threats and performance issues. Previously you've helped your organization create a plan for how it can stay current with Windows 10. As the Windows servicing process manager, you now want to use the plan to help your organization prepare for the Windows 10 feature update.

In this module, you'll learn how you can use the Windows servicing process to help your organization prepare its environment for the latest Windows feature updates. By the end of this module, you'll understand how your organization can prepare the capability, compatibility, deployment, and modernization workstreams, so it can successfully move to the Deploy phase.
