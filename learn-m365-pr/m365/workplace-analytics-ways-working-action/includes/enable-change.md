## What is MyAnalytics?

MyAnalytics generates data regarding two of the key factors in personal productivity: how people spend their time and who they spend it with. MyAnalytics presents you with insights through these tools:

- **MyAnalytics dashboard**. The dashboard shows how you spent your time over the past month, productivity insights about your work patterns, helpful suggestions for improvement, and information about your network, top collaborators, and collaboration activities.
- **Outlook Insights add-in**. The Insights add-in for Outlook presents you with activity cards that are based on your recent work experience with options to respond or follow up, based on the activity.
- **Weekly Digests**. Receive a weekly digest that gives you highlights about your previous week.
- **Inline suggestions in Outlook**. See contextual data-driven recommendations to improve your work patterns.

### Access your MyAnalytics dashboard

Users can access their personal MyAnalytics dashboard by visiting myanalytics.microsoft.com. The MyAnalytics dashboard shows you statistics about your work patterns over the past month. Statistics include your focus and collaboration time, how many days you were able to disconnect from work, and how effectively you're networking with your coworkers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information available in the MyAnalytics dashboard is private and personal metrics are only available for individual access. Users will need the appropriate Microsoft 365 license to access this dashboard.

Finally, *educational cards* give you work productivity and wellbeing tips. MyAnalytics refreshes these cards periodically to reflect your most recent work patterns.

## What are plans?

You can use the plans feature of Workplace Analytics to create improvement plans for employees, with the goal of changing their work habits for the better. By using the plans feature, you can:

- Identify groups whose workplace effectiveness could be improved.
- Set up 12-week plans for the identified group.
- Measure the progress of the plan while it's underway.

If you have the analyst, limited analyst, or program manager role, you can open Workplace Analytics and select **Plans > New Plan**. There you can learn about the types of plans that you can create.

:::image type="content" source="../media/learn-types-plans.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the different plan types." lightbox="../media/learn-types-plans.png":::

You can then either select a known group of employees to enroll in the plan or use analysis to find a group of employees to enroll. After enrolling participants in a plan, you can track their progress on key metrics over time.

In addition to its standard weekly digest, the digest for plan participants includes a section that summarizes their progress in the plan. They can visit their MyAnalytics dashboard to see a page dedicated to their enrolled plan.

:::image type="content" source="../media/program-checkpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the program checkpoint where data is summarized to show individual progress in the plan.":::

## What are Insights for people managers?

Insights for people managers provide managers with behavioral measures of employee experience and team effectiveness. Managers can leverage a dashboard to track progress, view suggested actions, and launch a plan for their team.

> [!NOTE]
> Managers cannot access data on individuals. Managers who are assigned access can only see data on their team in an aggregate view. The default group size threshold is ten, including the manager.

Here's the Insights for people managers **Home** page:

:::image type="content" source="../media/insights-people-managers-home.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Insights for people managers Home page" lightbox="../media/insights-people-managers-home.png":::

Here's some examples of how you can track progress:
