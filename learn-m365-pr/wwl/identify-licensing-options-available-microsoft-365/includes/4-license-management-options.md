### Licenses

A **license** allows your users to use the features and services included in the subscription plan. Microsoft 365 products and services are available as **user subscription licenses (USLs)** and are licensed on a per-user basis. The following list describes the options available:

 -  **Full USLs** are for new customers who haven't previously purchased Microsoft products and services.
 -  **Add-on USLs** are for on-premises software customers who want to add Microsoft 365 cloud products and services.
 -  **From SA USLs** are for on-premises Software Assurance customers that want to transition to the cloud.
 -  **Step Up USLs** are for customers who want to upgrade the level of their service. 

Each user accessing Microsoft 365 products and services is required to be assigned a USL. Administrators manage licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center. They can assign the licenses to individual user or guest accounts.

#### Types of add-ons

Microsoft 365 business plans have **add-ons** that you can purchase for your subscriptions. Add-ons provide more capabilities to enhance your subscription. There are two types of add-ons:

 -  **Traditional add-ons** are linked to a specific subscription. If you cancel the subscription, the linked add-on is also canceled.
 -  **Standalone add-ons** appear as a separate subscription on the Your products page within the Microsoft 365 admin center. They have their own expiration date and are managed the same way you would any other subscription.
