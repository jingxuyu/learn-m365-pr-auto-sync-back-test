You've learned that you can use Microsoft Defender for Identity to help you to detect for threats across your organization's user identities.  But you want to know more about how you can use it to protect your users' identities, so that you can protect your organization.

Here, you'll learn about some of the key capabilities that you can use in Microsoft Defender for Identity to protect your user identities.

## Monitor and profile user behavior and activities

You can use Microsoft Defender for Identity to analyze user activity and information from domain controllers to build a baseline profile for each user. Through artificial intelligence, you're able to use Microsoft Defender for Identity to detect anomalies and reveal  suspicious activities, compromised users, and insider threats in your organization.

## Protect user identities and reduce the attack surface

Use Microsoft Defender for Identity to proactively protect your environment through security reports and user profile analytics. By following the advice provided by Microsoft Defender for Identity, you can dramatically reduce your organizational attack surface. For example, Microsoft Defender for Identity can identify users or devices using clear-text passwords, allowing you to improve security before an attack takes place.

Lateral movement paths occur when an attacker compromises a non-sensitive user or device to access a sensitive account. For example, all of your admins have security hardened devices and complex passwords, but normal users in your organization have less secure accounts and devices. An attacker could compromise a normal user's device. If an admin ever logs on using that device, the attacker could gain the credentials of the admin. With Microsoft Defender for Identity you can visualize lateral movement paths across your organization, which helps you to proactively prevent these attacks.

## Protect Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) in hybrid environments

Suppose your organization is planning to implement a hybrid environment that consists of Azure-based components and on-premises components such as ADFS. In a hybrid environment, the cloud portion of the infrastructure will have some protections in place by default, but attacks could also occur against on-premises components such as ADFS. You can use Microsoft Defender for Identity to detect attacks on AD FS, to enable you to take appropriate action and ensure that your hybrid environment is protected.
