In addition to PingOne, you can also configure session controls in Cloud App Security using other identity providers, including AD FS.

## What is AD FS?

AD FS enables organizations to provide their users with the flexibility to sign in and authenticate to apps that exist in:

- An on-premises datacenter
- A partner organization
- An online app

By using AD FS, your organization can manage its own user accounts, and users can take advantage of SSO, saving them the need to remember multiple sets of credentials.  

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the following document if you require more guidance on AD FS: [Understanding Key AD FS Concepts]( /windows-server/identity/ad-fs/technical-reference/understanding-key-ad-fs-concepts).

## Overview

Firstly, verify that you have a preconfigured AD FS environment. You'll also need a Microsoft Cloud App Security license. After you verify you meet the prerequisites, you'll need to complete the following steps:

1. Obtain your app's SSO settings
1. Configure Cloud App Security with the app's SSO information
1. Create a new AD FS Relying Party Trust and App Single Sign-On configuration
1. Configure Cloud App Security with the AD FS app's information
1. Complete the configuration of the AD FS Relying Party Trust
1. Get the app changes in Cloud App Security
1. Complete the app changes
1. Complete the configuration in Cloud App Security

Let's look more closely at this procedure using Salesforce as an example app.

### Obtain the app's SSO settings

This process might vary depending on the specific app being configured. But for Salesforce, use this procedure:

1. Select **Setup**, select **Settings**, select **Identity**, and then select **Single Sign-On Settings**.
1. In the **Single Sign-On Settings** section, select the existing AD FS configuration.
1. On the **SAML Single Sign-On Setting** page, make a note of the Salesforce **Login URL**. You'll need this URL later when configuring Cloud App Security.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your app provides a SAML certificate, download it.

### Configure Cloud App Security with the app's SSO settings

The next step is to enter the SSO details from your app into Cloud App Security. Use the following procedure:

1. In Cloud App Security, in the navigation pane, select **Investigate**, then select **Connected apps**.
1. On the **Connected apps** page, select the **Conditional Access App Control apps** tab.
1. To add the details for the new app, select the plus symbol. 
1. In the **Add a SAML application with your identity provider** dialog box, in the search box, enter the app name and then select the app. In this example, enter and select **Salesforce**.
1. Select **Start wizard**.
1. On the **APP INFORMATION** page, select **Fill in data manually**.
1. In the **Assertion consumer service URL**, enter the **Login URL** you recorded earlier and then select **Next**. Pause at this point.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your app provides a SAML certificate, select **Use <app_name> SAML certificate** and upload the certificate file you downloaded earlier.

### Create a new AD FS Relying Party Trust and App Single Sign-On configuration

To limit end-user downtime and preserve your existing known good configuration, it's a good idea to create a new Relying Party Trust and SSO configuration. However, that might not always be possible. For example, if the app you are configuring does not support creating multiple SSO configurations, then skip the following procedure.

> [!NOTE]
> The relying party is the party where the app is located. The relying party functions as the reciprocal of the AD FS authentication process.

1. Open the **AD FS** management console. 
1. In the **Relying Party Trusts** section, review the properties of your existing relying party trust for your app, and record the settings.
1. In **Actions**, select **Add Relying Party Trust**. Apart from the **Identifier** value (which must be a unique name), configure the new trust using the settings you just recorded. You'll need this trust later when configuring Cloud App Security.
1. Open the federation metadata file and record the AD FS **SingleSignOnService Location** value. You'll need this location later.
1. In the **AD FS** console, expand **Service** and then select **Certificates**. Right-click the AD FS signing certificate and select **View Certificate**.

1. In the Certificate dialog box, select the Details tab.
1. Select **Copy to File** to export the certificate as a **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** file.
1. Switch to Salesforce, and on the existing **AD FS single sign-on settings** page, record all settings.
1. Create a new SAML single sign-on configuration. Apart from the **Entity ID** value (which must match the relying party trust Identifier), configure the single sign-on using the settings you recorded earlier. This ID is needed later when you configure Cloud App Security.

### Configure Cloud App Security with the AD FS app's information

Switch back to Cloud App Security. Then, complete the following procedure:

1. In the **Add Salesforce with your identity provider** wizard, on the **IDENTITY PROVIDER** page, select **Next**.
1. On the next page, select **Fill in data manually**.
1. In the **Single sign-on service URL** text box, enter the Salesforce Login URL you recorded earlier.
1. In the **Upload identity provider's SAML certificate** section, select **Browse** and upload the certificate file you downloaded earlier.
1. Select **Next**.
1. On the next page, record the following information for use later, and then select **Next**:

    - Cloud App Security single sign-on URL
    - Cloud App Security attributes and values

### Complete the configuration of the AD FS Relying Party Trust

Switch back to the **AD FS** console. Then complete the following procedure:

1. Right-click the relying party trust, which you created earlier. Select **Edit Claim Issuance Policy**.
1. In the **Edit Claim Issuance Policy** dialog box, in the **Issuance Transform Rules** section, use the information from the following table to complete the steps to create custom rules.

    | Claim rule  name | Custom rule                                                  |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | McasSigningCert  | `=>  issue(type="McasSigningCert", value="<value>");`  where `<value>` is the **McasSigningCert** value from the Cloud App  Security wizard you recorded earlier |
    | McasAppId        | `=>  issue(type="McasAppId", value="<value>");` is the **McasAppId**  value from the Cloud App Security wizard you recorded earlier |

    1. Select **Add Rule**, in the **Claim rule template** section, select **Send Claims Using a Custom Rule**, and then select **Next**.
    1. On the **Configure Rule** page, in addition to any claim rules or attributes required by the app you are configuring, enter the respective **Claim rule name** and **Custom rule** provided.

1. On the **Relying Party Trust** page, right-click on the relying party trust you created earlier, and then select **Properties**.
1. Select the **Endpoints** tab, select **SAML Assertion Consumer Endpoint**, select **Edit**, and replace the **Trusted URL** with the Cloud App Security single sign-on URL you noted earlier, and then select **OK**.
1. If you downloaded a Cloud App Security SAML certificate for the identity provider, then on the **Signature** tab, select **Add** and upload the certificate file, and then select **OK**.
1. Save your settings.

### Get the app changes in Cloud App Security

Switch back to Cloud App Security and in the **Add Salesforce with your identity provider** wizard, on the **APP CHANGES** page, complete the following procedure:

1. Copy the Cloud App Security **SAML Single sign-on URL**.
1. Select the **Cloud App Security SAML certificate** link to download the certificate.
1. Do NOT select **Finish** yet.

### Complete the app changes

Switch back to Salesforce. The complete the following steps:

1. Select **Setup**, select **Settings**, select **Identity**, and then select **Single Sign-On Settings**.
1. It's recommended that you create a backup of your current settings.
1. Then, replace the **Identity Provider Login URL** field value with the **Cloud App Security SAML single sign-on URL** you recorded earlier.
1. Upload the **Cloud App Security SAML** certificate you previously downloaded.
1. Select **Save**.

### Complete the configuration in Cloud App Security

Switch to Cloud App Security. In the **Add Salesforce with your identity provider** wizard, on the **APP CHANGES** page, select **Finish**.

> [!NOTE]
> After completing the wizard, all associated login requests to this app will be routed through Conditional Access App Control.
