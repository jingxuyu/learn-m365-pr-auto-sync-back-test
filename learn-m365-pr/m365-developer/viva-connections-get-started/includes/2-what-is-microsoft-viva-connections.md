Microsoft Viva Connections, which is one of the four Microsoft Viva modules, is the gateway to a modern employee experience. It's personalized and appears in the apps and devices your employees already use every day, such as Microsoft Teams. Viva Connections provides a curated, company-branded experience that brings together relevant news, conversations, and other resources.

Microsoft Viva Connections is available on desktop and mobile devices and offers two distinct experiences optimized for each type of device.

The Viva Connections desktop experience combines the power of your SharePoint intranet with chat and collaboration tools in Microsoft Teams. It enables users to discover and search relevant content, sites, and news from across the organization right from the Team’s app bar. It also allows you to incorporate your organization’s brand and identity directly in Teams.

For mobile devices, Viva Connections allows you to publish a curated dashboard to put the most relevant information at your colleagues’ fingertips. Optionally, you can enable the Feed and Resources tabs to include additional information.

To offer employees a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices, organizations can expose the dashboard in the desktop experience using the Dashboard web part.

You can extend Microsoft Viva Connections with custom components built using modern web technologies. You can connect these components to data and insights from Microsoft 365 and your line-of-business applications.

In the following unit, you will configure Microsoft Viva Connections desktop and mobile in your Microsoft 365 tenant.
