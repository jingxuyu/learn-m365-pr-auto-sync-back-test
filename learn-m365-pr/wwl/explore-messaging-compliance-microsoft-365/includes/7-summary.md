This module examined the different compliance features in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. These features are used by messaging administrators to follow both legal and regulatory requirements.

Messaging administration has taken on high relevance in businesses of all sizes. Because of this fact, compliance has become an essential feature for every messaging administrator to master. Many countries and regions have their own requirements for data protection. Besides these legal requirements, many companies must also meet regulatory requirements in their industry sector. These requirements often limit access to messages for certain business roles or require special retention periods for messages.

In this module, you learned how Microsoft 365 supports the compliance efforts of messaging administrators through features such as:

 -  In-place archiving
 -  Message retention policies
 -  eDiscovery using message tracing

You also learned how to use the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to grant permissions to the users who complete these compliance tasks.
