>![The Start phase](../media/phase-1.png)

You're ready to begin your strategy and project plan. You need to quickly deliver some meaningful results as the overall project budget is not yet set. Realizing that talent is your most important asset first assess the internal resources available to help you accomplish your goals. The following skills and roles are essential to a successful project:

|Role|Description|
|-|-|
|Executive sponsor| Do you have a senior executive in your company that is spearheading the overall business outcomes, including include the implementation of Microsoft Teams?|  
|Success owner|Who is accountable for the overall success of your implementation? Often a business leader (like the head of product development) in partnership with an IT service owner (like the service manager who owns collaboration and communication services).*|
|Project manager|This may be you or another person who has day to day responsibility for managing the project overall including managing risks, issues, and stakeholders.|
|Champions|Do you have an existing network of champions who provide departmental and 1:1 support of employees during their transition?  Do you have a community manager who can provide a consistent presence to these people and handle their training and support?|
|Communications and marketing|Who will help you craft the key messages that will resonate with employees about this change?  What graphic design assistance do you have?|  
|Technical expertise|A deeper understanding of the technical planning, configuration, and deployment of the target software is required.  Technical readiness happens in parallel and simultaneously to user adoption planning.|

> [!NOTE]
> With the advent of Microsoft Teams IT professionals who formerly ran only collaboration or communications/telephony services now need to work together to deliver an integrated experience.  In small organizations this may be one individual but in larger ones it is often two or more people.

> ### Activity 

> Read [Microsoft Teams Phase One](https://aka.ms/O365Champions) for more information on roles and pre-requisites for this phase of your planning. 

> Watch and use introduction videos like "What is Microsoft Teams?" to ensure people begin to understand what this new experience can do.  Note that this video does not focus on a long list of features but on the outcomes for employees.  

## Key role - the executive sponsor

>![Executive sponsor](../media/key-sponsor.png)

What we know is that most employees are not willing to use new technology rolled out by their organization.  When CEO was either fairly or very visible, the transformation project was either very successful or extremely successful.  A well-defined set of financial and operational targets lead to an "extremely successful" transformation*. (* Various third party and Microsoft-based research)

Identify and empower your executive sponsor to be a consistently visible part of your change program. This will support sustained use of the new tools and overall transformation.  Suggest the following methods to have your executives consistently communicate broadly about your program:

1. Use Microsoft Teams Live Events to easily broadcast a digital town hall to employees impacted by the change.  Schedule these regularly - preferably monthly or at a minimum quarterly - to reinforce the overall messages of why your organization is embarking upon a change journey. 
2. Have your Executive Sponsor use the technology themselves. When executives are present in new experiences use of those experiences increases.  Select a relevant executive experience to transform along with other employees.  Work with the executive's support staff directly to ensure a smooth transition. 
3. Use additional forms of communication including email, intranet articles and internal social networks to communicate to employees and also allow executives receive feedback directly.  While a more open and transparent culture may be new to your organization your change program will benefit from this methodology.

If you do not have a senior executive who is willing to participate in this program you may alternatively drive a portion of change in a grassroots manner.  Go directly to a key division or process owner and select them as your experimental transformation process.  Meaningful business results from this experiment may be what is needed to get your C-suite onboard.

## Workstreams and team structures

> ### Activity 
> Now that you've reviewed the video  for workstream assignments and team structures map these out for yourself for your own organization.  This is an opportunity to identify talent within your organization or a gap that may need to be filled from Microsoft or another partner in our ecosystem.  It is important to identify missing talent areas early in your planning process to get the correct kind of help.  Download our Workstream Assignment handout to aid you in this process. 

Free service adoption and deployment planning and execution assistance is available from Microsoft as a part of your Microsoft 365 subscription in a variety of formats via the FastTrack program.  Your company may already be working with a technology partner who can also provide this assistance. 

Here is the list of workstreams or capability areas that require a leader.  The same person can do multiple workstreams depending on their existing workload.  For instance, one individual can manage the Champion, Early Adopter and Feedback workstreams.  If you cannot find a name of a person to put next to the workstream, identify it as a risk and discuss it with your success owner or executive sponsor during your regularly scheduled project meetings.  

- Service strategy and project plan
- Stakeholder mapping and alignments
- Program communications and success stories
- Champion program
- Support readiness
- Early adopters and feedback
- Governance and security
- Technical readiness and alignment
- Metrics and reporting
- Business process mapping
- Awareness campaign
- Training program
- Service health reviews and improvement planning

### Example Activity for Contoso  
For your Contoso project plan you begin to map out the capabilities you will need to successfully deliver a Microsoft Teams implementation.  You are already working with your IT Service Manager who is reviewing SuccessWithTeams.com content to manage the technical readiness.  You meet and discuss timelines and outcomes and jointly review the workstreams shown above.  You both determine that you do not have the bandwidth to handle setting up the Champion and Early Adopter programs or ensure quality and support readiness.  You should undertake one or all of the below actions:

- Because you have an eligible license agreement with over 150 seats your first step is to reach out to the Microsoft FastTrack team via Fasttrack.Microsoft.com  Your IT Administrator can also request help via the Get Help widget in the Office 365 Admin Center.  FastTrack engineers and program managers will reach out to help you resolve your technical questions and create a success plan for Microsoft Teams. 
- To learn from other people who are also driving adoption of Microsoft Teams you can visit and ask questions in the Driving Adoption forum on the Microsoft Technical Community at https://aka.ms/DriveAdoption.
- If you have a technology partner that is already helping you in your company you should speak with them about their Microsoft Teams experience to determine if they are qualified to assist you.  Through FastTrack, community forums and your other business relationships you can find additional Microsoft Certified Partners to assist you in this work.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If you do not have an active relationship with your IT Service Manager reach out to him/her and start a conversation about partnering on this project.  Be open to their feedback and emphasize that you are focused on the end-user adoption portion of the roll out to ensure employee satisfaction with the service they are trying hard to deliver.   Having this conversation over lunch never hurt building this important relationship. 

## Understanding the change curve

>![The change curve](../media/change-curve.png)

In any change program it is important to understand the basic change curve that applies to all people going through change.  Whether personal or professional this structure applies.  In our example we will use professional examples but think about how change has happened in your life and how you have responded to it.   This will help you have empathy and compassion for those who are more resistant to change than may make you comfortable.

**Denial** - Many people consciously or sub-consciously are in denial that change needs to occur.  They are comfortable doing things the way they have been.  Consider that in your awareness campaigns and executive communications that you must inform people of why this change will benefit them and the company.  It is often effective to tailor messages to the audience you are talking to.  Do not shy away from discussing the most basic of motivations with your employees in positive terms. 

**Resistance** - People will hear your message the first time but often will continue to actively or passively resist change.  Utilize outreach strategies to engage with resistance such as breakfast or lunch meetings with food, rewarding early adopters with recognition or showing how useful meaningful change can be with early adopter case studies.  Encourage direct feedback at these events to mine for conflict and program challenges.  Start the conversation by pointing out difficulties you had with making the change while facilitating the conversation toward positive suggestions and away from a complaint session.  

**Exploration** - When you have influenced your target audience enough they will begin to explore the new behavior. This is a delicate time and the use of Champions are key to creating a favorable experience of the new behavior.  Barriers to entry, friction in the experience or unreliability of the tools or assistance can pop your employees right back into the resistance phase.  It is also worth mentioning that while younger workers may explore a new technology experience more quickly, older workers between the ages of 55 and 74 have the highest opinion of teamwork according to a [Gartner study](https://solutionstrategist.com/home/agile-service-management/).  They are the 2nd most likely demographic to try the new experience you are designing.  

**Commitment** - Your employee has now had a positive experience and been rewarded for it.  Now they are committed to continuing with the new behavior but only if it continues to serve their needs.  Each day the employee participates in the new behavior you can reinforce the change or have people revert from a poorly operating experience.  Traditional IT goals like resilience, up-time, performance and security are essential to delivering on this promise of your overall business goals. 

### Activity for Contoso  
You need to get more data about your organization to craft your end-user adoption plan. It is especially important that you understand the needs of your remote sales workers and people in offices in other regions where you are not sitting.  You will use Office 365 Forms or another survey tool to send out questions ahead of launching your early adopter pilot.  This information will help you to prioritize the different issues each user persona may have.  Download our Sample User Survey spreadsheet to get ideas for questions but make sure you transfer these questions into Office 365 for easy distribution and analysis.  

>[!NOTE]  
> Make sure you ask your employees if you can contact them for further information.  For those who opt in select several in key demographics (region, role, user profile) to interview in person or via video chat.  Those vocal contributors may be candidates for your early adopter or champion programs.  In user interviews try to ask open ended questions to not form the employee's opinion for them.  An example may be, "Can you tell me more about your collaboration experience?"
