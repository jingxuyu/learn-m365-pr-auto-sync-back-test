As part of their planning effort, the Global and Search admins from our scenario are ready to begin determining how they'll measure the success of Microsoft Search.

## Microsoft Search usage metrics

Use the Microsoft Search metrics to help define how you'll measure success of the search experience across your organization. After Microsoft Search has rolled out, you can use these same data points to make informed decisions about content you need to add or retire.

To review usage metrics, go to the [**Insights section**](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MicrosoftSearch/insights) of the **Search & intelligence** settings in the [**Microsoft 365 admin center**](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home). If your organization hasn't widely adopted Microsoft Search yet, your insights dashboard will have little or no data to report. The image below shows an example of how usage metrics appear after people in your organization begin using Microsoft Search.

Search data is available for:

- Office.com
- Microsoft Search in Bing work tab (page URLs that begin with bing.com/work)
- SharePoint Home (the site with URL ending in /SharePoint.aspx)

Search insights include reports and data for:

   | Report                            | Description |
   | --------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | **Query volume**                  | The total number of search queries performed. Use to determine periods of high and low search activity. Low volume may indicate a lack of user awareness of Microsoft Search or search entry points. |
   | **Top queries**                   | The most popular search queries in your organization. Use to understand the types of information your users are searching for. |
   | **No results queries**            | Popular search queries that returned no results and might create user dissatisfaction. Use to identify potential content gaps or improve discoverability of existing content. |
   | **Abandoned queries**             | The most popular search queries with low click-through. Use to identify potential content gaps or adjust keywords and settings of existing content. |

## Quantitative measurements

Understanding how products like Office apps, SharePoint, and Microsoft Edge are used within your organization may help you set benchmarks for how frequently you expect people to use Microsoft Search. For more information on:

- SharePoint search usage, see [Search usage reports in modern sites](/sharepoint/view-search-usage-reports).
- Microsoft 365 apps usage, see [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/microsoft365-apps-usage).
- Microsoft Edge usage, see [Microsoft browser usage report](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-browser-usage-report).

If your organization has a help desk or support team, consider getting data about common troubleshooting issues that search could help solve. It will help you determine a baseline so you can see how search is reducing support issues over time.

## Qualitative measurements

User surveys and focus groups can help you understand what people in your organization like and dislike about your current internal search solution. They can also help you prioritize the content they would expect or like to find when using Microsoft Search.

Once you determine the methods and metrics you'll use to measure the success of Microsoft Search, it's important to consistently apply them to see progress over time. Review your success metrics with your stakeholders to ensure everyone understands what you are measuring and why. As you continue to use and improve Microsoft Search, you may need to refine or add other measurements.
