In our introductory scenario, you, as the chief of staff, wanted to measure how the shift to working remotely has affected employee collaboration and well-being.

The Business continuity dashboard gives you an insight into how collaboration has changed, including changes to activity levels in email, meetings and Teams chats and calls, with the shift to remote work. You can see that different employee subgroups  are being impacted by shifts in the amount of total collaboration, increases in time spent outside of the normal workday, and changes in communication levels with others outside your organization.

It would be much more difficult to build a similar report from scratch without Workplace Analytics data. If you or your Business Analyst has approval to access raw Microsoft 365 data, you would have to figure out how to gather the raw signal data for all users, make sense of the data, calculate business metrics, and maintain employee privacy and data security. And only then could you build your business continuity report.

The report pages and metrics in the Workplace Analytics Business continuity dashboard let you see how the organization has adapted to remote work and to identify specific areas that are experiencing notable changes in work patterns. 

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Explain what the Workplace Analytics Power BI Business continuity dashboard is, and why it provides an important perspective.
- Run queries, load the data, and select your settings.
- Interpret the results in the dashboard.
