Holly selected Allan's mail folder and then navigated to the Folder tab. In the Properties group, Holly noticed the Policy command was missing on the ribbon. Which of the following items describes why the Policy command didn't appear on the ribbon?"
    choices:
    - content: "An administrator didn't enable retention policies for Contoso's Microsoft 365 tenant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't a reason why the Policy command didn't appear on the ribbon. Try again."
    - content: "Contoso's default policy tag had been deleted"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't a reason why the Policy command didn't appear on the ribbon. Try again."
    - content: "An administrator didn't enable retention policies for Allan's account"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If the Policy command is missing on the ribbon, either an administrator hasn't enabled retention policies for the user's account, or the user isn't using an Outlook license required for the feature."
