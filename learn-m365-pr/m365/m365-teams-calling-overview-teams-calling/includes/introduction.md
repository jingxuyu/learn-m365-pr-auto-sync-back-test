Microsoft Teams is often perceived to be an internal messaging and communications platform, enabling users inside an organization to converse securely. However, Microsoft has now integrated it with their Phone System solution to provide traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX) capabilities through your existing Teams application framework. This integration enables users to make outbound calls and receive incoming calls to and from external sources. 
Phone System can work with your existing PBX or can be used instead of a PBX to allow your users to make inbound and outbound calls.

Here, you’ll learn about the architecture needed to support Teams Calling, gain an awareness of Phone System’s capabilities, learn about Direct Routing, and Microsoft calling plans.  

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the Teams Calling Architecture.
- Have a clear understanding of the capabilities of Phone System.
- Understand the benefits of Direct Routing.
- Understand the different Teams Calling Plans available to your organization.
