What's the next step that Holly should perform?"

      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Search the content locations associated with the case"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This is the second step in the eDiscovery (Standard) workflow. After an organization creates eDiscovery holds, it can use the built-in search tool to search the content locations on hold."
    - content: "Place a hold on the content locations associated with Allan Deyoung"
      isCorrect: true

In the eDiscovery (Standard) workflow, the first step after creating a case is placing a hold (also called an eDiscovery hold) on the content locations of the people of interest in the investigation. Content locations include Exchange mailboxes, SharePoint sites, OneDrive accounts, and the mailboxes and sites associated with Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups."
