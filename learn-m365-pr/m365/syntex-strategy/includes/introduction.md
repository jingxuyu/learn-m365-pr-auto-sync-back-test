SharePoint Syntex uses the power of AI to turn complex and scattered information into understandable and actionable knowledge. Establishing a clear and thoughtful strategy for using SharePoint Syntex can determine how effective the solution is for your organization.

Suppose you work for Contoso Electronics, a large electronic components company. You’ve noticed a considerable volume of documents and forms are constantly being saved and shared between multiple document libraries. Team members in your organization are accessing these documents, from directors and managers to sales staff and technicians. While these teams are spending a growing number of hours searching and browsing this content to find what they need, the impact has been _particularly_ noticeable for sales, who are spending more time searching through these libraries looking for sales contracts, purchase orders, and other important documents, instead of spending much-needed time directly in front of clients. Wouldn’t a more organized, thoughtful content system help give back essential time to the staff?

In this module, you will learn about useful scenarios for utilizing SharePoint Syntex; how to identify the proper roles and responsibilities within your organization for supporting SharePoint Syntex; which key stakeholders should be involved in SharePoint Syntex adoption; and how your team can align on a strategy for SharePoint Syntex. Once completed with this module, you will be able to organize your team for an effective SharePoint Syntex rollout, and develop an actionable SharePoint Syntex strategy.
