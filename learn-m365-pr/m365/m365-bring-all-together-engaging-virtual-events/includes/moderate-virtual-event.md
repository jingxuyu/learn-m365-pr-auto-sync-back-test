Next â€“ the moderator. For many events, a moderator is the difference that makes an event successful. They help ensure a smooth session by managing the virtual logistics and audience, leaving the presenter to focus on content. Presenters shouldn't have to think about anything other than showing up, having good audio and video quality, and delivering their content. Moderators improve attendee engagement, minimize load on the technical support staff, and provide event polish with pre-designed introductions and closing messages in larger scale events.

Part of your role on the virtual summit event team is to create and train a team of moderators to support the presenters and technical staff, and to help attendees have a smooth event experience. Let's look at best practices that help your moderator ensure an engaging and successful virtual event.

- Resolving basic technical issues.
