### Learn how Lamna Healthcare announce Viva Connections to its employees

You invite corporate sponsors, early adopters, and testers to serve at
the Lamna Healthcare Viva Connections adoption committee as the team of
champions. You know that they can serve as the Viva Connections
champions, because they understand the value of new technology and are
excited to help others adopt this new tool.

Champions can help identify the best communication strategies and
platforms to reach each employee group. As the Internal Communications
Manager, you work with the adoption committee to discuss how each
employee group usually learns about news and announcements. For example,
nurses and surgeons get the most important news in SharePoint news posts
and in Outlook. Hybrid workers, like IT professionals and the
administration team, are used to getting information from Teams channels
and Yammer communities. Other roles like the custodial staff and café
operators get the most important announcements in team meetings or in
the form of a poster in the breakroom. The adoption committee has
decided that they will announce the launch of Viva Connections through
multiple channels to make sure every group has an opportunity to improve
their workflow using this new tool.

A few weeks before the launch, the Viva Connections adoption committee
and the communications team begin a two-round email campaign that
reaches every employee at Lamna Healthcare. You also work with the
adoption committee to schedule office hours (flexible drop-in hours) to
provide extra support over the next 90 days. The adoption committee puts
together change management guidance for managers and end-user training
for Viva Connections that is accessible in Teams and SharePoint. Let’s
see how Kayla, a HR generalist, and Maya, a nurse hear about the launch
of Viva Connections from different channels:

Kayla,
an HR generalist who completes most of her work on a computer, first
learns about the launch of Viva Connections the Office of Human
Resources Teams channel. She then joins the discussion about Viva
Connections launch in the hospital’s Yammer community. Lastly, she
receives the organization wide email announcement about the launch.

Maya
and her nurse colleagues, however, are introduced to Viva Connections in
a SharePoint news post. They also see Lamna’s version of Viva
Connections announced on breakroom posters, “*LamnaNet is Coming!*”
Lastly, Maya and her colleagues receive the email announcement a few
weeks before the launch. They are excited to use this new technology to
manage their shifts and tasks more efficiently. They later attend a
training event for hourly employees offered during both day and at night
shirts.
