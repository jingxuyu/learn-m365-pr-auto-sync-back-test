To get their work done, people in an organization collaborate with others both inside and outside the organization. By doing so, content no longer stays behind a firewall. It can roam everywhere, across devices, apps, and services. And when it roams, it should do so in a secure, protected way that meets its organization's business and compliance policies.

Sensitivity labels from the Microsoft Purview Information Protection solution let you classify and protect your organization's data, while making sure that user productivity and their ability to collaborate isn't hindered.

All Microsoft Purview Information Protection solutions are implemented by using sensitivity labels. In this module, you'll learn how create and configure the sensitivity labels that you want to make available for apps and other services. For example, the labels you want users to see and apply from Office apps.

You'll then examine how to create one or more label policies that contain the labels and policy settings that you configure. It's the label policy that publishes the labels and settings for your chosen users and locations.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how sensitivity labels let you classify and protect your organization's data.
 -  Identify the common reasons why organizations use sensitivity labels.
 -  Explain what a sensitivity label is and what they can do for an organization.
 -  Configure a sensitivity label's scope.
 -  Explain why the order of sensitivity labels in your admin center is important.
 -  Describe what label policies can do.
