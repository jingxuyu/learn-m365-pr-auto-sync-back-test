This module examined the range of tools and features in the Microsoft 365 compliance center that help organizations ensure their Microsoft Teams usage follows government and industry regulations and standards.

Organizations of all industry types all over the world must follow different legal and regulatory business requirements. For example, some countries require companies to store their business data for a certain amount of time and protect tax relevant data against accidental or intended deletion. Other regulatory requirements need companies of certain industries to store medical and health data for a certain time.

The module began by exploring how sensitivity labels from the Microsoft Information Protection framework let you classify and protect your organization's data, while making sure that user productivity and their ability to collaborate isn't hindered. Sensitivity labels allow Teams admins to regulate access to sensitive organizational content created during collaboration within teams.

You then learned how to create retention policies. Retention policies and retention labels from Microsoft 365 help you to more effectively manage the information in your organization. Teams supports retention policies for chat and channel messages so that as an admin, you can decide proactively whether to keep this data, delete it, or keep it for a specific period of time and then delete it.

The module then examined communication compliance, which is an insider risk solution in Microsoft 365. The pre-defined and custom policies allow you to scan internal and external communications for policy matches so they can be examined by chosen reviewers. Reviewers can investigate inappropriate content and take appropriate actions to make sure they're compliant with your organization's message standards.

You then learned how to generate Data Loss Prevention policies to protect against data leakage and how to deploy communication compliance for reviewing communication. The module then showed you how to activate the scoped directory search in Teams and how to create information barriers to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other.

Finally, you learned how to create and manage eDiscovery cases and supervision policies, compliance recording policies, and alert policies for events in Microsoft Teams.
