  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to assign multiple end-user roles to Susie, who's an end user in the Sales department. What's the easiest way for Holly to assign multiple end-user roles to Susie?"
    choices:
    - content: "Assign a role group that includes multiple roles"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Role groups are only used with administrative roles and not end-user roles. Try again."
    - content: "Through a role assignment policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Role assignment policies aren't used for assigning roles to users. Try again."
    - content: "By assigning each individual end-user role to Susie"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Holly can't assign a role group to Susie, because role groups are only used with administrative roles and not end-user roles. Holly must assign each individual end-user role to Susie."
