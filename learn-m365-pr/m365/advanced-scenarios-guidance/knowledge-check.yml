  questions: 
  - content: "You’ve blocked access to a suspect website for your entire organization. However, a user finds that they can still access the site by using their iPhone. How can you prevent this access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use Intune to deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS to all iPhones in your organization."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for iOS enables you to protect Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps measures onto iOS devices."
    - content: "Create a custom indicator of compromise that blocks the website."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. If the iOS device can still access the blocked website, a custom indicator of compromise will not fix the problem."
    - content: "Install a new log collector to protect iOS devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. A log collector doesn’t protect devices. Instead it helps Shadow IT discovery by collecting logs from "
  - content: "Your organization has recently acquired a new company and you want to investigate Shadow IT that is in use on the company’s network. You have installed a log collector but it cannot connect to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Which of the following conditions might cause this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "You have used a Linux container for the log collector. Use a Windows container instead"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. You can use a container on either a Linux docker host or a Windows docker host to run the log collector."
    - content: "The Defender for Cloud Apps portal doesn’t trust the root certificate authority installed on the log collector"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. The Defender for Cloud Apps portal doesn’t need to trust the root certificate installed on the log collector to transfer logs."
    - content: "The log collector doesn’t trust the root certificate authority installed on the proxy server"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. If the log collector doesn’t trust the root certificate installed on the proxy server, then it can’t establish a secure connection through that proxy server to the Defender for Cloud Apps portal and transfer logs."
  - content: "A new phishing attack relies on users being misled into downloading a compiled executable file and running it. How can you ensure that Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps blocks this new file as quickly as possible?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use a new file policy to implement a custom indicator of compromise."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. In the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal, you can create policies to match new indicators of compromise quickly and use them to delete or quarantine files."
    - content: "Write a custom app that uses the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps REST API to define a custom indicator of compromise."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. It would take time to develop and test custom code that calls the REST API. You need a quicker method to respond to this threat before the file enters your systems."
    - content: "Configure all log collectors to block the executable file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Log collectors are used to obtain logs from firewalls and proxy servers and send them to Defender for Cloud Apps. You can’t use them to intercept and prevent access to malicious files."
  - content: "You’re using the Advanced hunting tool in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to find information about a suspicious activity certain users have been executing. Which of these languages should you use to write the query?"
    choices:
    - content: "Transact SQL"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal doesn’t support the Transact-SQL language for queries in the advanced hunting tool."
    - content: "Kusto"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal uses the Kusto query language for queries in the advanced hunting tool."
    - content: "XML"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal doesn’t support the Transact-SQL language for queries in the advanced hunting tool."
  - content: "You have used curl to issue the following REST request but have been denied access. What should you do to fix the problem? `curl -XGET 'https://<portal_url>/api/v1/alerts'`"
    choices:
    - content: "Include a filter in your query"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. A filter is used to return more relevant results. You’ve been denied access because you haven’t authenticated with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps REST API."
    - content: "Include an authorization token in your command"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That’s correct. You’ve been denied access because you haven’t authenticated with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps REST API. To authenticate, include an authorization token."
    - content: "Send the query from custom code instead of from the curl command-line tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That’s incorrect. You can send requests with either curl or custom code. You’ve been denied access because you haven’t authenticated with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps REST API."
