Customer Lockbox supports requests to access data in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business when Microsoft engineers need to access customer content to determine root cause and fix an issue. Customer Lockbox requires the engineer to request access from the customer as a final step in the approval workflow. This gives organizations the option to approve or deny these requests and provide direct-access control to the customer.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the Customer Lockbox workflow.
- Explain how to approve or deny a Customer Lockbox request.
- Explain how you can audit actions performed by Microsoft engineers when access requests are approved.
