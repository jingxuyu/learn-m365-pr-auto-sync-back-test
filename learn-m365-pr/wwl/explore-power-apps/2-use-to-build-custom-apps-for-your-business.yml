  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As Contoso's Enterprise Administrator, you're interested in implementing Power Apps. However, you want your users to create apps where the app layout and the views and detail screens are determined by the components and based on the data structure. Which Power App type should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Canvas apps"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In canvas apps, the app layout and the views and detail screens are not determined by the components and they're not based on the data structure. Try again."
    - content: "Model-driven apps"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Model-driven apps require a Common Data Service database and are built on top of the data modeled in that database environment. The app creator can determine the components (forms, charts, views, dashboards, and so on) to include in the app. However, the app layout and the views and detail screens are determined by the components and based on the data structure."
    - content: "Portals"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In portal apps, the app layout and the views and detail screens are not determined by the components and they're not based on the data structure. Try again."
