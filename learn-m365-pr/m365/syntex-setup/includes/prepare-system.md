Before you begin setting up SharePoint Syntex, consider Contoso Electronics' content libraries. Are you initiating a controlled rollout of the service, applying it to only a few libraries in the company or in a business unit before offering the service company-wide?

During setup of SharePoint Syntex, you will be asked to name your default content center. It helps to have that name already in mind. Will it be a company-wide content center? Or does it make more strategic sense for your company to create several content centers that align with lines of business? Your naming convention decisions may depend on those choices.

To successfully set up SharePoint Syntex, you must have Global admin or SharePoint admin permissions. These permissions are required to access the Microsoft 365 admin center. Set up for Syntex is initiated in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Be aware that you can alter settings after your initial setup of SharePoint Syntex, if necessary. Those changes will be made in the Microsoft 365 admin center.  

Your organization, Contoso Electronics, has decided on a staged roll-out for SharePoint Syntex. Your project team selected the Human Resources department's content library as the first target. The primary goal is to define and apply your company's data retention and privacy policies in a controlled, methodical rollout that will bring the Human Resources documents and forms into compliance in an organized and easy-to-understand fashion. To maintain confidentiality, the Human Resources department and your project team decided to create a content center that will house the Document Understanding models dedicated to Human Resources. The models will be applied to libraries in Human Resources' main content site. The name of the content center will be Contoso Electronics Content Center. You will partner with the Human Resources management team to set up SharePoint Syntex on the Human Resources SharePoint library.

Note that a limited preview content center is available for evaluation through the SharePoint admin center site creation menu.

The first step is to assess licensing requirements. Your organization must have a subscription to SharePoint Syntex. Each user needs a SharePoint Syntex license. Read more about licensing requirements [here]().

- If, at any time, your organization cancels the SharePoint Syntex subscription, no content will be deleted from existing libraries. However, access to creating or running document understanding or form processing models will be lost.  

In the second step, you must purchase AI Builder credits. If you deploy 300 or more SharePoint Syntex subscriptions, 1 million AI Builder credits will be included. Because of the slower, staged roll out, Contoso Electronics will require that you and the Human Resources management team take the time to estimate how many documents you want to process per month using the [AI Builder calculator]() where you can also purchase the credits you need to begin processing documents and forms.

If you have more than one Power Platform environment configured, you can pick which one you want to use for form processing. This option does not appear if you have a single environment configured.

In this scenario, pick the platform you want to use for setting up your initial SharePoint Syntex environment.
