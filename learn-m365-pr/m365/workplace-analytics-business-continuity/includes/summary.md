In the introductory scenario, you, as the chief of staff, want to measure how the shift to remote work has affected employee collaboration and wellbeing.

The Business continuity dashboard gives you insight into how collaboration has changed with a shift in work, including changes to activity levels in email, meetings, and Teams chats and calls. You can see that different employee subgroups  are being impacted by shifts in the amount of total collaboration, increases in time spent outside of the normal workday, and changes in communication levels with others outside your organization.

It would be difficult to build a similar report from scratch without Workplace Analytics data. If you or your business analyst has approval to access raw Microsoft 365 data, you could figure out how to gather the raw signal data for all your employees, organize and analyze the data, and calculate the applicalbe business metrics, all while maintaining employee privacy and data security. Only then could you build a business continuity report.

The report pages and metrics in the Business continuity dashboard show you how the organization has adapted to remote work and identifies those who are experiencing notable changes in work patterns.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:
  
* Explain what the Business continuity dashboard in Power BI is, and why it provides an important perspective.
* Use the Query designer to use templates, run queries, load query data, and select your settings.
* Interpret the results in the dashboard.
