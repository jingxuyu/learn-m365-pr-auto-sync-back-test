# Summary 

Today’s sophisticated attacks on corporate resources require protection that can automatically recognize anomalous conditions and remediate security risks. Conditional access helps ensure that users can securely access the resources they need to stay productive.

Question 1   

Why do today’s security analysts sometimes describe identity security as “the new control plane?”  

Unlike the days of single organizational identities, workers today use many devices and cloud apps with multiple identities and passwords. 
Explanation: As users now access data through multiple devices and identities, the network perimeter is no longer the first line of defense. 

In the time of mainframes and local identities, IT was not concerned about identity management, but with the advent of cloud computing it’s become significant. 
Explanation: IT has always been concerned with identity security. Cloud computing and proliferation of mobile devices have made identity and access control critical.  

Before cloud computing, all user credentials resided on-premises; now they all live in a public cloud.  
Explanation: Not all organizations store user credentials in a public cloud. Regardless of where credentials reside, passwords are not the most reliable protection against network breaches. 

Question 2 

Why is user identity vulnerable to attacks in today’s digital landscape?  

Sophisticated attackers can exploit software vulnerabilities by inserting malicious code in webpages and thereby gain access to credentials stored on users’ devices. 
Explanation: Users don’t always store credentials on their devices, but smart hackers use social engineering techniques to trick users into divulging credentials. 

Most organizations now store workforce credentials in the cloud where they are increasingly vulnerable to attack. 
Explanation: Regardless of where credentials are stored, attackers target weak or duplicate passwords that are the most vulnerable to compromise. 

Because users access organization data through mobile devices and cloud apps, they must remember numerous passwords, and hackers can exploit this weakness.  
Explanation: Because users find it difficult to remember numerous personal and work passwords, they tend to use weak or duplicate passwords that are vulnerable to identity theft and brute force attacks. 

 

Question 3 

Which of these describes a modern identity and access management strategy?  

Prioritize hardening the on-premises network security perimeter while requiring periodic password changes. 
Explanation: Requiring regular password changes is best practice but it doesn’t fully address phishing attacks and the user experience. 

Protect internal and external user identity while improving user experience and productivity. 
Explanation: Users value productivity over identity protection and prefer a simple authentication experience. 

Create and enforce a single strong access policy for all users. 
Explanation: A modern access management strategy avoids a one-size-fits-all approach, preferring to customize policy based on user role and need to access.
