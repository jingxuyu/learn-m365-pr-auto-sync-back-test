To protect endpoints, it's critical to understand exactly what they are. Here, we'll define what an endpoint is according to Zero Trust, and then introduce the concept of an attack surface based on that definition.

## What is an endpoint?

An *endpoint* is any entity that connects to, and communicates through, a network. This includes devices such as computers, mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, USB devices, and more.

Endpoints can be owned by an organization or a user. They can be fully managed by an organization's IT team (think work laptops) or partially managed. For example, an individual owns the device, but uses an email client (managed by their organization's IT department) for emails.

In short, endpoints vary widely in type, ownership, and management.

## What is an attack surface?

Cybercriminals will try to use _any_ endpoint to carry out attacks. This means that _all_ endpoints can potentially be compromised for malicious purposes since they are *attack vectors*. *Attack surface* refers to the collection of these threat vectors. Let's look at how the use of endpoints can result in a pervasive and encompassing attack surface:

As we can see, the typical employee at an organization might use several devices to carry out their daily work, from home, all the way to their office. This creates a large attack surface, which presents many opportunities for cybercriminals to take advantage. As endpoints become more integral to our lives, attack surfaces will continue to get larger and more pervasive. Accordingly, the need to protect all endpoints becomes more critical.
