  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Tailspin Toys runs Exchange Server 2019. As the company's Messaging administrator, Alan Deyoung increased the maximum Sent message size for the organization from 10 MB to 20 MB. However, Alan later learned that some users' messages were being blocked because they were too large. The blocked messages were all around 15 MB in size. Why were they blocked?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alan didn't update the Shadow redundancy setting"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Shadow redundancy settings have nothing to do with blocked messages related to message size. Try again."
    - content: "Alan didn't change the maximum message size on Tailspin Toys' Send connector to 20 MB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Even if you configure organization level settings, you may still need to configure individual services or Exchange objects. For example, if you change the maximum message size for your organization, you must also change the maximum message sizes on your receive and send connectors. Failure to do so will still block your users' messages if theyâ€™re too large."
    - content: "Alan didn't adjust the message throttling setting on the Send connector"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The message throttling setting has nothing to do with blocked messages related to message size. Try again."
