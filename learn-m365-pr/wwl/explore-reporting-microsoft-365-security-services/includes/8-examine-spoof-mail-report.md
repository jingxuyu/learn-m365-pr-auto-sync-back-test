Organizations can intentionally use spoofing for good reason, but some types of spoofing are malicious. This report includes both types of spoofing emails received by your organization.

For example, you may contract a third party to send an invite to all employees for a company event. This type of email would appear in this report as **non-spam** or **Good mail**. Microsoft 365 also detects malicious mail sent to your company and labels it **Caught as spam**.

The Spoof Mail report shows how many spoof mail messages were detected. Of that number, it also displays the messages that were considered good or done for legitimate business reasons.

To view this report, go to the Security &amp; Compliance Center and select **Reports &gt; Dashboard &gt; Spoof Mail.**

When you hover over a day in the chart, you can see how many spoof mail messages came through. The counts are aggregated based on whether the spoof message was marked as spam (Caught as spam) or non-spam (Good mail).

Based on results in this report, an organization can then decide if it should use the Spoof Intelligence feature in the anti-spam settings to choose whether to allow or block a sender from spoofing users.
