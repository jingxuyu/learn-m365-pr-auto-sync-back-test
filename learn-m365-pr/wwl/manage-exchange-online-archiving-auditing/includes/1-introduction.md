Because of the complex retention requirements of modern messaging environments, itâ€™s essential to understand how archiving is accomplished in Microsoft Exchange. This understanding enables messaging administrators to provide an efficient and compliant environment to their users.

To support this effort, this module begins by examining in-place archiving and auditing in Exchange Online. Implementing and managing in-place archiving is a process that requires considerable planning. As such, it's important that you understand how archive storage is provided to your users and how messages are automatically processed and archived.

The module then examines journaling in Exchange. Journaling can help an organization respond to legal, regulatory, and organizational compliance requirements by recording all or targeted email messages.

The module concludes with an exploration of audit logging, which is another key aspect of messaging compliance. Audit logging in Exchange provides information about administrator, delegate, and user actions in user mailboxes and your Exchange organization.
