    choices:
    - content: "To purchase the right ransomware for the target system."

    - content: "To purchase access credentials for the target system."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Initial Access Brokers look for ways into your systems, and then sell them to the highest bidder."

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Initial Access Broker's role isn't to facilitate joining a ransomware syndicate."
