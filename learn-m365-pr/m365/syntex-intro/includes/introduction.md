You can only do so much with the time you have in a day – with thousands of documents circulating throughout your organization in just a week, how do you make real sense of the information efficiently and profitably? SharePoint Syntex is a content understanding, processing, and compliance service that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to automatically and thoughtfully organize and classify documents in your SharePoint library – transforming your data into knowledge.

AI and machine learning help you better understand your content by accurately and efficiently classifying and extracting relevant information. Rather than clicking and sorting through hundreds, or even thousands of files, SharePoint Syntex extracts data for you, streamlining the search and discovery process. This returns valuable time to you and your team. You can not only dive deeper into your content to truly understand it, now you can also increase document insight and control.

Imagine you work for Contoso Electronics. The company handles a high volume of documents and forms transferred between you, your clients, and all the departments in your business – from Human Resources to Accounting to Sales. Documents and forms typically include contracts, billing statements, forms, inquiries, applications, and more. Most of these documents are already stored in SharePoint document libraries, but the number of filed documents is growing. It's becoming increasingly difficult to locate the information you need. A quarterly Accounting review deadline is looming, and financial data needs to be organized and extracted from these documents. It's a time-consuming challenge.

In this module, you'll learn what SharePoint Syntex is and how it can help resolve this challenge. You'll learn how SharePoint Syntex works, when to use it, _and when not to_. As you work through this example, you'll see how SharePoint Syntex can save hundreds of hours of labor and not only help meet quarterly goals, but also create a solid foundation for content understanding.
