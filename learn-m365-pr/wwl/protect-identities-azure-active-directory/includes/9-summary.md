Windows Hello enables organizations to implement two-factor authentication, while providing an easier authentication experience for users on devices that support biometric sign-in. Windows Hello can be implemented in cloud, on-premises and hybrid environments. Azure AD Identity Protection actively monitors authentications, evaluates the circumstances, and calculates potential risk, such as consecutive logins from different locations. Azure AD also provides the ability for users to reset their own password, while giving Administrators the ability to configure the criteria required to complete the task. With Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, organizations can configure users provide two or more credentials (such as a PIN and a mobile phone) to sign in to devices and access resources.
