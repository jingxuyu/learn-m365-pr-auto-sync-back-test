In this module, we examined how to successfully plan your hybrid needs and begin the integration process between your on-premises deployments and Microsoft 365. The module introduced you to creating hybrid environments for Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business. We learned that creating a hybrid environment involves connecting your existing on-premises services, such as Exchange and Active Directory, with corresponding services that exist in the cloud. Each on-premises service and its corresponding cloud service creates a trust connection and allows information to flow freely between both environments.

You learned in this module that planning a hybrid Exchange environment centers around the hybrid deployment prerequisites, since the Hybrid Configuration wizard performs the actual configuration process. Before you create and configure a hybrid deployment using the Hybrid Configuration wizard, your existing on-premises Exchange organization must meet certain requirements. If you don't meet these requirements, you can't complete the steps within the Hybrid Configuration wizard, nor can you configure a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Exchange organization and Exchange Online.

You learned in this module that planning a SharePoint hybrid environment is about using both SharePoint Server on-premises and Microsoft 365 SharePoint Online to achieve your business goals. To create a hybrid SharePoint environment, there are many planning guidelines that must be considered when choosing the best solution for your company. Most of these functions can be addressed by using the SharePoint Online Hybrid Picker, which can be downloaded from the SharePoint Online admin center.

You learned in this module that planning a hybrid Microsoft Teams and Skype for Business environment will enable your on-premises Skype for Business users who are simultaneously using Microsoft Teams to inter-operate with Skype for Business users from their Teams client. It will also enable the Skype for Business users to communicate with users in federated organizations from their Teams client. Configuring a hybrid Skype for Business deployment and upgrading to Teams Only mode in the Microsoft Teams admin center will enable this functionality.
