## Set up Workplace Analytics

Setting up Workplace Analytics is a straightforward process. Here's an overview of the primary steps:

1. Your Microsoft 365 or Azure Active Directory administrator assigns the licenses and roles.
1. The designated Workplace Analytics administrator enters system defaults and privacy settings.
1. The Workplace Analytics administrator prepares and uploads the organizational data.
1. Workplace Analytics validates the upload and then processes the data.

After these steps are complete, your organization has full access to all service features (except Upload and administrative settings).

Organizational data contains effective dates that map to the Microsoft 365 data. This data should be uploaded on a regular monthly schedule to reflect changes in your organization. The Microsoft 365 collaboration data updates weekly.

## Workplace Analytics and data privacy

As a Microsoft 365 service, Workplace Analytics sits in your organization's trust boundaries with privacy safeguards and protections for individuals. By default, only metadata is processed for metric generation and personal information is not included. Your organization has full control over how Workplace Analytics is used, deployed, and the visibility it has in your organization.

These are the customer-specific controls.

- Scope of population (with the option to exclude sensitive groups).
- Analyst access to Workplace Analytics and access to specific population scopes.
- Visibility to meeting subject lines.
- Rule out all meetings and emails by keywords (in subject lines) that you deem sensitive.
- Specific individuals or domains.
- Organizational attributes loaded.

With Workplace Analytics, the objective is not to examine individual activity, but to recognize group level trends happening in your organization. It looks at header level metadataâ€”no content, such as body of emails, email attachments, or anything considered sensitive in nature.

Features in Workplace Analytics default to non-personal information and a minimum aggregate threshold of five employees.
