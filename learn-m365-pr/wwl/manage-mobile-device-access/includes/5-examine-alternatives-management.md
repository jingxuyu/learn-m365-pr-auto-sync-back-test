Both Mobile Device Management (MDM) for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Intune can be used to manage mobile devices in an organization. In fact, both MDM and Intune can be used in the same Microsoft 365 tenant.

Setting up both Intune and MDM enables you to decide which solution is best for specific users and their devices. If you have both options available, you can choose whether to manage a user's devices with either MDM for Microsoft 365 or the more feature-rich Intune solution.

There are key differences between the two solutions, each of which is described in the following table.

Deploy your internal line-of-business apps and apps in stores to users.
