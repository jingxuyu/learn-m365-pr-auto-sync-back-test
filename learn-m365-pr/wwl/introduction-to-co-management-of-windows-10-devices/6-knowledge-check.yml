  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is interested in transitioning from Configuration Manager to a Co-management solution. One of the benefits of Co-management that attracted Holly is its ability to set up and pre-configure new Windows 10 devices, getting them ready for productive use. The Co-management technology that provides this feature will reduce the time, resources, costs, and complexity associated with deploying, managing, and retiring or recycling devices. It will also create a better experience for end users. Which Co-management technology provides these benefits?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows AutoPilot"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Windows AutoPilot is a collection of technologies used to set up and pre-configure new Windows 10 devices, getting them ready for productive use. AutoPilot reduces the time, resources, costs, and complexity associated with deploying, managing, and retiring or recycling devices. It also creates a better experience for end users."

All of Lucerne's current Windows 10 devices that are managed by Configuration Manager are joined to AD DS. What other task must Patti complete to enable Co-management at Lucerne Publishing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Install the Configuration Manager agent on each Windows 10 device"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Since the Windows 10 devices are already managed by Configuration Manager, they must already have the Configuration Manager client installed. Try again."
    - content: "Sync on-premises AD DS to Azure AD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Co-management requires that Windows 10 devices are joined to AD DS, and on-premises AD DS is synced to Azure AD."
    - content: "Install Windows AutoPilot on each Windows 10 device"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item is a benefit of Co-management when you install Intune. It's not a requirement to implementing Co-management. Try again."
