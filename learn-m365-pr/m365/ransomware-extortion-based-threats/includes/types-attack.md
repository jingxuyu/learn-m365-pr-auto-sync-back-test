When ransomware attacks are mentioned in the news, various terms will be mentioned. Having an awareness of some of these key headline terms is useful to gain a better insight into what has happened.

## Human / Commodity Ransomware

Traditionally all ransomware relied on lapses of judgment to trick people into opening files, which installed malicious software (malware) on machines and the intended target was not known, this is known as **Commodity ransomware**. As ransomware attacks have become a complete business for criminals, they're seeking to maximize their income, so they're actively attacking specific businesses who are either in a position to pay a large ransom or are in an industry where they can't afford client information to be in the public domain, this is known as **Human-operated ransomware**.

In general attacks are becoming:

- More targeted on well-funded organizations.
- More targeted on organizations where the impact on customers will be most severe.
- More expensive as the ransom demands are rising dramatically.

**Example** - A human-operated attack occurred in the US, where a cyber-criminal managed to gain control of the computer system controlling the drinking water of a major city and was able to increase the levels of sodium hydroxide in the water to dangerous levels.

The following will explain the main types of attack, how they work, and typical symptoms.

## Ransom distributed denial of service attacks

Ransom distributed denial-of-services (DDoS) attack is when legitimate users can't access their normal systems because the system has been flooded with spurious traffic from a cybercriminal. The actor keeps sending requests to the target or network until the system effectively crashes. There are variations of the simple Denial-of-Service attack so you may hear terms such as:

- Smurf Attack.
- SYN Flood.

In essence, they all work by flooding a company with spurious requests to the network until the service is overwhelmed. A ransom would then be demanded to enable the company to use its systems. Sometimes, just preventing a company from carrying out its legitimate work can be enough of a reward.

Symptoms of an attack are likely to be:

- Taking a long time to open files.
- Websites taking very long times to load.
- Websites not loading or being unavailable.

**Example:** A European gambling company was hit by the biggest and most complex attack ever recorded, luckily it was stopped before any ransom was paid, but in another case a high-profile on-line shopping site was subject to an attack, which lasted three days.

## Encryption and locking malware attacks

Encryption ransomware attacks are where the cybercriminal adds extra code to files to prevent them being accessed on the users IT system; this is known as encryption. Once the ransomware has downloaded a message will appear on the screen informing the user of the ransom demand.

When files are encrypted, they're locked down by the cybercriminal and can't be opened until the ransom is paid.

The ransomware can be downloaded onto a system via several different routes

- Social Engineering Attacks.
- Security vulnerabilities.

### Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering attacks rely on users to activate the attack. Although not strictly ransomware attacks, they can cause a user to download suspicious files that could contain malicious ransomware, which could lead to a ransomware attack.

There are three main types of social engineering attacks:

- Phishing
- Vishing
- Smishing

#### Phishing

Phishing uses email or websites to solicit personal information from individual, which then allows the cybercriminal to gain access to unauthorized areas, such as bank accounts or other accounts. The email or website will look very professional and will often pretend to come from legitimate organizations and will take advantage of current events to play on public sympathies. Although phishing is often used to extract money from users by trickery, the emails can contain attachments, which once opened can run ransomware that can lead to a ransomware attack. It's estimated the 90% of all data breaches are because of a phishing attack, highlighting the fact that the weakest link in any IT system is the users.

**Example:** In 2016 a hacker organization started sending emails with a Word attachment. Once opened, it encouraged users to enable macros. Enabling the macros installed the malicious ransomware and launched a virus called Locky which encrypted files. A link then took you to a website, which demanded payment via bitcoin to release the files.

#### Vishing

Vishing uses voice communications to deceive a victim. The caller may pretend to be from a legitimate organization and come across as sincere and believable to extract sensitive information or encourage a caller to phone a fake number to verify account or other security information. This method is unlikely to lead to a ransomware attack but is commonly used to trick users into revealing bank account information to extract funds.

**Example:** A caller may ring to say you're due a tax rebate and before it can be processed, it's necessary to verify the account details that the rebate will be paid into. Once you've divulged your personal details, your account will then be emptied.

#### Smishing

Smishing uses text messaging to try to exploit people. The messages contain links to sites, which open onto fraudulent sites imitating legitimate sites. Although often used to extract money from users, links on site can entice users to download files, which can then run ransomware, which can lead to a ransomware attack.

Individuals are often the weak link that allows someone to gain access to a computer and from there gain access to an entire system.

**Example: Simple** texts pretending to be from delivery companies, claiming that they've tried to deliver a parcel and demanding a payment to redeliver the parcel. Simple tricks like this are easy to fall prey to if you genuinely are expecting a parcel and could have missed the delivery

### Security vulnerabilities

Any ransomware has the potential to be exploit any gaps in security. Just as a house can have a door left unlocked or a window not securely fastened, cybercriminals are looking to find ways into systems that haven't been locked properly, which is why it's important to install any security updates on any hardware or software.

**Example:** In 2021, an attack was made on a major software company that affected up to 60,000 private companies and nine government agencies in the United States, and thousands more globally as attackers exploited a vulnerability on its system.

## Leakware attacks

Also known as **exfiltration attacks**, these attacks combine a standard attack, which encrypts data, with the theft of data. Normally, very specific companies or individuals are targeted where the threat of data being made public could be very damaging. The cybercriminals will also start emailing the clients, business partners, or other individuals who could be affected if the data were to be made public to put extra pressure on the victim to pay.

Even if payment is made, it's doubtful whether all information is returned, as data could be sold in the black market and used to hold the victim ransom again.

**Example:** A major computer hardware company was attacked by a cybercriminal group called REvil, which resulted in data being leaked into the public domain and $50M in ransom being paid.
