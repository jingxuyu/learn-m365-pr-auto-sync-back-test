- **Modernization scanner** – Use the SharePoint modernization scanner to prepare your classic SharePoint sites for modernization for Viva Topics.
- **Transform to Modern** – Classic SharePoint sites with classic pages: wiki pages, web part pages, blog pages or publishing pages will need to transform to a modern user interface with Modern SharePoint.

But if they edit or delete content included in the retention policy, a copy of the content is automatically retained.
- **Sensitivity labels** – Microsoft Purview Information Protection (MIP) solution to let you classify and protect your data, while ensuring user productivity and collaboration.
- **Data Loss Prevention** – With a data loss prevention (DLP) policy in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365.
