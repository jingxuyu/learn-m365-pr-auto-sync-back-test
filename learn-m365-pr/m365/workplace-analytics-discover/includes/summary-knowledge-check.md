Workplace Analytics is a cloud-based solution that uses the power of Microsoft 365 collaboration data to provide rich, actionable awareness into how your organization spends its time, the ways people network, and the effectiveness of team collaboration.

With Workplace Analytics features, you can:

- Explore research-based behavioral insights into how things get done using the solution areas in the Home page.
- Analyze insights using the Explore dashboards.
- Run flexible queries using existing and custom filtered metrics to extract data for tailored analysis.
- Select targeted change plans to improve focus, collaboration, well-being, and seller success.
- Use Settings to validate uploaded data, identify dates for analysis and define which meetings, if any, to exclude.

Privacy is key. Workplace Analytics looks at header level metadata, not content, attachments, or anything considered sensitive in nature.

- Identify how Workplace Analytics can help improve collaboration behaviors in your organization.
- Recognize the sources of data that are used in Workplace Analytics.
