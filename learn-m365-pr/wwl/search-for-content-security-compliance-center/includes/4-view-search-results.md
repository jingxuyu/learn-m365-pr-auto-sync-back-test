Once an organization creates and runs a Content search, it must then decide what to do with the search results. Organizations typically complete one or more combinations of the following tasks:

 -  Preview the search results
 -  View statistics for the search results
 -  Export the search results
 -  Export a search report

The first two tasks are examined in this unit. The next unit describes the two exporting tasks.

### Preview the search results

After running a Content search, you can preview a sample of the results returned by the search. Previewing items returned by the search query can help determine if the search is returning the results you hope for, or if you need to change the search query and rerun the search.

To preview a sample of results returned by a search:

1.  In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, go to the **Content search** page.
2.  Select search to display the flyout page.
3.  On the bottom of the flyout page, select **Review sample**.

    A page is displayed containing a sample of the search results.
4.  Select an item to view its contents in the reading pane. In the following image, notice that keywords from the search query are highlighted when you preview items.

#### How the search result samples are selected

A maximum of 1,000 randomly selected items are available to preview. Besides being randomly selected, items available for preview must also meet the following criteria:

 -  A maximum of 100 items from a single content location (a mailbox or a site) can be previewed. As a result, it's possible that less than 1,000 items might be available for preview. For example, if you search four mailboxes and the search returns 1,500 estimated items, only 400 will be available for preview because only 100 items from each mailbox can be previewed.<br>
 -  For mailbox items, only email messages are available to preview. Items like tasks, calendar items, and contacts can't be previewed.<br>
 -  For site items, only documents are available to preview. Items like folders, lists, or list attachments can't be previewed.<br>

### View statistics for the search results

After creating and running a Content search, you can view statistics about the estimated search results. These statistics include:

 -  A summary of the search results, which is similar to the summary of the estimated search results displayed on the search flyout page.
 -  The query statistics, such as the number of content locations with items that match the search query.
 -  The identity of content locations that have the most matching items.

The keywords list can be used to configure a search to return statistics for each keyword in a search query. These statistics enable you to compare the number of results returned by each keyword in a query.

The search statistics can also be downloaded to a CSV file. You can then use the filtering and sorting features in Excel to compare results, and prepare reports for your search results.

To display statistics for a Content search:<br>

1.  In the Microsoft 365 compliance center, select **Show all &gt; Content search,** and then select a search to display the flyout page.
2.  On the flyout page of the selected search, select the **Search statistics** tab.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/search-statistics-4c9bc086.png" alt-text="screenshot of the search statistics window after selecting the search statistics option on flyout page of the selected search":::
    

The **Search statistics** tab contains the following sections that display different types of statistics about the search:

 -  **Search content.** This section displays a graphical summary of the estimated items returned by the search. This summary indicates the number of items that match the search criteria. This information gives you an idea about the estimated number of items returned by the search.
 -  **Condition report.** This section displays statistics about the search query and the number of estimated items that matched different parts of the search query. You can use these statistics to analyze the number of items that match each component of search query. This information can help you refine the search criteria and, if necessary, narrow the scope of the report. You can also download a copy of this report in CSV format.
 -  **Top locations.** This section displays statistics about the specific content locations with the most items returned by the search. The top 1,000 locations are displayed. You can also download a copy of this report in CSV format.
