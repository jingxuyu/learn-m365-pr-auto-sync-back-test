### Home page insights example scenario

You are an HR executive at Contoso Corporation, and have been asked to work with your team to determine if managers are spending enough time developing employees in the organization. Using Workplace Analytics, you navigate to the Home page, select the **Develop effective managers** outcome, and scroll down to the **Promote coaching and development** insight. There, you find that over 60 percent of employees at Contoso get less than 15 minutes of one-on-one time with their manager in a month, indicating a need for more coaching.

In the **Take action** section of the insight, you can select **See your insights** to see impactful next steps you can take to drive change in your organization. For example, in **Develop effective managers > Increase frequency of coaching > See your insights**, you'll see recommendations, such as scheduling recurring one-on-one meetings, and groups that could benefit the most from these recommendations. This example also provides a link to **Explore the stats** for more analysis.

>[!NOTE]
>In addition to recommendations in the **Take action** section, you might also see links to **Explore the stats**, **Explore in Power BI**, or the option to create **Plans** and track their success. The combination of these depends on the insights and your assigned role.

**Explore the stats** is a quick way to look at metrics summarized by groups over time. While the Home page shows high-level insights related to business outcomes, **Explore the stats** cover a wider range of metrics.

At the top right of the page, select **Settings and filters** to open **Page settings**. In Page settings, you can change the date range of the data, how the measured employees are grouped, add filters, and change the maximum number of groups shown in the data.

### Explore the stats example scenario

As an executive on the HR team, you learned from a recent engagement survey that some employees at Contoso are not feeling empowered in their work. You decide to dive deeper into metrics relating to manager-employee relationships to investigate opportunities for improving manager effectiveness.

In **Develop effective managers** > **Promote coaching and development** > **See your insights**, you select **Explore the stats** to view the **Management and coaching** dashboard. You would like a recent snapshot of the data, so in the upper right corner of the dashboard, you confirm the date range in **Settings and filters** is set to the last three months, group by **Organization**, and select **Apply**. In the **Meeting hours with direct manager present** chart, you notice that over half of the Sales group's meeting time includes their manager, indicating an opportunity to simultaneously empower employees through delegation and free up manager time for strategic tasks.
