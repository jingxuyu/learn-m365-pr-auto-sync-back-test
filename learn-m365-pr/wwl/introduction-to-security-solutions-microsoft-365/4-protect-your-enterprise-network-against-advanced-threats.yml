  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to implement Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Holly likes the fact that Defender for Endpoint combines Microsoft's robust cloud service and Windows 10 technology. Which Windows 10 technology does Defender for Endpoint use that will enable it to collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to Contoso's private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?"
    choices:
    - content: "Threat intelligence"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Threat intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when they're observed in collected sensor data. Try again."
    - content: "Cloud security analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Cloud security analytics uses big-data, device-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Microsoft 365), and online assets. Behavioral signals are then translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats. Try again."
    - content: "Endpoint behavioral sensors"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint."
