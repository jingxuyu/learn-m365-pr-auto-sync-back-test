There are many resources available to OKR Champions and having a sense of what these are and when to deploy them creates a stronger program (and reduces work for the Champion!). Generally, resources fall into three buckets: pre-program kickoff, program mechanics and future state.

## Pre-program kickoff

Champions can help their teams get started with OKRs by sending out the New User Quick Start Guide that provides instructions on how to log in and set up their profile. If the OKR admin has not already done so, this is a great time for OKR Champions to send out an email introducing the program and future expectations for employees. The Pilot Kickoff Comms or the Implementation and Rollout OKR Communication Plan are useful email templates with this information and links that OKR Champions can fill and send out.

## The OKR Cycle

**At the beginning of the program** once users have their accounts set up, Champions should direct their teams to the Get Started with Viva Goals learning path. This course introduces OKRs as a goal-setting framework, shows how to write great OKRs, and provides software basics for using the platform. Champions can also send out the OKR Writing Cheat Sheet and 81 OKR Examples to help users get a strong sense for how to write effective OKRs. For users who appreciate guidebooks, the Adoption Guide is another good accompaniment to the learning path.

**Midway through the OKR cycle**, OKR Champions can use the Pilot Midpoint Check-in Comms Template to check in with their teams to ensure that everyone understands the process, is regularly checking in to their OKRs, and remembers to do so.

As users approach **the end of the first OKR cycle**, OKR Champions should provide guidance and further direction on this process. OKR Champions can refer users to [Scoring and Closing OKRs](https://help.ally.io/articles/1796003-scoring-and-closing-okrs) as a reference for beginning this process.

## Future state

As organizations move through several OKR cycles, OKR Champions can help them continue to grow by communicating where improvement is possible and examples of what this might look like. The OKR Maturity Model helps companies identify their level of OKR maturity and what to strive for in the future.

Knowing what resources are available and when to leverage them empowers OKR Champions to further empower their team. With the exception of the Adoption Guide and OKR Examples, you can find all of these resources in our Customer Success Toolkit.
