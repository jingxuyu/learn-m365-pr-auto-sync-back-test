Microsoft Teams provides a digital environment for team conversations and collaboration. Teams in Microsoft Teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests. Channels are where the work actually gets done â€”where text, audio, and video conversations open to the whole team happen, where files are shared, and where apps are added. In this module, you will learn how to have conversations in channels and chats, share and collaborate with files, and use email to communicate with the members of a channel. You'll also learn how to customize which teams, channels, and chats you see in your Teams environment and manage their notifications.

The following video provides an overview of how you can work with your team using Teams:
