First up – the presenter. Part of your role on the virtual summit event team is training your presenters. Learn about pre-event best practices and what tools can help them present with ease and optimize their digital content.

## Set up your hardware

:::image type="content" source="../media/camera.png" alt-text="Quality hardware, such as a good video camera, can make all the difference to your presentation":::

Before you can successfully present a virtual event, you need to start with your hardware – the tools you need. Presenters should have the following hardware for meetings:

-	**An external microphone.** Audio is the most important portion of a presentation. Presenters should plan to have a microphone that is external to their computer. Avoid using built-in laptop speakers and microphones for the best audio. Consider using a microphone stand to position the mic close to your mouth to reduce reverberations from the room. A pop shield is useful to avoid the distortion associated with plosive vocal sounds such as "P" and "B".
- **A web camera.** Select a web camera that delivers a minimum 720p (ideally 1080p) resolution. Position the camera at or slightly above eye level – it's important to engage attendees by looking at the camera.

For the best quality, review your device options at [https://aka.ms/TeamsDevices](https://aka.ms/TeamsDevices).

> [!TIP]
> If you can, use at least two monitors during meetings. You can share the screen from one monitor and use the other monitor to keep notes, the Teams window, and other applications visible to you without distracting other participants.

Nothing is worse during a virtual event than jumpy audio or video. To ensure the best network bandwidth between your computer and your router, use an Ethernet cable to plug directly into your router. Don't rely on your wireless network. You might have to set up your presenting space close to your router or invest in a long Ethernet cable. If you’re using a laptop, remember to plug into a power outlet - don't expect your laptop battery to last for the full duration of the call.

## Set up your physical environment

Now, let’s optimize your environment. 

### Location and lighting

Think about your presentation space. Arrange your setup so that your face is in good, even light, with no harsh backlight. Consider using an LED light to light your face evenly. Don’t sit with a window or other bright source behind you; your webcam will compensate, which will cause your face to look dim or dark. Reduce clutter and distracting or bright images in the background to keep the audience focused on you.

### Wardrobe

Your environment includes your appearance. Consider what you plan on wearing and how that will show up to your audience. Make sure your wardrobe matches the tone of your presentation. Choose solid colors and avoid stripes, plaid, prints, or patterns because they can cause strobing effects in the video. If your producer wants to use green screen effects, avoid any green in your clothing. You don’t want to disappear into your background! Unless otherwise specified, shirts with logos or trademarks should be avoided. Also avoid noisy jewelry that can be distracting to the viewer.

Finally, check around you. A messy desk or room can be distracting for attendees. Take a moment to review everything that's included in the camera's field of view and remove clutter, inappropriate items, or other items you think might distract your attendees.

## Configure your computer

Once your environment is set up, it's time to configure your computer, including the hardware, operating system, Teams, and other applications.

:::image type="content" source="../media/configure-computer.png" alt-text="Think carefully about how you can configure your operating system, hardware, and applications.":::

Next, make sure that your operating system and software are up to date. Check for updates well before the event, especially for Teams and your browser. You don’t want to have a mandatory update and restart message pop-up mid-presentation.

If you’re planning to share your screen, consider the following changes to reduce distractions: 

- Clean up items on your desktop.
- Hide the taskbar.
-	Clear your browser history and close any unrelated tabs.
-	If you need to display a web page during your meeting, preload it in a browser tab before you start – this technique will help ensure they’re instantaneously available.
-	Run only the applications you need for your presentation. Close everything else.
-	Turn off notifications, from both the operating system and apps.
-	Disable automatic updates.

## Optimize your content for digital delivery

Connecting with an audience and being able to present with ease are important skills to develop, especially for virtual events. Your audience is most likely at home watching you on a small screen. Virtual event sessions are much more intimate and on-demand now. Speak with energy and with a tone of voice that you would normally have, as if you’re holding a conversation with close colleagues. Remember to engage the attendees by looking into the camera when you can. Keeping your content tight, focused, and trying not to repeat yourself also helps the audience stay engaged.

Also, try these techniques:

-	Identify your central message and mention it in both the introduction and the summary.
-	Have a clear call to action within your presentation.
-	Use a mix of text, and images in your presentation.
-	Don’t read your slides to the audience. Use a bullet point format and add value with your expertise.
-	Rehearse timing to ensure you can adequately cover your content in the time provided.
-	Place housekeeping and resource slides at the beginning of the presentation, so you don't disrupt question and answer sessions at the end of the meeting.
-	Check how materials will be shared with participants at the end of the meeting.
-	If using PowerPoint, review settings under the **Slide Show** menu to customize your defaults.

You can also use the PowerPoint Presenter Coach to evaluate your presentation delivery. Presenter Coach lets you enter a rehearsal mode and analyzes your performance using AI assistance. The Coach can give feedback on:

-	Pacing.
-	Inclusive language and culturally insensitive phrases.
-	Filler words, such as "Um" and "Er", which can be distracting.

After your practice, the Coach provides a detailed report that you can use to improve your technique.

## Using the presentation tools

When it's time to present, join the meeting invite from Outlook or the full Teams desktop app. It's a good idea to make a note of the phone number and conference ID in the meeting invite so that you can dial into the meeting in case there is a connection loss.

> [!NOTE]
>You can only present in a live event from your Windows or Mac computer. Currently, presenting from a mobile device is not supported.

Once you are on the Teams call, turn on your microphone and camera, and share your desktop or presentation.

:::image type="content" source="../media/presentation-tools.png" alt-text="In the meeting, there are tools to enable your camera or microphone and to share your desktop.":::

If you're sharing your desktop, make sure the following items are hidden out of the way on a second monitor or minimized:

-	The Teams panel.
-	The Teams meeting chat window. It’s best to have the meeting chat on another monitor so that you can keep an eye on it for any communication from moderators, producers, or switching operations during your session.
-	Meeting notes and other apps that you need to use but don't want the attendees to see.

During the event, a red border indicates the presenter whose camera is enabled and shared.

In a Teams meeting, the most important tools for a presenter are:

-	**Share screen.** Share either an entire desktop, a specific application window, a PowerPoint presentation, or a whiteboard to draw on.
-	**Show meeting chat.** Display and respond to messages.
-	**Show participants.** Check who is present.
-	**Start recording.** Record the video and audio from a meeting. The Start recording button is in the More Actions menu. Recordings are helpful for participants to review on-demand after the scheduled event. You can access the recording in the meeting chat after the meeting ends.

In a Teams Live Event, you have some extra tools available during the meeting:

-	**Enable Chat Private.** Chat only with the event producers and moderators. Attendees don’t see these messages.
-	**Moderate the attendees’ Q&A.** Questions from attendees can be published to the entire audience, or they can be answered privately. You can also dismiss any redundant or out-of-context questions.
