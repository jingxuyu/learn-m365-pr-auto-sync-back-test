You want to make your Microsoft Teams environment more inclusive of people with disabilities. In this module, weâ€™ve looked at how to achieve this goal through features like transcript and captioning, providing access to sign language interpreters, enabling background effects, and more.

Without these Microsoft Teams features, users would have less flexibility in how they engage with your Teams environment. Instead, Microsoft Teams allows you to make your environment more flexible, and more inclusive as a result, through the variety of features that come built-in to Teams.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Implement captions and transcription for Microsoft Teams meetings and calls.
- Facilitate sign language interpreters in meetings.
- Enable background effects to reduce distractions in meetings.
- Implement features to enhance participation in Microsoft Teams meetings .
