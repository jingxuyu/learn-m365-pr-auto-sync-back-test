This module examined how to manage Windows desktop apps, Microsoft store apps, and Universal Windows Platform apps. You learned about app management using Configuration Manager and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The module also explored how you can use Mobile Application Management (MAM) in Intune to manage mobile apps.<br>

One of an administrator's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. You learned that this goal can be a challenge because:

 -  There are a wide range of device platforms and app types.
 -  Apps may need to be managed on both company devices and users' personal devices.
 -  Your network and your data must remain secure.

The module focused on how application management addresses these challenges. The module began by examining how to protect company data by using app protection policies. It then explored how apps can be managed using Configuration Manager, Intune, and Azure AD.

You learned that Configuration Manager is the recommended tool for deploying and managing desktop apps. It can also be used for deploying Microsoft Store for Business apps. Configuration Manager supports many app deployment features, such as app dependencies, supersedence, and deployment types. This design enables organizations to deploy different app types on different devices for the same user.

The module then examined Mobile Application Management (MAM) within Intune. You learned that by using MAM to manage mobile apps, Intune can protect organization data at the application level, including custom apps and store apps. MAM can be used on organization-owned devices and personal devices. When it's used with personal devices, only organization-related access and data are managed.

The module concluded by examining app management with Azure AD. Azure AD is a centralized identity system for the Microsoft cloud. It provides a single place to store user information that can then be used by all applications. You learned that Azure AD must be configured to integrate with an application so that it knows what apps are using it for identities.
