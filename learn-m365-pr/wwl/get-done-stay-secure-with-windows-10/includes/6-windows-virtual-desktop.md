Windows Virtual Desktop is a service that allows users to connect to a Windows desktop running in the cloud. They enjoy all the benefits of Windows desktop and Microsoft 365 apps, without the overhead of installing software on the local device.

Windows Virtual Desktop is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on Azure. Here's what you can do:

- Set up a **multi-session Windows 10 deployment** that delivers a full Windows 10 with scalability.
- **Virtualize Office 365 ProPlus** and optimize it to run in multi-user virtual scenarios.
- Provide **Windows 7 virtual desktops** with free Extended Security Updates.
- Bring your existing Remote Desktop Services (RDS) and Windows Server desktops and apps to **any computer**.
- **Virtualize** both desktops and apps.
- Manage Windows 10, Windows Server, and Windows 7 desktops and apps with a **unified management** experience.

For some situations, this gives the organizations significant benefits:

- **Deploy** Windows desktops and apps in minutes.
- **Scale** easily by provisioning access to data across devices fast.
- Provide access to data while adhering to **security and compliance regulations**.
- Gives users the **same look and feel** as running Office apps on a dedicated machine.
- The organization **pays only for what it uses** with the Azure Virtual Machines and Azure storage consumed by users.
- When your storage needs differ seasonally, you only pay for what you need when you need it.

Use Windows Virtual Desktop for specific needs, such as when security is important, as all data is stored on the server and cannot be left on a userâ€™s device.
