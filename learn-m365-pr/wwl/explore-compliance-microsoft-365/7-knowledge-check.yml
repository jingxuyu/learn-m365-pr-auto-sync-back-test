    choices:
    - content: "A Microsoft-managed control"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. For each cloud service, Microsoft implements and manages a set of controls as part of Microsoft's compliance with various standards and regulations. This item isn't an evaluation of a template that starts an organization's scoring process."
    - content: "As assessment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An assessment is an evaluation of a template that starts the scoring process for an organization. Assessments group the actions necessary to meet the requirements of a standard, regulation, or law.

    - content: "A Customer-managed control"

  - content: "Tailspin Toys has just deployed Microsoft 365. It's now analyzing its compliance needs. As such, it's trying to determine its current state of compliance. Which of the following actions should it complete to help it understand its compliance posture?"
    choices:
    - content: "Deploy Microsoft's built-in alert policies"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These policies will help Tailspin Toys identify permissions abuse by administrators, malware activity, potential internal and external threats, and information governance risks. However, they aren't the first thing it should do to determine its current state of compliance."
    - content: "Classify and protect sensitive data with sensitivity labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Sensitivity labels help classify and protect sensitive data by enforcing message encryption and usage restrictions, applying visual markings, and protecting information across platforms and devices. However, they aren't the first thing it should do to determine its current state of compliance."
    - content: "Check its compliance score in Compliance Manager"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It’s difficult to know where to go if you don’t know where you are. To meet its compliance needs, an organization must understand its current level of risk. It can do so by checking its compliance score in Compliance Manager. Once it knows its compliance posture given its compliance score, it can then complete actions to help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards, such as deploying Microsoft's built-in alert policies and creating sensitivity labels."
