You work for an enterprise-level organization. Users in your organization rely on audio and video features to hold meetings in Microsoft Teams, which has become a critical service for your organization. 

Good quality audio and video allows users to focus on their work, and not the software. Poor audio or video causes issues such as calls dropping, sound breaking up, or video freezing. This leads to frustration and can discourage people from using Microsoft Teams. Audio and video quality is affected both by the way that users work with Microsoft Teams, and IT activities such as network configuration.

In this module we will look at how to monitor and troubleshoot audio and video quality issues, together with emergency calling and direct routing issues.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Understand and troubleshoot media flow.
- Use the Call Quality Dashboard to investigate audio and video issues.
- Troubleshoot emergency calling issues.
- Troubleshoot direct routing issues.
