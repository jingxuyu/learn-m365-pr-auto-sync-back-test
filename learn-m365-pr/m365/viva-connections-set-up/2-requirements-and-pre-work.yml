    questions:
    - content: "You want to be sure that the Viva Connections Feed has a steady source of organizational news. What is the best site to distribute organizational news using Viva Connections?"
      choices:
      - content: "A Team site"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A Team site is best used for a group of people
            working on the same project or who require shared
            productivity tools. A Team site isn't ideal for delivering
            company-wide news."
      - content: "A project site"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "SharePoint offers two types of sites:/ communication sites or team sites."
      - content: "The home site or other organizational news sites"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The home site and other organizational news sites
            are the best way to deliver information to the entire
            organization. Home sites automatically get flagged as a
            source of organizational news, which will distribute news on
            the home sites and other sites users follow."
    - content: "What are the minimum requirements for deploying Viva Connections?"
      choices:
      - content: "Your organization must have a home site and customized global navigation to set up Viva Connections. Though not required, it's highly recommended that sites and pages that get links to the Viva Connections experience are modernized for the best viewing experience."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You need both a home site and global navigation
            enabled to successfully deploy Viva Connections."
      - content: "Your organization must gather a team of tech experts to deploy Viva Connections."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Deploying Viva Connections, and planning
            and building it, takes a team of people with various
            knowledge and experience, not just technical."
      - content: "Your organization only requires a home site to deploy Viva Connections."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Although your organization must have a home site
            to deploy Viva Connections, you'll also need to customize
            global navigation. A home site alone isn't enough to
            successfully deploy Viva Connections."
    - content: "While preparing your companyâ€™s Intranet, what is the purpose of enabling global navigation?"
      choices:
      - content: "It allows users to access popular portals and content from the landing experience on a desktop device or from the Resources tab on a mobile device."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Global navigation is an essential step in setting
            up Viva Connections Resources."
      - content: "It provides access to external resources from other Viva Connections users."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Global navigation is a setting that enables users
            to see and access information that is useful to their
            personal needs. It isn't a tool that connects to external
            users or resources."
      - content: "It adds a new card on the Dashboard."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Global navigation is a customizable feature that
            is unrelated to the Dashboard."
