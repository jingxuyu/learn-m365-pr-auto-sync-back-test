After an organization creates the user accounts for its Microsoft 365 tenant, it can then create groups for collaboration between users, both inside and outside the company. In Exchange Online, groups enable organizations to distribute email to multiple users. In SharePoint Online, groups are used to support cross-team collaboration. People from outside your organization can be added to a group as long as this permission has been enabled by the administrator.
