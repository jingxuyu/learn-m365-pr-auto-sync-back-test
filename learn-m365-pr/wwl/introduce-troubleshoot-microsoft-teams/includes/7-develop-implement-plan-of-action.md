Your action plan typically consists of the following steps:

- Develop a plan of action:

   - Analyze available data
   - Review the documentation
   - Build a test environment
   - Consider the impact of changes
   - Plan for rollback

- Implement a plan of action:

   - Implement in a test environment
   - Consult change management
   - Resolve a problem
   - Monitor and evaluate a resolution
   - Report and document a problem’s resolution

## Develop a plan of action

The following table examines the steps involved in developing your plan of action. 

| Step                           | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Analyze available data         | Helps you  ensure that you’ve determined the probable cause correctly. |
| Review the documentation       | Review any  documentation that relates to the fix that you’re planning. |
| Build a test environment       | If your proposed fix involves significant reconfiguration  work, this might affect the user’s productivity. Consider building a test  environment, or using a demonstration tenant to test your proposed fix. |
| Consider the impact of changes | If you must  perform significant reconfiguration to resolve problems, these changes might  affect many areas of your organization. |
| Plan for rollback              | If you  implement a fix and it does not resolve the problem as you hoped, you might  consider rolling back the fix. |

 

## Implement a plan of action

The following table examines the steps involved in implementing your plan of action. 

| Step                                        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Implement in  a test environment            | For complex,  organizational-wide problems, implement your plan of action in a test  environment, if possible. |
| Consult change management                   | If your organization uses a change management procedure, you  must consult the relevant documentation before you attempt any significant  changes. |
| Resolve a problem                           | Having tested  your proposed fix, apply the fix to your production environment. |
| Monitor and  evaluate a resolution          | If a fix  takes time to complete and involves a number of stages, you should monitor its  progress. Evaluate the data that you collect during this monitoring process.  This can help you determine if the fix is successful or not. |
| Report and  document a problem’s resolution | You must  document all the steps that you took and then document the results. |
