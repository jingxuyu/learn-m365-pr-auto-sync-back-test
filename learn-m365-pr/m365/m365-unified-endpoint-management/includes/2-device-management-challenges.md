In today’s workplace, IT departments typically support multiple devices that are configured in different ways  . Android and iOS operating systems on phones and tablets, Windows 10 and macOS on PCs, and users’ own devices must all be supported. All these devices must conform to organizational standards of security and device health. In addition, IT pros must be able to configure the various types of devices to support organizational apps and features, such as VPNs, email settings, and updates.

Laptops, tablets, or other mobile devices are the primary devices used in enterprise environments today. These devices present unique management challenges to enterprise IT departments. These challenges might include:   

**Mobile devices connecting to unsecured networks.** Mobile devices frequently connect to networks outside the organization. Organizational computers often connect to Wi-Fi access points in public places, such as airports and cafés. Using Wi-Fi access points, hackers can capture network traffic, and try to insert malware into your browsing sessions. 

**Mobile devices intermittently connecting to organizational networks.** Mobile devices can be difficult to manage using tools such as Group Policy, as group policy assumes devices are always connected to the organizational network.

**Backing up data.** When a device is connected to the organizational network, users are more likely to use documents in central locations, such as file shares and SharePoint sites. These locations are typically backed up. Mobile devices, including laptops, may not regularly connect and use content from central locations. So, the data is likely stored only on the device. If a device is lost, stolen, or suffers a hardware failure, then the unique copy of that organizational data may be lost.

**Mobile devices more easily lost or stolen.** The average cost of replacing a stolen device can exceed the cost of the device. This cost is higher because the organization must configure the new device, and determine what data was lost or stolen. In some cases, that data exists only on the mobile device, and is then lost to the organization.

**Compromised devices connect to the internal network.** A mobile device infected with malware can leak data, and introduce the malware into the organization. Organizations must treat mobile devices as possible malware vectors.

**Many mobile devices are user owned.** Personal devices are a challenge to organizations. IT departments need to find a balance between allowing access to applications and data with users wanting to use their own devices. When considering a mobile device support policy, ask the following questions:
- Is the device owned by the user or the organization?
- Should you permit user-owned devices to access sensitive applications and data? Or, only allow access if the owner agrees to have the device managed by IT?
- What actions can organizations take to protect data stored on the device if the device is lost, or if the user leaves the company?

Mobile devices are more likely than larger devices, such as laptops, to be lost or stolen. This loss can mean that private and organization-specific data potentially becomes public. Organizations that allow mobile devices access to sensitive data must have policies in place to address these scenarios.
