The old saying that you should "Plan your work and work your plan" is especially relevant when implementing Microsoft 365. Once you have finished planning your Microsoft 365 tenant experience, it's then time to configure that experience. For Microsoft 365, the configuration process includes:

 *  Setting up your organizational profile
 *  Managing your tenant subscriptions
 *  Managing your services and add-ins
 *  Finalizing your tenant configuration

This module examines each of these tasks that must be completed to successfully configure your Microsoft 365 experience.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 *  Configure your company’s organization profile which is essential for setting up for your company’s tenant
 *  Maintain minimum subscription requirements for your company
 *  Manage your services and add-ins by assigning more licenses, purchasing more storage, and so on
 *  Create a checklist that enables you to confirm your Microsoft 365 tenant meets your business needs
