The Workplace Analytics app as part of Viva Insights is a cloud-based solution that uses the power of Microsoft 365 collaboration data for creating analysis about how your organization spends its time, the ways people network, and the effectiveness of team collaboration.

With the Workplace Analytics features, you can:

* See business outcomes and their related research-based behavioral insights that show how things get done in your organization starting with the Home page.
* Use the Explore the stats, Explore in Power BI, and Plans options for more in-depth analysis specific to your organization's data.
* Use the Query designer's templates and queries to jump-start your analysis and customize them for more focused or in-depth analysis.
* Analyze a specific business process with the Business process analysis feature.
* Compare metrics between groups with the Peer analysis feature.
* Select targeted change plans to improve focus, collaboration, wellbeing, and sales success.
* Use the Controls pages to validate uploaded data sources and to set up analyst settings, system defaults, and privacy settings.

Privacy is key. Workplace Analytics only uses header level metadata. Attachments and text in the body of email and meetings are never used. Furthermore, rights-managed, confidential, and private email and meetings are excluded altogether.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

* Identify how Workplace Analytics can help improve collaboration behaviors in your organization.
* Recognize the sources of data that are used in Workplace Analytics.
* Navigate and use the features in Workplace Analytics.
* Understand tasks and considerations for setting up Workplace Analytics and managing privacy.
