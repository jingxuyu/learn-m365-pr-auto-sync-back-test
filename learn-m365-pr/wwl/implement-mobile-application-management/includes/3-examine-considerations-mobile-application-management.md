Intune-managed apps are enabled with a rich set of mobile application protection policies and allow you to:

 -  Restrict copy-and-paste and save-as functions
 -  Configure web links to open inside the Intune Managed Browser app
 -  Enable multi-identity use and app-level conditional access
 -  Apply data loss prevention policies without managing the user's device
 -  Enable app protection without requiring enrollment
 -  Enable app protection on devices managed with 3rd party EMM tools

Intune-managed apps can also enable app protection without requiring enrollment, giving you the choice to apply data loss prevention policies without managing the user's device. One challenge many Intune admins face is keeping on top of which apps do or donâ€™t support MAM policies.
