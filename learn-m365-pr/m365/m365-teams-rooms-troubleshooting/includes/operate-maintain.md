What are the day-to-day operations that you should consider to keep Teams Rooms in great shape?

## Consider day-to-day operations

- Always make sure that Windows and the Teams Rooms app are set to auto update. This is handled automatically every morning starting at 2:01 via a scheduled task. 
- Firmware updates may require manual effort, but work with your OEM to see if they have tools to automate the download and update of firmware for their devices.
- Teams admin center can be used to view statistics on the reliability of your meetings and the availability of your devices. Teams admin center can show if a device is unreachable and then you can work to resolve the issue.
- You can use Microsoft Endpoint Manager or System Center Operations Manager to keep track of your devices.
- It's a good idea to inspect the rooms to validate that the equipment is still working as expected. When inspecting the rooms, make sure that cabling is still tightly connected and things haven't come loose. Are the cameras connected and functional? Make test calls in each room to make sure the audio and video is working as expected.
- You should confirm that Teams Rooms is signed in. You can do that simply by looking at the console and making sure it's ready to join a meeting.
- Be sure to wipe down the console touchscreen to keep it clean and clear from fingerprints.
- Also take this time to check if HDMI ingress cables are damaged. These cables can be used many times a day and can degrade over time.
