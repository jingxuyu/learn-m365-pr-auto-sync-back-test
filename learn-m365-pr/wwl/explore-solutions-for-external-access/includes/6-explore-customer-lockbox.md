As a Microsoft 365 admin, you can use customer lockbox requests to control how a Microsoft support engineer accesses your company's data. Sometimes if you run into an issue, you may need a Microsoft support engineer to help fix it. In some cases, the support engineer will require access to your company's Microsoft 365 data to troubleshoot and fix the issue. Customer lockbox requests enable you to control whether to give the support engineer access to your data. There's also an expiration time on the request, and content access is removed after the support engineer has fixed the issue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer lockbox functionality is only used when troubleshooting requires access to your Microsoft 365 content. For most support cases, resolution doesn't require the use of customer lockbox access.

Customer lockbox is included in the Office 365 Enterprise E5 plan.

### Example of customer lockbox request

The following steps provide an overview of the customer lockbox process:

1.  Someone at your company or school has an issue with their Microsoft 365 mailbox.
2.  After some troubleshooting, you can't fix the issue and open a support request with Microsoft support.
3.  The support engineer reviews your service request and needs access to your Exchange Online content to repair the issue.
4.  The support engineer logs into the customer lockbox request tool and sends you an email letting you know there's a pending customer lockbox request. All requests are reviewed and approved by Microsoft support managers before you get the request.
5.  The customer lockbox request tool sends you an email letting you know there's a pending lockbox request. If you reject or don't approve the request in 12 hours, access is automatically revoked.
6.  You log into the Microsoft 365 admin center and approve the request. Keep in mind that no links are included in the customer lockbox email that require you to login to Microsoft 365.
7.  The support engineer gets the approval message, logs into Exchange Online and fixes the issues. Once the support engineer starts the process, they have four hours to fix the issue before access is revoked.
8.  As soon as the issue is fixed, the customer lockbox request is closed, and access is revoked.
