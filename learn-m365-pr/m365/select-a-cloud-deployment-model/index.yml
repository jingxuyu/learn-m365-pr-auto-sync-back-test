  title: Select a cloud deployment model - Learn
  description: Learn how companies can work purely in the cloud (“cloud-only”) or connect existing on-premises systems to the cloud to extend the value of their legacy infrastructure (“hybrid”). You’ll see how these two different service models require different approaches to migration, and then you’ll review a few scenarios that demonstrate when to choose one type of migration over the other. Finally, we’ll review some considerations for how an organization approaches migrating systems with older versions of Office, Windows, and Office Server to Microsoft 365.
