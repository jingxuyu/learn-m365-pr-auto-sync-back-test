Transitioning from traditional to modern device management doesn't happen overnight. In most environments, it's a lengthy process. Management must be moved to the cloud from on-premises, agent-based management. It must also use standards-based MDM.

Co-management is often the first step of this transition. It's a practical way of gradually migrating to the cloud, which minimizes risk of the migration. It also enables organizations to experience the benefits of modern management without leaving traditional management. Co-management enables organizations to manage their devices the same they always have, but it also provides cloud-based features, such as Conditional Access, MFA, and Windows AutoPilot. This design simplifies and smooths the transition.

Co-management isn't static. When organizations enable co-management, they can start using it on just a few pilot devices. After they get familiar and more confident with its benefits, they can expand membership in their pilots and move more workloads to Intune.

After an organization's environment is ready, it can enable co-management for all Windows 10 devices and for all workloads. It can also complete more complex deployments by using Configuration Manager. The final goal will be to fully manage your devices by using MDM and Intune.

In this module, you'll examine how to transfer workload management from Configuration Manager to Intune. Once that transition is complete, you'll need to monitor your co-management solution. The module will then explore how to complete the transition by validating the compliance of your co-managed devices.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Modify the co-management settings involving pilot collection, automatic enrollment in Intune, and workloads.
 -  Transfer workload management from Configuration Manager to Intune.
 -  Monitor your co-management solution.
 -  Validate the compliance of your co-managed devices.
