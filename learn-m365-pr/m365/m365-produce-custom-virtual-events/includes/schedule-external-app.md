## Schedule a Teams Live Event for use with an external application 
Now that you understand how the production process works, let's move on to scheduling a Teams Live Event. You’ll use the live event to produce the executive panel and to get a link for the event that you can share with attendees in the formal invitation. 
## How to schedule your Live Event from Teams 
To get started, create a **Live event** in Microsoft Teams. This is where you define your event details such as the title of your live event, the time and date, and your **Producers** and **Presenters**. 

 

You define the roles for your event in the **Invite people to your event group** area. There’s usually one producer, but you can have multiple backups of the primary. The producer can:
- Configure the encoder connection  
- Start and stop the live event
- Moderate a Q&A panel

The presenter shows the audio, video, or a screen to the live event or moderates Q&A. There are usually multiple presenters, with different responsibilities. For example, you might have a presenter responsible for only moderating the Q&A. **When you use the external encoder option, presenters invited here are only able to moderate the Q&A (if enabled)**

**Note**: We haven’t defined who’ll be viewing the live event as an attendee; we’ve simply defined who’ll be producing and presenting in your live event.
## Live Event Permissions
Next choose who can attend your event based on the following permission types:  

- **People and groups** – The event can only be watched by the specific people, security groups or Microsoft 365 groups you name. 

- **Org-wide** – Everyone in your org can watch the event, including guests. 

- **Public** – Anyone can join – both people in your org and those outside of it.  
Note – this option is currently unavailable when producing the event using “An external app or device”. 

Before you select **Schedule**, scroll down to view additional options about how you’ll produce your live event.

If your public event supports anonymous attendees, and you choose **Recording available to attendees**, attendees will be able to view (but not download) the recording on-demand using the original event link.
## How will you produce your live event?
What you choose for how your live event will be produced depends on your organization’s goal and preferences. There are several available options:
