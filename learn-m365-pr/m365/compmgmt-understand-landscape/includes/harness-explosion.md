Technology is profoundly impacting our lives; from the way we connect with each other to how we interpret our world. In the past, organizations primarily dealt with the proliferation of documents and emails. Now they are also dealing with an increasing volume of instant messages and chats, videos, images, and more. The result is an exponential growth in the amount of data IT must contend with.

Managing this data overload and the variety of devices on which it is created can be complicated, especially when it comes to ensuring compliance. There are many solution categories and vendors whose solutions fall within some aspect of compliance management. Many have overlapping functionality, which leads to a fragmented approach to resolving the problem.   Many organizations struggle to decide what they need and where to start as result.
