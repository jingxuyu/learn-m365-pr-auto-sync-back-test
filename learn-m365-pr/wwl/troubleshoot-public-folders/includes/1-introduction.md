Once public folders are enabled for an Exchange organization, users can begin to create public folders on demand. As a messaging administrator, you must be aware of potential issues that typically arise with public folders, and you must be ready to handle them. This module examines how to monitor and troubleshoot public folder-related issues.

Because public folders must be monitored using PowerShell, this module identifies the cmdlets provided by Exchange that can be used to monitor public folders. The module then identifies some of the key issues that may occur with public folders and how to troubleshoot them.

The module concludes by examining how to troubleshoot public folder access issues. You'll explore several logs that can be beneficial in this troubleshooting effort, and how to identify the public folder mailbox the client is connecting to.
