After you search the audit log and download the search results to a CSV file, the file contains a column named **AuditData**. This column contains additional information about each event. The data in this column is formatted as a JSON object, which contains multiple properties that are configured as **property:value** pairs separated by commas.

**Question:** If multiple properties are combined together in the **AuditData** column, how can an organization sort and filter on a specific property?

**Answer:** Through the JSON transform feature in the Power Query Editor in Excel. This feature enables an organization to split each property in the JSON object in the **AuditData** column into multiple columns. By doing so, each property will have its own column. In turn, an organization can sort and filter on one or more of these properties. This process can help it quickly locate the specific auditing data that it's looking for.

### Step 1: Export audit log search results

The first step is to search the audit log and then export the results in a comma-separated value (CSV) file to your local computer.

1.  Run an audit log search.
2.  If necessary, revise the search criteria until you have the desired results.
3.  On the search results page, select **Export**, and then select **Download all results**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/exportauditsearchresults-8703ffec.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Audit search window with the Download all results option highlighted.":::
    
    
    This option exports all the audit records from the audit log search. It then adds the raw data from the audit log to a CSV file. It takes a while to prepare the download file for a large search. Large files will result when searching for all activities or using a wide date range.
4.  After the export process is complete, a message is displayed at the top of the window that prompts you to open the CSV file and save it to your local computer. You can also access the CSV file in the **Downloads** folder.
    
    > [!CAUTION]
    > You can download a maximum of 50,000 entries to a CSV file from a single audit log search. If 50,000 entries are downloaded to the CSV file, you can probably assume there are more than 50,000 events that met the search criteria. To export more than this limit, try using a narrower date range to reduce the number of audit log records. You may have to run multiple searches with smaller date ranges to export more than 50,000 entries.

### Step 2: Format the exported audit log using the Power Query Editor

The next step is where the JSON transform feature in the Power Query Editor in Excel comes into play. This feature will split each property in the JSON object in the **AuditData** column into its own column. You can then filter columns to view records based on the values of specific properties. By doing so, you can quickly locate the specific auditing data you're looking for.

1.  Open a blank workbook in Excel for Office 365, Excel 2019, or Excel 2016.
2.  On the **Data** tab, in the **Get &amp; Transform Data** ribbon group, select **From Text/CSV**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/jsontransformopencsvfile-90f3bfaa.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Excel spreadsheet showing the Get and transform data section in the ribbon and the From text and C S V option highlighted.":::
    
3.  Open the CSV file that you downloaded in Step 1.
4.  In the window that's displayed, select **Transform Data**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/jsonopenpowerquery-ee01e9d4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a downloaded C S V file that shows the Transform Data button highlighted.":::
    
    
    The CSV file is opened in the Query Editor. There are four columns: **CreationDate**, **UserIds**, **Operations**, and **AuditData**.
    
    The **AuditData** column is a JSON object that contains multiple properties. The next step is to create a column for each property in the JSON object.
5.  Right-click the title in the **AuditData** column, select **Transform**, and then select **JSON**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/jsontransform-dec1abdb.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a C S V file opened in the Query Editor and showing the Audit Data column and the Transform option highlighted.":::
    
6.  In the upper-right corner of the **AuditData** column, select the expand icon.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/jsontransformexpandicon-14256a23.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a C S V file opened in the Query Editor and showing the Audit Data column and the Expand icon highlighted.":::
    
    
    A partial list of the properties in the JSON objects in the **AuditData** column is displayed.
7.  Select **Load more** to display all properties in the JSON objects in the **AuditData** column.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/jsontransformloadjsonproperties-460e3f6f.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a C S V file opened in the Query Editor and showing the Audit Data column and the Load more option highlighted.":::
    
    
    You can unselect the checkbox next to any property that you don't want to include. Eliminating columns that aren't useful for your investigation is a good way to reduce the amount of data displayed in the audit log.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The JSON properties displayed in the previous screenshot (after you select **Load more**) are based on the properties found in the **AuditData** column from the first 1,000 rows in the CSV file. If there are different JSON properties in records after the first 1,000 rows, these properties (and a corresponding column) won't be included when the **AuditData** column is split into multiple columns. To help prevent this situation, consider rerunning the audit log search. But this time, narrow the search criteria so that fewer records are returned. Another workaround is to filter items in the **Operations** column to reduce the number of rows (before you perform step 5 above) before transforming the JSON object in the **AuditData** column.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > To view an attribute within a list such as AuditData.AffectedItems, select the **Expand** icon in the upper right corner of the column you want to pull an attribute from. Then select **Expand to New Row**. From there it will be a record and you can select the **Expand** icon in the upper right corner of the column, view the attributes, and select the one you want to view or extract.
8.  Complete either of the following options to format the title of the columns that are added for each JSON property that's selected:
     -  Unselect the **Use original column name as prefix** check box. By doing so, the name of the JSON properties will be used as the column names. For example, **RecordType** or **SourceFileName**.
     -  Leave the **Use original column name as prefix** check box selected. By doing so, the AuditData prefix will be added to the column names. For example, **AuditData.RecordType** or **AuditData.SourceFileName**.
9.  Select **OK**.
    
    The **AuditData** column will now be split into multiple columns. Each new column corresponds to a property in the AuditData JSON object. Each row in the column contains the value for the property. If the property doesn't contain a value, the *null* value is displayed. In Excel, cells with null values are empty.
10. On the **Home** tab, select **Close &amp; Load** to close the Power Query Editor and open the transformed CSV file in an Excel workbook.

### Use PowerShell to search and export audit log records

Instead of using the audit log search tool in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you can use the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to export the results of an audit log search to a CSV file. Then you can follow the same procedure described in Step 2 to format the audit log using the Power Query editor.

One advantage of using the PowerShell cmdlet is that you can search for events from a specific service by using the **RecordType** parameter. This section displays a few examples of using PowerShell to export audit records to a CSV file so you can use the Power Query editor to transform the JSON object in the AuditData column as described in Step 2.

In this example, run the following commands to return all records related to SharePoint sharing operations.

```powershell
$auditlog = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 06/01/2019 -EndDate 06/30/2019 -RecordType SharePointSharingOperation

$auditlog | Select-Object -Property CreationDate,UserIds,RecordType,AuditData | Export-Csv -Path c:\AuditLogs\PowerShellAuditlog.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

The search results are exported to a CSV file named **PowerShellAuditlog** that contains four columns: **CreationDate**, **UserIds**, **RecordType**, **AuditData**.<br>

You can also use the name or enum value for the record type as the value for the **RecordType** parameter. For a list of record type names and their corresponding enum values, see the **AuditLogRecordType** table in [Office 365 Management Activity API schema](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#enum-auditlogrecordtype---type-edmint32?azure-portal=true).

You can only include a single value for the **RecordType** parameter. To search for audit records for other record types, you must run the two previous commands again to specify a different record type and append those results to the original CSV file. For example, you would run the following two commands to add SharePoint file activities from the same date range to the PowerShellAuditlog.csv file.

```powershell
$auditlog = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 06/01/2019 -EndDate 06/30/2019 -RecordType SharePointFileOperation

$auditlog | Select-Object -Property CreationDate,UserIds,RecordType,AuditData | Export-Csv -Append -Path c:\AuditLogs\PowerShellAuditlog.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

### Tips for exporting and viewing the audit log

Here are some tips and examples of exporting and viewing the audit log before and after you use the JSON transform feature to split the AuditData column into multiple columns.

 -  Filter the **RecordType** column to display only the records from a specific service or functional area. For example, to show events related to SharePoint sharing, you would select 14 (the enum value for records triggered by SharePoint sharing activities). For a list of the services that correspond to the enum values displayed in the **RecordType** column, see [Detailed properties in the audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/detailed-properties-in-the-office-365-audit-log?azure-portal=true).
 -  Filter the **Operations** column to display the records for specific activities. For a list of most operations that correspond to a searchable activity in the audit log search tool in the compliance portal, see the "Audited activities" section in [Search the audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?azure-portal=true).
