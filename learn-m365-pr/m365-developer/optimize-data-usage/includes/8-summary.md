In this module, you learned how you can use query parameters to control the requests you make to Microsoft Graph endpoints. You saw how to use various query parameters to manipulate queries to Microsoft Graph using both the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK and Graph Explorer web tool to execute REST queries.

Using these tools that you learned about, you can optimize the usage of Microsoft Graph in your applications by controlling the amount of data returned, searching and limiting request round trips through batching.
