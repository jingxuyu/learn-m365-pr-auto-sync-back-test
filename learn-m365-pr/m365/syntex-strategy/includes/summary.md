At Contoso Electronics, you recognized a need to organize document libraries and to improve content processes for the Sales team. You developed a proposal for using SharePoint Syntex to streamline processes and help make the case for leadership buy-in. You began by understanding how form processing and document understanding models could work for different types of documents within the Sales organization.

You identified the necessary SharePoint Syntex roles such as knowledge admin, Power Platform admin, knowledge manager, and model owner. With the roles identified, you then shopped your presentation to the stakeholders within your organization. By putting together a thoughtful SharePoint Syntex strategy for one business unit, you supported the business case for the adoption of SharePoint Syntex throughout the organization.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Determine team members for operating different components of SharePoint Syntex
- Pinpoint key stakeholders for involvement when enabling SharePoint Syntex
- Create alignment on your organization's specific strategy for SharePoint Syntex
