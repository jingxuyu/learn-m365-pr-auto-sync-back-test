Windows Security Center is a component of Windows 10 and later that covers all aspects of security for the operating system, accounts and applications being used on a specific device. Windows Security Center, evolved from previous versions of Microsoft Defender anti-malware software, delivers a robust suite of security features that help keep you safe for the supported lifetime of your Windows device.

Windows Security Center is turned on, by default and it works from the moment you install Windows operating system. It covers the following areas:

 -  **Virus and threat protection** help handle all anti-virus and anti-malware tasks.
 -  **Account protection** allows you to configure account sign-in options, as well as Windows Hello sign-in options and Dynamic lock settings.
 -  **Firewall and network protection.** You can manage Windows Firewall, configure applications that must communicate through firewall and also setup domain profiles for firewall.
 -  **App and browser control.** In this part of Windows Security Center, you can configure the Microsoft Defender SmartScreen feature that helps you protect a device by proactively checking for unrecognized apps and files from the internet. The SmartScreen feature also works for Microsoft Edge as well as for Microsoft store apps.
 -  **Device security.** You can find information about processor core isolation, processor security, TPM and secure boot features.
 -  **Device performance &amp; health.** You can check if Windows is up-to-date and check for other issues that can impact general device health. You can check for storage capacity problems, device drives issues, battery life issues and apps and software issues. From here you can also initiate a fresh start for an installed copy of Windows.
 -  **Family options.** You can review and configure available options for family safety and parental controls.
 -  **Protection History (Windows 11).** List recent threats and any recommended actions. This option is located under Virus and threat protection in Windows 10.
