When configuring options in Windows for an organization, the ability to configure options at scale becomes a necessity. The most common methods of configuring devices at scale are applying settings using a centralized management console or scripting.

Group Policy allows an administrator to create configuration policies that can be applied to a group of devices using a management console. Windows PowerShell is a powerful tool that you can use to configure a Windows device using a command-line interface and create reusable scripts.
