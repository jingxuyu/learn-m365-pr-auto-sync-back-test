There are many resources available to OKR Champions and having a sense of what these are and when to deploy them creates a stronger program. 

Generally, resources fall into three buckets: pre-program kickoff, the OKR cycle, and future state.

## Pre-program kickoff

Before you kick off your OKR program with Viva Goals, be sure to read our [Viva Goals Adoption Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193441). This guide provides guidance on how to roll out a pilot program successfully, including communication templates.

## The OKR cycle

**At the beginning of the OKR program** once users have their accounts set up, Champions should direct their teams to the [Get Started with Viva Goals](/paths/viva-goals-get-started) learning path. This course introduces OKRs as a goal-setting framework, shows how to write great OKRs, and provides software basics for using the platform. 

OKR Champions can also send out the [OKR Writing Cheat Sheet Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2194114) to help users get a strong sense for how to write effective OKRs. 

**Midway through the OKR cycle**, OKR Champions should reinforce guidance about check-ins to their teams to ensure that everyone understands the process and is regularly checking in to their OKRs.

As users approach **the end of the first OKR cycle**, OKR Champions should provide guidance and further direction on this process. OKR Champions can refer users to [Scoring and Closing OKRs](https://help.ally.io/articles/1796003-scoring-and-closing-okrs) as a reference for beginning this process.

## Future state

As organizations move through several OKR cycles, OKR Champions can help them continue to grow by communicating where improvement is possible and examples of what this might look like. [The OKR Maturity Model](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2193442) helps companies identify their level of OKR maturity and what to strive for in the future.
