Similar to locally deployed AD DS, you manage Azure AD objects and settings, but by using a different set of tools. When using Azure AD, you will need to create users, groups, and devices. Also, you can use role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure to configure and delegate permissions. Unlike AD DS, you can manage multiple Azure AD tenants by using an account from a single tenant. In this lesson, you will learn how to manage Azure AD.

After this module, you should be able to:

 -  Describe RBAC and user roles in Azure AD.
 -  Create and manage users in Azure AD.
 -  Create and manage groups in Azure AD.
 -  Use Windows PowerShell cmdlets to manage Azure AD.
 -  Describe how you can synchronize objects from AD DS to Azure AD.
