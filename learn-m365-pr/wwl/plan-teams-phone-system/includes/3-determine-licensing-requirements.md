Microsoft Teams Phone system is configured as an additional add-on License.  Ultimately, the add-on’s give you the flexibility to add features only for users in your organization who need them. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.
## What features can I get with add-on licenses?

Here's a list of features that you can add with Teams add-on licenses. The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan you have.

### Small Business

If you're a small or medium-sized business (fewer than 300 users), you have four ways to get voice features:

- Buy a **Microsoft 365 Business** plan and **Microsoft 365 Business Voice**.

- Buy a **Microsoft 365 Enterprise E1 or E3** plan and **Microsoft 365 Business Voice**.

- Buy a **Microsoft 365 Enterprise E1 or E3** plan and add voice features individually.

- Buy a **Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5** plan, which includes voice features.

For Microsoft 365 Business Voice, you have two options to choose from:

- **Microsoft 365 Business Voice with a Calling Plan**: Get this if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by Microsoft.

- **Microsoft 365 Business Voice without a Calling Plan (Direct Routing)**: Get this if you want all phone number management and billing to be handled by your third-party telephone provider. You'll need to set up and deploy Direct Routing to connect your on-premises Session Border Controllers (SBCs) to Microsoft 365 or Office 365.
