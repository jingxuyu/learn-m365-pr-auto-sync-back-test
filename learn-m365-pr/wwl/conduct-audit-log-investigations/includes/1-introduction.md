Audit logging for all workloads across Microsoft 365 can be enabled by turning on this feature in the Microsoft 365 compliance Center. When audit log search is turned on, user and administrator activity from your organization is recorded in the unified audit log and kept for 90 days.

In this module, you'll examine the steps for searching, viewing, filtering, and exporting the audit log by using the Microsoft 365 compliance center. You'll also review the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** PowerShell cmdlet. This cmdlet enables you to search for events from:

 -  Exchange Online
 -  SharePoint Online
 -  OneDrive for Business
 -  Azure Active Directory
 -  other Microsoft 365 services

After completing this module, you'll be able to: 

 -  Describe what the audit log is and the permissions that are necessary to search the Microsoft 365 audit log.
 -  Create audit policies in SharePoint Online.
 -  Enter criteria for searching the audit log.
 -  View, sort, and filter search results.
 -  Export search results to a CSV file.
