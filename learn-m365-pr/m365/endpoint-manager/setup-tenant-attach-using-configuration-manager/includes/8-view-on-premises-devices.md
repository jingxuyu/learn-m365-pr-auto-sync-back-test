2. Click **Devices** > **All Devices**.
3. Select a device that is synced from Configuration Manager via tenant attach.<br>
   You can recognize devices that have been synced via tenant attach because **ConfigMgr** will be listed in the **Managed by** column for the device. Devices can also be listed as **Co-managed** when both Configuration Manager and Intune apply, or as **Intune** when only Intune management applies.
4. Click **Resource explorer** to view hardware inventory.
5. Search for or select a class (a device value) to retrieve information from the client.

   [ ![Resource explorer in Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](../media/set-up-tenant-attach-using-confirmation-manager-05.png) ](../media/set-up-tenant-attach-using-confirmation-manager-05.png#lightbox)

Resource explorer can display a historical view of the device inventory in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. When troubleshooting, having historical inventory data can provide valuable information about changes to the device.

1. From the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, select **Resource explorer** if you don't have it selected already.
2. Select a class (a device value).
3. Enter a custom date in the date time picker to get historical inventory data.

For more information about viewing device data for tenant attach devices, see [Tenant attach: Resource explorer in the admin center](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/resource-explorer).

## App management

From the Microsoft Endpoint Management admin center, you can initiate an application install in real time for a tenant attached device. You can deploy an application to a device or user. Also, you can repair, re-evaluate, reinstall, or uninstall an application.

Use the following steps to install an application to an on-premises device:

1. In a browser, navigate to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Devices** > **All Devices**.
3. Select a device that is synced from Configuration Manager via tenant attach.<br>
   As noted before, you can recognize devices that have been synced via tenant attach because **ConfigMgr** will be listed in the **Managed by** column for the device. Devices can also be listed as **Co-managed** when both Configuration Manager and Intune apply, or as **Intune** when only Intune management applies.
4. Click **Applications** to view a list of applicable apps.
5. Select an application that hasn't been installed and click **Install**.

   [ ![Screenshot of application installation from Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](../media/set-up-tenant-attach-using-confirmation-manager-11.png) ](../media/set-up-tenant-attach-using-confirmation-manager-11.png#lightbox)

For more information about applications and tenant attach, see [Tenant attach: Install an application from the admin center](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/applications).

## Scripts

You can run PowerShell scripts from the cloud against an individual Configuration Manager managed device in real time. You can also allow additional personas, like Helpdesk, to run PowerShell scripts. This gives all the traditional benefits of PowerShell scripts that have already been defined and approved by the Configuration Manager admin to this new environment.

1. In a browser, navigate to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).
2. Click **Devices** > **All Devices**.
3. Select a device that is synced from Configuration Manager via tenant attach.<br>
   As noted before, you can recognize devices that have been synced via tenant attach because **ConfigMgr** will be listed in the **Managed by** column for the device. Devices can also be listed as **Co-managed** when both Configuration Manager and Intune apply, or as **Intune** when only Intune management applies.
4. Click **Scripts** to view a list of available scripts.

   Scripts that were recently run that directly targeted the device will already be listed. The list includes scripts run from the admin center, SDK, or the Configuration Manager console. Scripts initiated from the Configuration Manager console against collections containing the device won't be shown, unless the scripts were also initiated specifically for the single device.

   [ ![Screenshot of the scripts list from Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](../media/set-up-tenant-attach-using-confirmation-manager-12.png) ](../media/set-up-tenant-attach-using-confirmation-manager-12.png#lightbox)

For more information about running scripts on tenant attached devices, see [Tenant attach: Run Scripts from the admin center](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/scripts).

## Device event timeline

When Configuration Manager synchronizes a device to Microsoft Endpoint Manager through tenant attach, you can see a timeline of events. This timeline shows past activity on the device that can help you troubleshoot problems.

Once a day Configuration Manager sends the on-premises device events to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center. Only events collected after the client receives the **Enable Endpoint analytics data collection** policy are visible in the admin center. You can generate test events easily by installing an application or an update from Configuration Manager, or restart the device. Events are kept for 30 days.

> [!NOTE]
> As a [prerequisite](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/timeline#prerequisites) to view the timeline from the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, you must set **Enable Endpoint analytics data collection** to **Yes** in Configuration Manager. For more information about implementing the device timeline, see [Tenant attach: Device timeline in the admin center](/mem/configmgr/tenant-attach/timeline).

To view the device event timeline:

1. In a browser, navigate to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).
2. Click  **Devices** > **All Devices**.
3. Select a device that is synced from Configuration Manager via tenant attach.<br>
   As noted before, you can recognize devices that have been synced via tenant attach because **ConfigMgr** will be listed in the **Managed by** column for the device. Devices can also be listed as **Co-managed** when both Configuration Manager and Intune apply, or as **Intune** when only Intune management applies.
4. Click **Timeline**. By default, you're shown events from the last 24 hours.
   - Select **Sync** to fetch the recent data generated on client. The device sends events once a day to the admin center by default.
   - Use the **Filter** button to change the **Time range**, **Event levels**, and **Provider name**.
   - If you select an event, you'll see the detailed message for it.
   - Select **Refresh** to reload the page and to see newly collected events.
