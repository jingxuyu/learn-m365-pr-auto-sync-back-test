This module is designed to help you plan for Microsoft Search and will outline the initial steps needed to begin implementation. We'll guide you through the assignment and management of key roles, introduce the metrics you can use to measure and track usage and engagement, and share methods to increase adoption of Microsoft Search in your organization. 

**Scenario:** An IT admin has zeroed in on Microsoft Search as a solution to their organization’s search needs. Management is pleased with the idea and has given the admin permission to assign a Search admin to help with rollout and content planning. Both admins now need to identify the types of metrics available with Microsoft Search and engage with other stakeholders. Together, they will determine their roles and responsibilities and begin defining the content that’s needed for deployment.
