  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Tailspin Toys, Alan Deyoung is planning to run a staged migration to move the company's user mailboxes to Microsoft 365. Alan must determine when to change the company's MX record to point to Exchange Online. At which point should Alan change the company's MX record?"
    choices:
    - content: "Before the final synchronization run"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. When running a cutover migration, you must change the DNS MX record before your final synchronization run."
    - content: "After all migration batches are complete"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. In a Staged migration, your DNS MX record must point to the on-premises environment for the entirety of the migration because Azure AD Connect synchronizes your Active Directory to Microsoft 365. As such, you should not change the DNS MX record to point to Microsoft 365 until after all your migration batches are complete."
    - content: "Tailspin doesn't need to change the MX record"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Organizations must switch their MX records to Exchange Online, unless they have a required third-party mail-archiving system on-premises."
  - content: "Northwind Traders has an Exchange 2007 deployment with over 2,500 users. It's currently planning to migrate its user's mailboxes to Exchange Online. Which migration option should Northwind use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cutover migration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. A cutover migration is only recommended when an organization has Exchange 2007 or later and has fewer than 2,000 users."
    - content: "Full hybrid configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. A full hybrid configuration migration requires Exchange 2010 or later."
    - content: "Staged migration"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Both staged and cutover migrations can be used with Exchange 2007 deployments. However, cutover migrations are recommended for organizations with fewer than 2,000 users, while staged migrations are recommended for organizations with more than 2,000 users."
  - content: "Lucerne Publishing has an Exchange 2016 deployment but doesn't want long-term coexistence. Lucerne has less than 1,000 mailboxes to migrate to Microsoft 365. Which of the following migration options should it consider implementing to migrate its user mailboxes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cutover migration"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. If the organization has Exchange but doesn't want long-term coexistence, the deciding factor is the number of users. If there are fewer than 2000 users, the recommended solution is an Exchange cutover migration."
    - content: "Staged migration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This migration option isn't the recommended approach given Lucerne's requirements."
    - content: "Full hybrid configuration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This migration option isn't the recommended approach given Lucerne's requirements."
