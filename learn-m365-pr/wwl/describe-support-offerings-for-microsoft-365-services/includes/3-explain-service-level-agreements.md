It’s vital that organizations know that the products and services they’re using are reliable and secure. Microsoft 365 services guarantees level of service for your organization. Level of service is detailed in a legal agreement referred to as a **Service Level Agreement.** Microsoft details its commitment to provide and maintain agreed service levels for Microsoft 365 services through its **Microsoft Online Services Agreement.** 

In addition to the Microsoft Online Service Level Agreement, your organization can also take advantage of the Service Level Agreement with your Cloud Service Provider. The guarantees of service provided for Microsoft 365 services will vary between cloud service providers.

Microsoft’s Online Service Level Agreement introduces several concepts:

    **Incident**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    A set of events or single event that results in downtime.

    **Uptime**

    The total time your services are functional.

    **Downtime**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    The definition of downtime depends on the relevant service. For example, with Microsoft Teams, any period of time where users are unable to initiate online meetings, see presence statuses, or unable to instant message is considered downtime. Your downtime reduces the total time your services are functional (your uptime).

    **Claim**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    A claim raises information about an incident. Your organization is responsible for submitting a claim on an incident. The organization should provide the details about the experienced downtime, affected users, and how it was attempted to resolve the incident. Microsoft is responsible for processing the claim.

    **Service credit**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    Service credits are submitted by the organization’s admin. If the claim is successfully approved by Microsoft, your organization will receive service credits. The service credit will be the percentage of the total monthly fees your organization paid for the month where you experienced downtime.

    **Service level**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    The performance metric(s) set forth in the SLA that Microsoft agrees to meet in the delivery of the Services.

    **Uptime agreement**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    The uptime agreement is defined by the monthly uptime percentage. This percentage is for a given active tenant in a calendar month and the calculation varies depending on the product or service. For example, the calculation could be as follows: 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠 − 𝐷𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 / 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠 𝑥 100.
  :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::


Microsoft is confident in its commitment to service levels. The percentage of service credit your organization can receive is linked to your monthly uptime percentage. For example, if downtime has resulted in a monthly uptime percentage lower than 95 percent, your organization could receive a 100% percent service credit. The table describes the monthly uptime percentage and corresponding service credit:

Your organization should always review all Service Level Agreements and ask questions, including the following list:

 -  If you're using a Cloud Service Provider, how does it determine service levels and whether they're achieved or not?
 -  Who is responsible for reports? How can your organization access reports?
 -  Are there any exceptions in the agreement?
 -  What does the agreement say about both unexpected and scheduled maintenance?
 -  What does the agreement say about what happens if your infrastructure goes down because of an attack? What about natural disasters and other situations outside of your control?
 -  Does the agreement cover non-Microsoft service or system failures?
 -  What are the limits to the cloud service provider’s liability in the agreement?
