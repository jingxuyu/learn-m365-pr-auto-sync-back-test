    - content: "An application installed on the recipient's device"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "An application or service that sends HTML-formatted email with Adaptive Card markup"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Actionable Messages in Outlook are transmitted and delivered over SMTP as HTML-formatted email with Adaptive Card markup."
  - content: "Which of the following action types can be auto-invoked when the user opens the message, allowing the card to update with fresh data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Action.Http"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "An Action.Http action can be configured to execute when the user opens the message, calling your web API to get an updated message card."
    - content: "Action.InvokeAddInCommand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Action.InvokeAddInCommand action opens an Outlook add-in and does not update the message card. It cannot be auto-invoked."
    - content: "Action.OpenUrl"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The Action.OpenUrl action is part of the standard Adaptive Card schema. It opens a browser to a specified URL. It cannot be auto-invoked."
  - content: "What method does a web API use to ensure that a request is valid?"
    choices:
    - content: "Verifying the calling server's IP address with a list of accepted IP addresses"

      explanation: "Microsoft does not publish a list of IP addresses that execute Actionable Message actions."
    - content: "Validating the bearer token"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Validating the bearer token ensure that the request originated from Microsoft 365, and allows you to determine the identity of the user that took the action."
    - content: "Including a secret value in the body of the HTTP POST"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Including a secret value in the Adaptive Card JSON that is replayed to your service can reduce the likelihood of processing an invalid request, but not eliminate it."
