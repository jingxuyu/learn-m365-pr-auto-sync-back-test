This module explored the use of organizational sharing. In an Exchange organization, users often share information such as their calendar free/busy information (known as calendar availability) and detailed calendar information. Similar sharing functionality can be provided when two or more organizations that work closely together use Exchange server or Exchange Online as their messaging system. This functionality to share information between Exchange organizations is known as federation or federated sharing.

Federated sharing enables users in one organization to request the free/busy calendar information of users in the other organization. They can also configure policies to allow read-only calendar sharing.

This module began by examining federation delegation. This feature enables users from one federated organization to be trusted by another federated organization. With those trust relationships established, users within each organization can begin sharing information.

To support federated sharing, you learned about federated sharing components. You also reviewed considerations for designing and implementing federated sharing.

The module concluded by examining how to implement the organization relationships and sharing policies that are needed to begin sharing information across trusted organizations.
