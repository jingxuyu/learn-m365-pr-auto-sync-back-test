Your organization required a current, secure, highly scalable Azure Virtual Desktop solution that would support its employees who work remotely and protect them from planned and unplanned failures.

Disaster planning and recovery is a critical element of IT operations, regardless of whether an organization's systems are located on-premises, in the cloud, or a combination of both. Public cloud platforms offer services for backing up critical data, restoring it when lost, failing over to secondary systems when primary systems go down, and mitigating (and recovering from) the effects of failures.

In this module, you learned how to implement protection of your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. You also learned how to protect your company from different failure scenarios and ensure business continuity.
