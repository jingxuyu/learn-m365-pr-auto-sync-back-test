The Windows 10 upgrade process is designed with reliability in mind. When something unexpected happens during the upgrade - for example, the device loses power or there's not enough free space available on the device - the upgrade process notifies you about the problem. The upgrade process stores a copy of all the files that it wants to modify or replace in the **Windows.old** folder. If needed, it can recover the device to the pre-upgrade state.

If an error occurs during a Windows 10 upgrade, you can contact Microsoft Support. But before doing that, you should carefully review the error message and determine whether you can resolve the issue yourself. Each error message includes a description, which can be helpful when troubleshooting the issue. The following screenshot is an example of a Windows 10 upgrade error that occurred when the device didn't have sufficient RAM.

If an error happens during the upgrade, you should determine if one of the following common mitigation steps would resolve it:

 -  Remove nonessential external hardware, such as docks and USB devices.
 -  Check the system drive for errors and attempt repairs.
 -  Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter.
 -  Attempt to restore and repair system files.
 -  Update Windows so that all available recommended updates are installed. Ensure the computer is restarted if necessary to complete installation of an update.
 -  Temporarily uninstall non-Microsoft antivirus software.
 -  Uninstall all non-essential software.
 -  Update firmware and drivers.
 -  Ensure that the "Download and install updates (recommended)" option is selected at the start of the upgrade process.
 -  Verify that at least 16 GB of free space is available to upgrade to a 32-bit Windows 10, or 20 GB to upgrade to 64-bit Windows 10.
