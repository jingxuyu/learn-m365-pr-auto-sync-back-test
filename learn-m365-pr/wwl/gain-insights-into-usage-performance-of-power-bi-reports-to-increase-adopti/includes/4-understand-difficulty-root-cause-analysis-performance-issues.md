- Limited logs and metrics available in the service.

- No long-term storage of performance, health, or usage metrics.

- Difficult to access relevant data.

- Too many information sources and tools to get a full picture, making correlation difficult or impossible.

- Performance tuning is difficult and time-consuming.
