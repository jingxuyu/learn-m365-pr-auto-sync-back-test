Microsoft Search is available as part of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription. While no setup is required, you can improve the overall experience with some basic administration or editing tasks.

The Search & intelligence settings is where you’ll spend most of your time administering and creating custom content. It’s important to remember that only Search admins or Search editors can access these tools and settings.

Here’s how to get to them:

1. In your browser, go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
2. If the left navigation menu is collapsed, select **Show all**.
3. Select **Settings**, then **Search & intelligence**.

We’ll cover other settings and tasks, like managing roles and understanding search metrics in Module 2.
