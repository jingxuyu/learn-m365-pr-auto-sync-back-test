Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate administrators to manage your organization's Microsoft Teams deployment. Administrators can manage the entire Teams workload, or they can have delegated permissions for specific tasks such as troubleshooting call quality. Teams administrators can also customize and configure Teams default settings based on their organization's profile and business requirements. For example, you can set policies to control what apps are available org-wide or to specific Teams users and you can customize Teams by pinning the apps that are most important for your users.

In this module, you'll learn about creating an organization-wide team, designating team roles, and how to manage membership, access, and messaging policies for your Team members.
