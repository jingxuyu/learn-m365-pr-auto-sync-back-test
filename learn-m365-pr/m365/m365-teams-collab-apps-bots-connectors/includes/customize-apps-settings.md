Teams can provide a great collaboration experience for your organization without any initial customization, and most find that the default settings for apps work for them. Still, you may want to change some of those default settings to accommodate any business requirements:

- **Apps availability**. Teams provides apps published by Microsoft and by third parties. These apps engage users, support productivity, and integrate commonly used business services. You get apps from the Teams Store. By default all apps, including custom apps, are turned on for all users. You can turn any apps on or off for your entire organization.
- **Apps permissions**. Apps are consented to by users and managed by the admin or IT pro through policies. However, for the most part, an app's permissions and risk profile are defined in the app itself.
- **App templates**. These production-ready apps for Microsoft Teams are community driven, open-source, and available on GitHub. Each contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing it.
 
You can use activity reports to see how users in your organization are using Teams. If some donâ€™t use Teams yet, they might not know how to get started or understand how they can use it.
