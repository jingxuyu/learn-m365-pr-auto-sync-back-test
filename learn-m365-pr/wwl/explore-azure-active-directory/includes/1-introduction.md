With more services available online and in the cloud, organizations are finding that they also need to define and manage cloud identities. As with on-premises identities, you can use cloud identities to authenticate and authorize users when they try to access resources. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based service, where the primary purpose is to provide identity management, authentication, and access-control capabilities for other cloud-based applications.

After this module, you should be able to:

 -  Describe Azure AD.
 -  Compare Azure AD to Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
 -  Describe how Azure AD is used as a directory for cloud apps.
 -  Describe Azure AD Premium P1 and P2.
