You use Microsoft Endpoint Manager to configure and manage Surface devices, including Surface Hub. Each Surface Hub device has built-in components that integrate with Microsoft Endpoint Manager to allow IT administrators to manage policies and settings.

In this unit, you'll see how to create a device restriction profile using Microsoft Endpoint Manager and check the settings on a Surface Hub.

## Create a device restriction profile using Microsoft Endpoint Manager

If you are using your Surface Hub in a kiosk or public setting, you will want to limit what it is able to do. You can use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center to create a configuration policy, which is then applied. This policy can be created quickly using only a few steps:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center using your administrator credentials.
1. Select **Devices** from the navigation options.
1. From the **Devices | Overview** page, select **Configuration profiles**.
1. From the **Configuration profiles** page, select **+ Create profile**.
1. Under **Platform**, select **Windows 10 and later**.
1. Under **Profile type**, select **Templates**.
1. Select **Device restrictions (Windows 10 Team)**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Add a name, and then select **Next**.
1. You can now browse and choose from preset device restriction settings for Surface Hub across the following categories:
    - Apps and experience
    - Azure operational insights
    - Maintenance
    - Session
    - Wireless projection

## Review and manage settings in the Surface Hub

1. In the **User Account Control** dialog box, enter your administrator credentials and select **Yes**.
1. On the **Windows Settings** page, select **Surface Hub**.
1. In the left navigation, select **Device management**.
1. On the **Device management** page, under **Device management**, select your tenant, and then select **Info**.
1. At the bottom of the page, select **Sync**. You'll need to wait for the synchronization to complete.
1. On the **Settings** page, select the **‚Üê** arrow.
1. In the left navigation, select **Home**.
1. On the **Windows Settings** page, select **Update & Security**.
1. On the **Windows Update** page, select **Advanced options**.
1. On the **Advanced options** page, under **Maintenance hours**, verify that the **Start time** and **Duration** match the policy setting.
1. At the bottom of the screen, select **End session**, and then select **Yes**.
