    - content: "Data immunization helps apply security controls to documents based on their classification at the moment of creation. Which of the following is a primary benefit of data immunization?"
      choices:
      - content: "Automated reporting and analytics"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Although you can get automated reporting and analytics when data is classified, it is not a primary benefit of immunization."
      - content: "Minimize the exposure time of the data"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. By using data immunization, you limit the amount of exposure time that the data is unclassified or unprotected."
      - content: "Automated data scan and crawl"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can use Azure Information Protection Scanner to identify unlabeled or inappropriately labeled documents, but it is not a direct benefit of data immunization."
      - content: "Data cannot be stored on the dark web"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Data immunization helps control data leakage by immediate classification, but it cannot prevent compromised data from being stored on the dark web."

    - content: "One of the first steps to prevent data loss involves identifying data that needs protection. What Microsoft tool helps administrators detect and classify documents automatically?"
      choices:
      - content: "Data Loss Prevention"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Data Loss Prevention helps keep data protected and secured but will not scan through file storage to detect and classify documents."
      - content: "Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "MCAS is a cloud broker solution to help extend your security to third-party apps and services"
      - content: "SharePoint File Scanner"
        isCorrect: false

    - content: "A security administrator needs to ensure any Excel files shared through a financial line-of-business cloud app are controlled and not shared externally. What information protection action should the security administrator take?"
      choices:
      - content: "Create an Azure Information Protection rule to classify all documents as confidential."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This would over-classify all documents and require end users to de-classify documents that they do not consider confidential."
      - content: "Use Azure Information Protection Scanner"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Azure Information Protection Scanner crawls through storage to identify documents containing possible sensitive information and classify them accordingly."
      - content: "Configure a Cloud App Security (CAS) DLP rule"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The security administrator could create a CAS DLP rule that detects and reclassifies Excel files that have been shared to OneDrive or SharePoint Online."
      - content: "Create an Exchange transport rule"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "An Exchange transport rule with DLP would search for sensitive information contained in email and classify the message accordingly."
