  - content: "Fabrikam wants to configure the Autodiscover service to aid its users when they enroll their Windows 10 devices to its MDM authority. What does Fabrikam need to do to configure the Autodiscover service for device enrollment to its MDM authority?"
    choices:
    - content: "Purchase an Azure AD Premium license"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action doesn't configure the Autodiscover service for device enrollment. Try again."
    - content: "Add an EnterpriseRegistration CNAME DNS record that points to EnterpriseRegistration.windows.net"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action is required when organizations want to enable the Autodiscover service for registering devices in Azure AD rather than MDM. Try again."
    - content: "Create a CNAME record in the external (public) DNS zone that automatically redirects enrollment requests to Intune servers"
      isCorrect: true

  - content: "Contoso wants to use Conditional Access with Microsoft Intune to keep its corporate data secure, while giving users an experience that enables them to do their best work from any device, and from any location. What must Contoso do to enable Conditional Access?"
    choices:
    - content: "Purchase an Azure AD Premium license"
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "Enable it through the Company Portal app"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't how you enable Conditional Access. Try again."

    choices:
    - content: "Device compliance policy"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Security policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Organizations can use security policies to enforce users to enroll their devices to MDM. Try again."
    - content: "Conditional Access policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Organizations use Conditional Access policies with Microsoft Intune to control the devices and apps that can connect to an organization's email and company resources. When integrated, you can control access to keep your corporate data secure, while giving users an experience that enables them to do their best work from any device, and from any location."
