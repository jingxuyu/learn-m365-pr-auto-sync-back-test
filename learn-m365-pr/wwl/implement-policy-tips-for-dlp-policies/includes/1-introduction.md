When implementing Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies, organizations must educate users who work with sensitive information as to why some content is protected. And while organizations want them to stay compliant with their policies, they donâ€™t want to unnecessarily block them from getting their work done. It's in these types of situations where policy tips can help.

This module examines the end-user experience when people work with content that contains sensitive information. You'll learn how to configure policy tips, along with how they're displayed. The module also examines how to implement policy tips in the following sources:

 -  Email messages in Outlook
 -  SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive for Business accounts
 -  Microsoft Office documents

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the user experience when a user creates an email that contains sensitive information.
 -  Describe the user experience when a user shares content on a SharePoint or OneDrive for Business site that contains sensitive information.
 -  Explain the behavior of Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations when a user enters sensitive information.
