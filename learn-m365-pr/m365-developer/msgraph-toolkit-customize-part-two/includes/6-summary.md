The Microsoft Graph Toolkit components provide a pre-built UI that looks and feels like other Microsoft 365 experiences. These web components can be used out the box with the provided design directly in your app. 

If you want to match your branding with the components and change the way they look or the type of data shown, you can customize the components by using attributes, CSS custom properties, and templating.
