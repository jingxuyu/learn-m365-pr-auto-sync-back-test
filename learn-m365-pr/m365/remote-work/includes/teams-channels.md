In Microsoft Teams, teams are groups of people, content, and tools brought together for work, projects, or common interests. A team is designed to bring together a group of people who work closely to get things done.

Teams are made up ofâ€¯channels. Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, and work on files together. Each channel is built around a specific topic, like "Team Events" or a department name.

The tabs at the top of each channel link to your favorite files, apps, and services. Every channel has three default tabs:

- **Conversation** shows all conversations happening in that channel.
- **Files** shows all the files saved to that channel.
- **Wiki** where you can collaborate in real time.

You can add more tabs to further organize your information.
