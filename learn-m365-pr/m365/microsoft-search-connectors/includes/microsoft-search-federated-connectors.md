Microsoft Search federation uses connectors to make information accessible in Microsoft Search apps and services, including SharePoint, Office.com, and Bing—without including it in your Microsoft 365 index.

It makes data in these scenarios available in your organization's results:

- Data in systems subject to strict compliance requirements.
- Data that can't leave system boundaries.
- Sensitive data stored on-premises that your organization doesn’t want indexed on the cloud.
