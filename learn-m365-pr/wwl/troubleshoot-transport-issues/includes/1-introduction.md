Besides troubleshooting issues with mail flow, Messaging administrators must also be proficient in troubleshooting transport components, such as transport agents, connectors, and general architecture issues.

The transport services on a server are part of the entire mail flow process. Transport is often meant for describing the message delivery processes inside a server, while mail flow is more focused on the delivery between servers and message routing. This module examines the various issues that Messaging administrators must consider to successfully manage the transport services that guide their mail flow.

To aid messaging administrators, this module introduces you to various tools and approaches that are available for managing transport services within on-premises Exchange Server deployments. You'll learn how to modify the default internal message flow used by Exchange servers to communicate with each other. You'll also explore how to use connectors to send and receive email, and how to use tools to manage and verify mail flow.

This module concludes by examining common troubleshooting scenarios involving message transport coexistence. Coexistence is automatically achieved when an organization's Exchange deployment includes multiple Exchange Servers. Coexistence occurs because an Exchange server automatically fails over to another server if it fails.
