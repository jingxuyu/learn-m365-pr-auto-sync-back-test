quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator at Fabrikam, Holly Spencer has assigned a retention policy to a SharePoint site. None of the content in this site was modified or deleted during the retention period. What happened to the content at the end of the retention period?"
    choices:
    - content: "The content was moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The content is only moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin if a user deletes the content from the first-stage Recycle Bin or empties the first-stage Recycle Bin. Try again."
    - content: "The content was moved to the Preservation Hold library"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When content is subject to a retention policy, and the content is edited or deleted, a copy of the original content is saved to the Preservation Library. In this scenario, none of the content in the site was modified or deleted, so it wasn't moved to the Preservation Library. Try again."
    - content: "The content was moved to the first-stage Recycle Bin"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If the site content wasn't modified or deleted during the retention period, the content is moved to the first-stage Recycle Bin at the end of the retention period. If a user deletes the content from there or empties this Recycle Bin, the content is moved to the second-stage Recycle Bin. A 93-day retention period spans both the first- and second-stage recycle bins. At the end of 93 days, the content is permanently deleted from wherever it is, in either the first- or second-stage Recycle Bin."
