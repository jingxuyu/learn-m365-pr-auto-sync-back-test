Once an organization has begun rolling out Calling for Microsoft Teams, they need to answer questions from their employees about what the changes mean for them. Alongside providing this support, a project will also need to know how to monitor and manage Microsoft Teams call quality and usage.

Suppose you've deployed Calling for Microsoft Teams in a satellite office and are now planning to roll calling out to the rest of your organization. Your project manager has asked you to pull together a common list of questions that employees might have about how they manage their calls using Teams. Your department has also been monitoring the existing deployment and is now producing weekly reports on Teams usage and call quality to the project.

This module answers the frequently asked questions about Calling for Microsoft Teams and shows you how to use the Call Quality Dashboard together with Power BI to build a suite of reports for your project.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Answer commonly asked questions about Calling for Microsoft Teams.
- Monitor call quality and calling issues.
- Review reports and metrics on usage of Calling for Microsoft Teams.
