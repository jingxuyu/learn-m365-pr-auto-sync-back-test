  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following should you consider about the user's phone number when making the cut over?" 
    choices: 
    - content: Ensure that numbers now include the country dial code; for example, +1 for the US. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It's not necessary to configure the country dial code during cutover because it's implied by your telephony provider." 
    - content: Ensure that it's no longer routed to the old system. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "That's correct. This action ensures that call are no longer being passed over to the old PBX or the old Skype for Business environment, but to the new Teams environment." 
    - content: Ensure that the new SIP attribute has been added to the phone number. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The SIP attribute is not critical during number cutover."

  - content: "After running **Get-CsOnlineUser**, you see that **OnPremHostingProvider**, which was SRV, is now sipfed.online.lync.com. Which of the following describes the meaning of this change?" 
    choices: 
    - content: Calls to this user will now go to Skype for Business. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If calls to this user are being routed to Skype for business, this attribute still contains SRV." 
    - content: Calls to this user now bypass the SBC. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You cannot bypass the SBC by using telephony properties in the Active Directory."
    - content: Direct routing is now enabled for the user. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "That's correct. The sipfed.online.lync.com value is only shown when the user has been cut over to Teams Direct Routing."       

  - content: "Which of the following describes how to configure the SBC for dynamic routing?" 
    choices:
    - content: Via an LDAP connection to the domain controller. 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "That's correct. To configure dynamic routing, set your SBC to look up properties about each user in Active Directory before each call is routed."     
    - content: Dynamic routing is enabled on the SBC through PowerShell. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. SBCs are third party devices and don't support PowerShell." 
    - content: By querying the list of users in Teams. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In dynamic routing, the SBC queries information about users in Active Directory, not Teams."

  - content: "Your Skype for Business environment has been decommissioned. A user tells you that their phone number has changed. After running the PowerShell command **Get-CsOnlineUser** for that user, you find **OnPremLineURIManuallySet=True**. Which of the following describes how you'll update the user's phone number?"
    choices: 
    - content: Through Active Directory Users and Groups. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When the value of **OnPremLineURIManuallySet** is false, you can use Active Directory Users and Computers to manage a user's phone number." 
    - content: "Set-CsUser -Identity 'User name' -OnPremLineURI 'new_tel_value'" 
      isCorrect: true 
      explanation: "That's correct. You can only use the **Set-CsUser** cmdlet to configure a user's phone number when **OnPremLineURIManuallySet** is true."
    - content: Edit the number in the SBC. 
      isCorrect: false 
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When the **OnPremLineURIManuallySet** property is false, you can't manage that user's number on the SBC."
