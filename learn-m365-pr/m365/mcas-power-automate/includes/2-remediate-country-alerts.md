If connections to cloud apps originate from unusual countries this is often a sign that it could be some form of attack. Therefore, there are systems in Microsoft Cloud App Security to block unusual country requests. In most scenarios, this is a useful feature, but sometimes it might not be beneficial. Imagine a scenario where a senior business executive has gone on annual leave to a tropical island a long way from home. While they are away, one of the organizations key clients wants to place a large last-minute order. The senior business executive needs to approve an order of this size, but they are blocked from the orders app because they are in an unusual country.

By implementing Power Automate a more sophisticated approach to infrequent country alerts can be implemented. Power Automate uses flows to respond to events and automate tasks. No extra steps are necessary to integrate Power Automate with Microsoft Cloud App Security.

## Steps to remove sensitive file sharing after requesting user validation with Power Automate

To remove sensitive file sharing after requesting user validation with Power Automate, perform the following steps:

1. Create a Power Automate flow that responds to an alert generated by Microsoft Cloud App Security.
2. This flow captures user and manager information, checks to see whether the user has an out-of-office enabled and checks group membership.

3. The next task is a condition that resolves the alert in Microsoft Cloud App Security if out-of-office is turned on and the user is not part of the Executives group.

4. An **If no** can then be added to create a message.

5. This message can then be posted to Teams for the Security Operations Center (SOC) team to resolve.
