In your large firm of financial advisors, your clients trust your advisors with highly confidential and personal information every day. You were concerned to ensure voicemails were as well protected from interception as emails and file-based data. You also had significant numbers of scam phone calls you wanted to block. You've seen in this module that in Microsoft Teams, you can use calling policies, protected voicemail, and caller ID policies to address these security issues.

The rich telephony functionality in Teams can increase the opportunities for malicious users to attack your confidential data or phish for information. In Microsoft Teams, you have flexible tools that you can use to frustrate these attacks without reducing the productivity of your users.
