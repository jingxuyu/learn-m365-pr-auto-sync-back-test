# Module topic statement

Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop is a cloud service that enables you to provide users with a secure remote desktop from anywhere. By using Azure Virtual Desktop, you can plan appropriate BCDR strategies to sustain both unplanned and planned failures and to provide redundancy.

# Module learn objectives

After completing this module, you should know more about:

# ·    How to evaluate and identify a redundancy option for Azure Virtual Desktop. 

# ·    How to plan an appropriate BCDR strategy to sustain both unplanned and planned failures.

**Unit descriptions**

**First unit: Introduction**

**Type of unit:** Introduction unit

**Estimate unit duration:** 3 minutes

**Module scenario**

 

Natural or human-made disasters might affect the continuity of your organization’s cloud infrastructure. Planning for disaster and recovery, and ensuring business-continuity plans are in place and available when needed, are key to any organization’s longevity.

Data loss isn’t the only “disaster” for which IT professionals must plan. A comprehensive disaster-recovery plan also helps ensure business continuity. For example, your plan might involve redirecting requests or failing over to a secondary location when an application becomes unresponsive or a public cloud’s entire region suffers an outage. 

Suppose you work for a financial organization that has offices across many different geolocations. Your organization recently suffered an outage in one of your affiliates. You want to ensure that your Azure infrastructure has the correct configuration to enable replication and recovery in case an unplanned event occurs. Your main concern is your existing Azure Virtual Desktop environment, which your employees who mostly work from home need to access company applications. 

In this module, you’ll  learn how to adopt a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy for Azure Virtual Desktop. You’ll also learn how to keep your apps and workload running during planned and unplanned service or Azure outages.

 

**Second unit: Identify the components to protect**

**Type of unit:** Learning content unit

**Estimate unit duration:** 6 minutes

**Key content per learning objective**

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

- Identify     which components of your virtualization environment you need to protect.
-  
-  

 

**Third unit: Develop a BCDR plan for Azure Virtual Desktop**

**Type of unit:** Learning content unit

**Estimate unit duration:** 10 minutes

**Key content per learning objective**

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

Develop a BCDR plan:

- Choose     from Azure features, region pairing, availability zones, and availability     sets.
- Use     Azure Site Recovery as part of your Azure Virtual Desktop BCDR plan.
- Plan for network resilience.
- Plan     for protection for your FSLogix profiles, applications and dependent     components

 

**Fourth unit: Identify the correct DR scenario**

**Type of unit:** Learning content unit

**Estimate unit duration:** 8 minutes

**Key content per learning objective**

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to identify different DR scenarios, including:

·    The local corruption of data, metadata, or resources. 

·    A single Availability Zone failure within an Azure region’s datacenter.

·    And entire Azure region outage.

 

**Fifth unit: Knowledge Check**

**Type of unit:** Knowledge Check unit

**Estimate unit duration:** 3 minutes

 

**Sixth unit: Summary**

**Type of unit:** Summary unit

**Estimate unit duration:** 2 minutes

**Resolution of module problem**

Your organization required a current, secure, highly scalable Azure Virtual Desktop solution that would support its employees who work remotely and protect them from planned and unplanned failures.

Disaster planning and recovery is a critical element of IT operations, regardless of whether an organization's systems are located on-premises, in the cloud, or a combination of both. Public cloud platforms offer services for backing up critical data, restoring it when lost, failing over to secondary systems when primary systems go down, and mitigating (and recovering from) the effects of failures. 

In this module, you learned how to implement protection of your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. You also learned how to protect your company from different failure scenarios and ensure business continuity.
