All products in Microsoft 365 can be managed with administrative roles in Azure Active Directory. The permission model on which administrator roles are based in Microsoft 365 is referred to as Azure Role-Based Access Control, or Azure RBAC. The Azure RBAC model makes it easy to assign permissions to a user. In Microsoft 365, an administrator can assign each user a role that has predefined permissions assigned to it. So instead of assigning multiple permissions to a user, you assign them a role that has those permissions defined. This model makes permission management much more efficient and effective.

Microsoft 365 provides several predefined administrator roles. Because these roles provide permission to do administrative tasks, you must carefully plan which users they'll be assigned to. It's important that you ensure those people are responsible and trustworthy. Each admin role maps to common business functions and gives people in your organization permissions to do specific tasks in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Other online services have their own permission models. For example, Exchange Online uses a similar Azure RBAC model to define administrator roles, but it also uses a security model based on individual permissions for its mailboxes. SharePoint Online has its own security permission model based on security groups, permissions, and permission levels. This model enables administrators to assign individual permissions or groups of permissions to its resources, such as site collections, sites, and documents.<br>

This training will examine several of the key administrator roles that are available in the Microsoft 365 Azure RBAC model, including:

 -  Exchange Administrator
 -  SharePoint Administrator
 -  Modern Desktop Administrator
 -  Security and Compliance Administrator
 -  Teams Administrator

A Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator typically assigns these roles to users who are responsible for specific Microsoft 365 product areas.

> [!NOTE]
> There are other administrator roles available in the Azure RBAC model (such as Global Administrator, Billing Administrator, and Password Administrator, among others). However, because these roles are more niche roles that aren't product-specific, **they won't be covered in this training**.

**Additional reading.** For more information on all the Azure RBAC roles available in Microsoft 365, see the following article about [Office 365 admin roles](https://support.office.com/article/About-Office-365-admin-roles-da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d?azure-portal=true).
