Microsoft's Threat and Vulnerability Management module is a component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. It effectively identifies, assesses, and remediates endpoint weaknesses. This process is pivotal in running a healthy security program and reducing organizational risk.

The Threat and Vulnerability Management module serves as an infrastructure for reducing organizational exposure, hardening endpoint surface area, and increasing organizational resilience. It uses sensors to discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in real time. This discovery is completed without the need of agents or periodic scans. Threat and Vulnerability Management prioritizes vulnerabilities based on:

 -  the threat landscape
 -  detections in your organization
 -  sensitive information on vulnerable devices
 -  business context

If you've enabled the [integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/azure/defender-for-cloud/integration-defender-for-endpoint?azure-portal=true), you'll automatically get the threat and vulnerability management findings without the need for more agents.

### Bridging the workflow gaps

Threat and Vulnerability Management is built in real time and cloud powered. It's fully integrated with the Microsoft endpoint security stack, the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, and the application analytics knowledge base.

Threat and Vulnerability Management is the first solution in the industry to bridge the gap between security administration and IT administration during the remediation process. It enables organizations to create a security task or ticket by integrating with Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

#### Real-time discovery

To discover endpoint vulnerabilities and misconfiguration, Threat and Vulnerability Management uses the same sensors deployed within Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. These agentless, built-in sensors reduce cumbersome network scans and IT overhead.

Threat and Vulnerability Management also provides:

 -  **Real-time device inventory**. Devices onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint automatically report and push vulnerability and security configuration data to the dashboard.
 -  **Visibility into software and vulnerabilities**. Optics into the organization's software inventory, and software changes like installations, uninstalls, and patches. Newly discovered vulnerabilities are reported with actionable mitigation recommendations for 1st and 3rd party applications.
 -  **Application runtime context**. Visibility on application usage patterns for better prioritization and decision-making.
 -  **Configuration posture**. Visibility into organizational security configuration or misconfigurations. Issues are reported in the dashboard with actionable security recommendations.

### Intelligence-driven prioritization

The Threat and Vulnerability Management module helps customers prioritize and focus on the weaknesses that pose the most urgent and highest risk to an organization. It fuses security recommendations with dynamic threat and business context:

 -  **Exposing emerging attacks in the wild**. Dynamically aligns the prioritization of security recommendations. Threat and vulnerability management focuses on vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild and emerging threats that pose the highest risk.
 -  **Pinpointing active breaches**. Correlates threat and vulnerability management and EDR insights to prioritize vulnerabilities being exploited in an active breach within the organization.
 -  **Protecting high-value assets**. Identify the exposed devices with business-critical applications, confidential data, or high-value users.

### Seamless remediation

The Threat and Vulnerability Management module enables security administrators and IT administrators to collaborate seamlessly to remediate issues.

 -  **Remediation requests sent to IT**. Create a remediation task in Microsoft Intune from a specific security recommendation. This capability is in the process of being expanded to other IT security management platforms.
 -  **Alternate mitigations**. Gain insights on other mitigations, such as configuration changes that can reduce risk associated with software vulnerabilities.
 -  **Real-time remediation status**. Real-time monitoring of the status and progress of remediation activities across the organization.

### Threat and Vulnerability Management walk-through

Today's process for discovery, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities needs improvement. Currently, a separation of duties causes long delays from detecting vulnerabilities until remediation. The following timeline is a common scenario in many organizations:

1.  Security Operations teams analyze breach incidents and remediate attacks.
2.  Security Administration teams discover and prioritize risks and ensure the company meets compliance requirements.
3.  IT administration remediates the risk with configuration changes, updates, and patches.

Wouldn't it be beneficial if these teams could work better together? The Threat and Vulnerability Management module bridges the gap between these roles. It empowers organizations to get and stay secure. Threat and Vulnerability Management helps organizations discover vulnerabilities and misconfiguration in real-time. There are no periodic scans.

With Threat and Vulnerability Management, organizations get a holistic, real-time approach to mature their vulnerability management program. It does so by providing the following automated, end-to-end vulnerability remediation process:

1.  When Security Operations analyzes alerts, they see relevant context about vulnerabilities and misconfiguration for the impacted machines.
2.  At the same time, Security Administration can watch the exposure score go up when vulnerabilities are discovered.
3.  With the push of a button, a Security Administrator can submit a remediation request.
4.  This request goes directly to the IT Administrator. It includes all the context and insights about the required mitigation.
5.  The IT Administrator approves the request and prepares to push the update to all exposed machines.
6.  While IT is updating, Microsoft's security teams can keep track of the updates progress as business gets back to normal.

### Dashboard insights - threat and vulnerability management

The Threat and Vulnerability Management module provides both security administrators and security operations teams with unique value, including:

 -  Real-time endpoint detection and response (EDR) insights correlated with endpoint vulnerabilities.
 -  Invaluable device vulnerability context during incident investigations.
 -  Built-in remediation processes through Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

An organization can use the Threat and Vulnerability Management capability in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to:

 -  View the following security data:
     -  its exposure score
     -  its Microsoft Secure Score for Devices
     -  top security recommendations
     -  software vulnerability
     -  remediation activities
     -  exposed devices
 -  Correlate EDR insights with endpoint vulnerabilities and process them.
 -  Select remediation options to triage and track the remediation tasks.
 -  Select exception options and track active exceptions.

> [!NOTE]
> Devices must be active in the last 30 days to be factored in on the data that reflects an organization's threat and vulnerability management exposure score and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices.
