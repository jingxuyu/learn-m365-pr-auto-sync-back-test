If you are migrating to Exchange Online from Exchange Server on-premises, or if you run these systems together on a long-term basis, configuration mistakes can impact mail flow.

Suppose you work for a company that sells digital cameras. You are in the process of migrating your email services from Exchange Server on-premises to run Exchange Online. You are migrating groups of users one at a time. Some migration operations have failed, and some emails have not arrived as expected for newly migrated users. You want to resolve these issues before completing the migration and phasing out Exchange Server.

In this module, you'll learn how to troubleshoot issues that arise in hybrid Exchange environments.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Enable mail to flow between Exchange Online and Exchange Server recipients correctly.
- Resolve issues with free/busy information, public folders, and recipient synchronization in hybrid deployments.
- Troubleshoot issues that arise during a migration.
