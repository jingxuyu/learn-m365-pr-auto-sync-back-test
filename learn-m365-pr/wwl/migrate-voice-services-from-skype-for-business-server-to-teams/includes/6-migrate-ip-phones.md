After migrating Skype for Business Server users enabled for Enterprise Voice, and common area phones, you may need to migrate Skype for Business IP phones to Microsoft Teams.

Before migrating Skype for Business Server IP phones, ensure you have validated compatibility with Microsoft Teams.

Some Skype for Business IP phones are upgradable to native Microsoft Teams functionality. These phones are known as Teams-capable Phones.

Other Skype for Business certified IP phones / 3PIP phones will continue to work with Microsoft Teams with a specific set of functionalities, as these phones access Teams via a Skype for Business Online gateway service.

If you have Teams Capable phones, consult your vendor for recommendations on upgrading the existing Skype for Business compatible firmware to Teams native firmware. You should plan and align the upgrade to the Teams user interface on the phone to coincide with the migration of the user or common area phone to Teams.

For IP phones certified for Skype for Business, the Skype for Business phones support a limited number of core functionalities listed below.<br>

Both Skype for Business IP phones and Teams Capable Phones should expect users or common area phones to sign in after the account is migrated to Microsoft Teams. For Teams Capable Phones, they may be able to support remote provisioning functionality described later in the module Configure, deploy, and manage Teams devices.
