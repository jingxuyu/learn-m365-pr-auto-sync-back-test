Your company wanted to effectively deploy and measure the impact of some initiatives designed to streamline ways of working, reduce burnout risk, and boost manager effectiveness. To do this, you needed data tracking employees' work behaviors and collaboration patterns.

By using the Ways of working assessment dashboard in Power BI, you got the insights that enabled your CHRO to understand how long and through what modes people across your company collaborate. You identified pockets of burnout risk and trends in manager coaching. Your CHRO can now prioritize transformation initiatives based on need, and focus interventions on the employee groups who will benefit the most.

It would be difficult to build a similar report from scratch without the Viva Insights data in Workplace Analytics  and the Ways of working assessment dashboard. Even if your CHRO has approval to access raw collaboration data, you would have to figure out how to gather it for all users, make sense of it, calculate business metrics, and maintain employee privacy and data security. Only then could you build your Ways of working assessment report.

The Ways of working assessment helped you quantify the impact of your company's cultural transformation and recommend measurable changes that boost employee engagement, increase productivity, and unlock more agile ways of working, saving valuable time for people across the entire organization.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Explain what the Ways of working Assessment dashboard in Power BI is, and why it provides an important perspective.
- Use the Query designer for template setup and to load the data and select the dashboard settings in Power BI.
- Interpret the report results in the dashboard.
