Microsoft Defender for Office 365 complements Exchange Online Protection (EOP) by providing protection against specific types of advanced threats, including phishing and zero-day attacks. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 employs the following tools to provide a wide range of threat protection:

 -  **Safe Attachments.** This tool scans email attachments for malware. Safe Attachments protects against unknown malware and viruses and provides zero-day protection to safeguard your messaging system. All messages and attachments that don’t have a known virus/malware signature are routed to a special environment where Microsoft Defender uses various machine learning and analysis techniques to detect malicious intent. If no suspicious activity is detected, the message is released for delivery to the mailbox.
 -  **Safe Links.** This tool scans web addresses (URLs) in email messages and Office documents. Safe Links proactively protects your users from malicious hyperlinks in a message. The protection is enforced every time they select the link. Malicious links are dynamically blocked while good links are accessible.
 -  **Advanced threat protection for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.** These tools identify and block malicious files in online libraries.
 -  **Anti-phishing.** This functionality detects when someone attempts to impersonate your users and your organization's custom domains. The anti-phishing capabilities apply a set of machine learning models and impersonation detection algorithms to incoming messages to provide protection for commodity and spear phishing attacks.
 -  **Anti-malware.** This tool protects your organization's email from malware, including what actions to take and who to notify if malware is detected.
 -  **Spoof intelligence.** This functionality checks email messages for spam with unauthorized spoofing.
