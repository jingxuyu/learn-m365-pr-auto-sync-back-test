SharePoint Online is an Intranet-based website application. It enables companies to collaborate and manage content across the span of their network and beyond. Since SharePoint Online is a managed service, anyone of your companyâ€™s users can access the SharePoint Online experience if there's an internet connection.

SharePoint Online is used for many different purposes and can be managed from either Windows PowerShell or through the SharePoint admin center. Some functions may be unavailable because SharePoint Online is a managed service. However, companies can have other management options by setting up a hybrid environment. A hybrid deployment dictates that changes be made on-premises versus in the cloud. It also allows for greater PowerShell management. Some of the key benefits to using SharePoint Online include:

 -  Local Site management
 -  Encryption Services
