  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso recently purchased a dozen new Windows 10 devices. Contoso's Enterprise Administrator, Holly Dickson, wants to use Windows Autopilot user-driven mode to transform the devices from their initial state directly from the factory into a ready-to-use state without requiring Contoso's IT personnel to ever touch them. Which of the following steps must Holly complete in preparation to deploying Windows Autopilot in user-driven mode?"
    choices:
    - content: "Ensure the users who will be performing user-driven mode deployments can join devices to on-premises Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Users who perform user-driven deployments must have permission to join devices to Azure Active Directory, not on-premises Active Directory. Try again."
    - content: "Create an Autopilot profile for user-driven mode with the required settings"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Holly must create an Autopilot profile for user-driven mode with the required settings. In Microsoft Intune, this mode is explicitly chosen when creating the profile."
    - content: "Add the devices to Microsoft Intune"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't a step Holly must complete in preparation to deploying Windows Autopilot in user-driven mode. Try again."
