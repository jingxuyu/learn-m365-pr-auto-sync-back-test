In this unit you'll look at the envision phase in more detail, you'll gather your team together, and use Teams itself to begin planning Teams adoption. This approach will increase your technical familiarity with the product and help you to build the skills necessary to successfully complete later phases.

At this stage in the rollout project, you need to identify the people who will make up your team and the roles they should be assigned.

## Adoption prerequisites

Before getting started, an administrator should ensure that:

- *Teams is installed* and *licenses are assigned* in your environment. At a minimum, licenses should be assigned to your core team and to the early adopters participating in this initial project phase.
- Desktop and mobile applications are downloaded.

## Assemble your team

No matter how large or small your organization, you'll want to bring together a team that includes your key stakeholders. This table contains suggestions for the core roles you'll need on your project team. In smaller organizations, some of these roles may be filled by the same person. Roles in **bold** are essential to the success of your project and should be the first you assign. The remaining roles are also important and can help improve the chances your program is a success.

| Role                            | Responsibilities                                                                                                     | Department                             |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Executive Sponsor**           | Communicate high-level vision. Connect Teams implementation to core mission and priority initiatives at the company. | Executive Leadership                   |
| **Success Owner**               | Ensure the business goals are realized from the Teams rollout.                                                       | Any department                         |
| Program Manager                 | Oversee the entire Teams launch execution and rollout process.                                                       | IT                                     |
| **Champions**                   | Early adopters who will help evangelize Teams, support skill building, and provide usage insights.                                           | Multiple departments                   |
| Training Lead                   | Manage and communicate training content about Teams.                                                                 | IT or other                            |
| Department Leads (Stakeholders) | Identify how specific departments will use Teams and encourage engagement.                                           | Any department (management)            |
| **IT Specialists**              | Oversee all technical aspects of implementation, including integrations.                                             | IT                                     |
| Communication Lead              | Oversee company-wide communications about Teams.                                                                     | Corporate Communications, IT, or other |
| Community Manager               | Manage day-to-day Yammer network activity. Provide guidance and best practices.                                      | Multiple departments                   |

It's important that you and the rest of the rollout project team commit to using Teams chat, channels, and resources to manage the roll out project. By modeling the behavior you want the rest of your company to embrace, you increase the likelihood of successful adoption by the rest of the company. Set the tone, go first, and enjoy having your project information all in one place.

### Identify your stakeholders

List the core stakeholders and business leaders in your organization. This helps you identify executive sponsors and success owners. Getting senior leadership buy in to any project helps it succeed. Once you have compiled your list, for each stakeholder, consider the following questions and then use the comments below to review your results:

- Is this person friendly to new technology?
- How would you rate what this person's satisfaction with your current technology is?
- Is this person under a high degree of pressure to deliver key business results?
- Will this person be willing to evangelize his/her experience with Teams to help the transition?
- Does this person have a positive relationship with key members of the existing project team?
- Does this person like to be viewed as an "agent of change" within the organization?

You can add additional questions that are relevant to your organization. For your initial two phases (envision and onboard), you'll see leaders who are friendly to change, dissatisfied with current technology, and that you have a good relationship with. These leaders should be brought into the core project team as business advisors and may have projects that will be essential for the onboarding phase.

While it's possible to assign a score to this sort of questionnaire that alone would not paint a complete picture. Driving change depends on the chemistry of the team as much as their technical skill or business acumen. Review this list with your team members to discuss the "fit" of your various leaders with this project as you select projects and staff for subsequent phases.

### Identify your champions

To make the roll out of Teams a true success, you'll need people in your organization who are passionate and willing to evangelize. Your projects champions will typically share these traits:

- Interested in technology
- Willing to be a part of change
- Seeking to make improvements
- Collaborative by nature
- Willing to share their observations and learnings with the group
- Are risk takers, as they're willing to try something to see if it works

Create a form in Microsoft Forms to allow these individuals to opt into an early adopter program for Teams. Depending on the size and complexity of your organization, you may choose to use some or all of these individuals as your champions. Make it clear that as Teams champions, they are agreeing to actively participate in your onboarding phase and provide regular feedback to the project team. Their responsibilities as a champion are to:

- Create a ground swell of enthusiasm that increases adoption.
- Influence their peers and be willing to share their experience.
- Bring the new ways of working to life across teams.
- Identify business challenges and possible solutions.
- Reduce strain on core project team through active, ongoing engagement.

Once you've identified likely candidates, consider asking them to join Microsoft's Champions Program. They'll get support from other champions and ideas on how they can support the organizations use of Teams. For more information, see the link in the **Learn more** section below.

## Define the roll-out strategy

Many projects across your company would likely lend themselves to being migrated to Teams. One of these projects could be used as a Teams pilot. In addition, leaders or divisions inside of an organization might want a dedicated pilot for their own people. You'll make use of the stakeholder analysis you've done to choose appropriate teams or pilot projects for the later stages of the rollout. Consider the organizational and project models shown in the following illustration below:

:::image type="content" border="false" source="../media/3-organizational-and-project-model.png" alt-text="Organizational and Project Models" lightbox="../media/3-organizational-and-project-model.png":::

In an organizational team (shown on the left side of the image above), key information about the way that organization runs its business, team events, core strategies, and other operational information, such as business reviews, might be shared. For the team shown on the right, the district's information is broken down into channels that represent the categories of work that are being accomplished by that team. Members of this team may or may not report to the same person, but they are all engaged in driving the results for the district.
Thinking in these terms, you can shape the rollout strategy to focus on a mixture of models. Which departments make a good candidate for using Teams first? Likewise, are there any ideal projects that would be able to handle a move to Teams without impacting their delivery?

You'll work more on the structure of your teams in phase 2 of your implementation.

## Determine your organization's readiness for change

Change is a human process that has nothing to do with technology. There is behavioral psychology and neuroscience that educates us about the natural resistance to change. To make change acceptable, it's critical to anticipate the needs of your users, express your understanding of their situation, and create solutions that improve that situation. Even in doing so you, will encounter natural resistance to change.

:::image type="content" border="false" source="../media/4-teams-adoption-resistance.png" alt-text="Teams Adoption Resistance":::

Every organization approaches change differently, depending on region, work style, professional profile, and other elements of the organization. To assess your organization's readiness, see **Assess organizational change readiness** in the **Learn more** section below. Use the guidelines to answer the following questions:

1. What percentage of users fall into each bucket? Use this to assess change resistance.
    - *Early adopter*: request the solution before it's available.
    - *Informed users*: use the solution once its value is proven.
    - *Dissenters*: push back on any change.
1. What is the users' competency for change? Use this to assess training options.
    - Self-starters require only a link to a video.
    - Team builders do well with group training.
    - One-to-one learners require personal support.
1. In addition to this service deployment, how many other changes are happening? Use this to assess adaptability. Changes could include Office/Windows upgrades, office moves, mergers, reorgs, and so on.
    - None
    - 1-3 changes
    - More than three changes

Combine this data with the stakeholder profiles and employees who wish to opt in for the early adopter program. This will let you identify groups that are ready for and can absorb change alongside their existing duties. This method will allow you to create partners in change.

You can use internal champions to address the problem of having different change types. Feedback is the key to success: encourage people to share their challenges and needs. Embrace disrupters and dissenters by giving these individuals or groups a seat at the table during onboarding. This best practice will pave the way for a smoother broad deployment of your collaboration improvements.
