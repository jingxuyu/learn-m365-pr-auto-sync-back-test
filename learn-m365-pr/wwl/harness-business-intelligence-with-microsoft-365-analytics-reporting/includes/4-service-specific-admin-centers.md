The Microsoft 365 admin center is the common entry point for all Microsoft 365 admins. Use your admin account to access it at [admin.microsoft.com.](https://admin.microsoft.com/)

If you want to see reports about a specific area, such as **Security & Compliance**, or **Device management**, expand the navigation menu to find the additional **Admin centers** at the bottom.

Each specialist admin center gives you more options for that specific area. The menu gives you a list of additional admin centers, each with their own reports, including:

 -  **Security & Compliance**. Includes a collective security score including the state of identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure.
 -  **SharePoint**. Get a high-level view of the value you are getting from SharePoint in terms of the total number of files that users store in SharePoint sites, how many files are actively being used, and the storage consumed across all these sites. Then, you can drill into the SharePoint site usage report to understand the trends and per site level details for all sites.
 -  **Teams**. In the Microsoft Teams user activity report, you can gain insights into the Microsoft Teams activity in your organization. Get a view into activity by looking at the Activity and Users charts.
 -  **Exchange**. Get a high-level view of email traffic within your organization. Drill into the Email activity widget to understand the trends and per user level details of the email activity within your organization.
 -  **Device Management**. Microsoft Intune reporting allows you to proactively monitor the health and activity of endpoints across your organization. You can see reports about device compliance, device health, and device trends. In addition, you can create custom reports to obtain more specific data.
