With Microsoft 365 services, you can create a secure and productive file collaboration environment for your users. While SharePoint contains the actual files, the capabilities of file collaboration in Microsoft 365 extend to Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and various governance and security options as well.

Imagine you're an administrator and need to understand the many options and decisions to consider when setting up a collaboration environment. In this module, you'll see how to manage access and sharing across team sites, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Teams. You'll then configure file and folder sharing for the best user experience while keeping your organization's confidential information safe. With the configuration complete you'll see how to share access to your files with guests externally.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

  - Explain how file collaboration works in SharePoint.
