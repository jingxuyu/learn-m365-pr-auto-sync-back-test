During setup, Azure AD Connect automatically creates Azure AD Connect Sync Security Groups. A Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator can use these groups to:

 -  delegate control in Azure AD Connect to other users.
 -  assign a user temporary permission to run a manual synchronization.
 -  troubleshoot directory synchronization issues using Azure AD Connect.

The following table identifies the Azure AD Connect Sync Security Groups that are automatically created by Azure AD Connect.

To create domain groups on member servers, select the **Specify Custom Sync Groups** option during setup and specify the groups by Domain\\Group Name.
