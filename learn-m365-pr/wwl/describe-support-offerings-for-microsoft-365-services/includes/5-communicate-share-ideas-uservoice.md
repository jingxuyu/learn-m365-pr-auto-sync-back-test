There’s always room for improvement, and Microsoft is committed to improving its services. Your organization’s administrators and users often have great insight into how specific bits and pieces of services can be improved based on their daily experiences. Microsoft encourages idea sharing to improve services for everybody.

Your organization can submit feedback about Microsoft 365 services performance and user experience.  Microsoft has partnered with UserVoice to enable you and other Microsoft 365 services customers to share ideas about how you think Microsoft can improve services and experiences. This is the best way to make sure your voice is heard. UserVoice makes it possible for you to use dedicated forums for each service, to post your ideas and get responses from Microsoft about whether certain functionalities and features are already in progress, or if they can be included in future updates.

For example, the [Microsoft Teams UserVoice](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public) site shows that your suggestions and feedback are monitored and directly presented to the Customer Advocacy Team inside Microsoft Teams Engineering:

You can see that the team has provided information about their dedicated product blog and access to the roadmap for future features.

Users in your organizations can easily share their ideas with the team and they will respond appropriately:

You can find UserVoice forums for all your Microsoft 365 services, for example:

- [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/)

- [Word](https://word.uservoice.com/)
- [Microsoft Planner](https://planner.uservoice.com/forums/330525-microsoft-planner-feedback-forum)

Take advantage of UserVoice sites to contribute directly, and help improve Microsoft services for your organization and other users around the world.
