Devices that are installed can be found in either the Control Panel or Settings App. Device Manager is used for managing the device driver itself.

## Devices in the Settings app

You can perform common device management by using the Devices section in the Settings app in Windows. The interface is optimized for touch, and includes links to Device Manager and to Devices and Printers for advanced management. You can add and remove printers, wireless, and other devices here, as well as configure settings on devices such as a mouse or keyboard. You can also configure what happens when removable devices are plugged in and removed, such as USB media.

## Devices in the Control Panel

After you connect an external device, it appears in Devices and Printers in Control Panel. You can also add and remove devices here as well, however Devices and Printers may display additional devices and provide advance configuration options. For example, if wireless headphones are connected with a wireless usb transmitter, the Settings app may show only the headphones, where the Control Panel may show the headphones and the USB wireless transmitter.

## Device Manager

You can use Device Manager to:

 -  Install and update device drivers
 -  Disable or enable devices
 -  Use the Driver Roll Back feature
 -  Change resources that devices use, such as interrupt requests (IRQs)
 -  Troubleshoot device problems
 -  View devices that are connected currently to your network, and the resources that they're using

When viewing the devices that are connected to your network, you can sort them by device type or connection. The Device Manager view updates dynamically when the status of a connected device changes. You can also update it manually by selecting the option to scan for hardware changes.
