We recommend starting an OKR coaching session with the first OKR question on objectives:   

***“What is the most important area of our business we need to focus on?”***

Asking this question helps an individual or team conclude where they should spend their time and effort and clarifies what they want to accomplish.   

As a pro-tip, this is a great time to use a whiteboard, or sticky notes both in-person and virtually to get folks brainstorming and set up objective ideas for later conversation.   

Let’s walk through a scenario in which this question (and follow ups) unfolds. 


| Attendees  |Coach  |
|---------|---------|
| <br> | *What is the most important area of your business you need to focus on?* |“We need to evolve our Surface business”      |   *What does that mean, evolve?*       |
|We need to increase the efficacy of our sellers, onboard new partners, and delve deeper into the enterprise.     |   *I hear you saying things like "enterprise," "efficacy;" how would you summarize those areas into an inspirational statement?*        |
|We need to transform Surface into an enterprise business.      |  *Great!  There’s an objective to start, "Transform Surface into an enterprise Business." Is that statement something your team will find inspirational?*        |
|I think so. We’ve always focused on consumer and enterprise is a completely different challenge for us.      |    *Why is this important for us to focus on?*      |
|The enterprise business is our largest potential growth driver.  Our competitors are doubling down.    |  *Excellent. We’ve gone ahead and identified a key area of focus for your group, ensured it was inspirational, and defined why it's important for us to focus our efforts here.  That’s what we’ll be doing for future objectives as well.*        |

Once you have a solid first draft of the objective, we recommend checking it against this rubric with the team.  

- Does the objective define a specific area of focus?

- Is the objective qualitative?

- Does the objective inspire our team?

- Is the objective relevant for our business?

<br> *Let’s apply this rubric to the objective we reached in our scenario example:*

**Scenario Example:**
-

**Objective: Transform Surface to be an Enterprise Business**

Key Result: To be completed in a later module.

Key Result: To be completed in a later module.

Key Result: To be completed in a later module.

Project: To be completed in a later module.

Project: To be completed in a later module.

 When looking at the above rubric, we can check each of the requirements off.  As noted through the team’s conversation, the objective does define an area of focus, is qualitative, inspires their team and is relevant for their business.   

But they’re not done yet!  Now that the team has defined their objective, they need to move onto defining the outcomes that they’re aiming to achieve in the form of key results.  This is where things start to get more challenging.
