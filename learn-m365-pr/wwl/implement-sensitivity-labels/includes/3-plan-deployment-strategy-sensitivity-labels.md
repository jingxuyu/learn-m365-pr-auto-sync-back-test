To successfully deploy sensitivity labels, an organization should create a project team that identifies and manages the:

 -  business and technical requirements.
 -  proof of concept testing.
 -  internal checkpoints and approvals.
 -  final deployment for the production environment.

It's recommended that organizations use the table in the next section to identify its top one or two scenarios that map to its most impactful business requirements. After an organization deploys these scenarios, it should return to the list to identify the next one or two priorities for deployment.

### Common scenarios for sensitivity labels

All scenarios require organizations to create and configure sensitivity labels and their policies.

### End-user documentation for sensitivity labels

The most effective end-user documentation that an organization can provide will be customized guidance and instructions for the label names and configurations it chooses. Organizations can use the label policy setting **Provide users with a link to a custom help page** to specify an internal link for this documentation. Users can then easily access it from the **Sensitivity** button:

 -  **For built-in labeling**: See the **Learn More** menu option.
 -  **For the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client**. Go to the **Help** and **Feedback** menu option &gt; **Tell Me More** link in the Microsoft Azure Information Protection dialog box.

To help organizations provide customized documentation, see the following page and downloads they can use to help train their users: [End User Training for Sensitivity Labels](https://microsoft.github.io/ComplianceCxE/enduser/sensitivity/?azure-portal=true).

You can also use the following resources for basic instructions:
