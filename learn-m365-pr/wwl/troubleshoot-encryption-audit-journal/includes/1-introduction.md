Exchange Online has industry-leading encryption, auditing, and journaling tools to ensure security for your email users. However, when these tools are incorrectly configured, it can be challenging to diagnose and fix the problem.

Suppose you work for a company that helps disadvantaged youth. You use encryption to secure sensitive information about these clients in emails and auditing and journaling to record operations. However, this tight security has caused some problems with emails that could not be opened and administrative operations that were not recorded properly. You must find out the causes of these problems as quickly as possible.

In this module, you will learn how to troubleshoot issues with email encryption, audit records, and journaling in Exchange Online.

At the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Diagnose why Exchange Online can't encrypt or decrypt messages as intended.
