When you move to the cloud, you have to map your needs to the different types of cloud services: SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS. You’ll also figure out the best implementation: purely cloud-based or working in tandem with some on-premises systems.

In this lesson, we’ll discuss how companies can work purely in the cloud (“cloud-only”) or connect existing on-premises systems to the cloud to extend the value of their legacy infrastructure (“hybrid”). You’ll see how these two different service models require different approaches to migration, and then you’ll review a few scenarios that demonstrate when to choose one type of migration over the other. Finally, we’ll review some considerations for how an organization approaches migrating systems with older versions of Office, Windows, and Office Server to Microsoft 365.

## Learning objectives

When you finish this module, you should be able to: :

- List the considerations to keep in mind when selecting a cloud service.
- Understand terminology associated with adopting a cloud service.
- Describe cloud-only and hybrid migration models and how to choose between them.
- Recommend when an organization might want to move systems with older operating systems and Microsoft Office directly to Microsoft 365 instead of upgrading legacy software.
