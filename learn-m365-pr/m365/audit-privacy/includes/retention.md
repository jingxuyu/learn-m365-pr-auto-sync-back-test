For most customers, the volume and complexity of their data is increasingâ€”email, documents, instant messages, and more. Effectively planning for data retention needs and where stored data will be located is important.

## Storage location

Microsoft has an ever-expanding network of datacenters across the globe to make sure data stays close to customers whenever possible, and is documented in our contracts. See the **Learn more** section of this module for links to online service data residency details.

- We do not control or limit the locations from which a customer or users may access, copy, or move customer data. Customers and their end users may move, copy, or access their customer data from any location globally.
- Microsoft complies with international data protection laws for transfers of customer data across borders.

## Data retention

Regulatory compliance, internal governance requirements, or litigation risks may require organizations to preserve email and associated data in a discoverable form and prevent destruction or alteration ("immutability"). Through in-place retention and preservation policy features of archiving in Microsoft 365 and its services, Microsoft can preserve and retain many classes of incoming, internal, and outgoing data. This includes:

- Inbound and outbound email communications
- Books and records contained in email form or in shared online documents
- Meeting requests
- Faxes
- Instant messages
- Documents shared during online meetings
- Voicemails

In addition, Microsoft has developed add-on features to allow archiving of data from other sources through integration with third-party data capturing and management solutions. After third-party data is imported, customers can apply Microsoft Purview features to the data, including:

- Litigation Hold
- In-Place eDiscovery and Hold
- Compliance Search
- In-Place Archiving
- Mailbox auditing
- Retention Policies
