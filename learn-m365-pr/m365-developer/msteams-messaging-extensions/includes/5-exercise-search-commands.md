In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to execute a messaging extension search command from an existing message.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exercise assumes you have created the Microsoft Teams app project with the Yeoman generator.

## Add a new search messaging extension to the Teams app

In a previous exercise, you created an action messaging extension that enabled a user to add the details of a planet to a message.

In this section, you'll add a search messaging extension to find a specific planet.

### Use the Yeoman Generator to add a search messaging extension

In the folder containing the solution from the previous exercise, run the Yeoman Generator for Microsoft Teams by running the following command:

```console
yo teams
```

Yeoman will launch and ask you a series of questions. Answer the questions with the following values:

- **You are running the generator on an already existing project, "Planet Messaging", are you sure you want to continue?**: Yes
- **Do you want to change the current manifest version (1.10)?**: No
- **Quick scaffolding**: Yes
- **What features do you want to add to your project?**: A Message Extension Command
- **Where is your message extension hosted?**: In a bot or Messaging Extension already defined in this project
- **Choose which bot**: {{MICROSOFT_APP_ID}}
- **What type of messaging extension command?**: Search based messaging extension
- **Would you like a Settings option for the messaging extension?**: No
- **What is the name of your Message Extension command?**: PlanetLookup
- **Describe your Message Extension command?**: Search for a planet

The generator will prompt for overwriting files. Enter `y` for each prompt.

### Update the app's configuration

You must increment the version of the app to upgrade an existing installed version. Use the following command to increment the version:

```console
npm version patch
```

The generator created the `composeExtensions` entry for the new Messaging Extension. Locate and open the **./src/manifest/manifest.json** file.

Next, locate the `composeExtensions.commands` array. Update the array item with the ID of `planeLookupMessageExtension` so that it has the following properites:

```json
{
  "id": "planetLookupMessageExtension",
  "type": "query",
  "title": "Planet Lookup",
  "description": "Search for a planet.",
  "context": ["compose"],
  "initialRun": false,
  "parameters": [{
    "name": "searchKeyword",
    "description": "Enter 'inner','outer' or the name of a specific planet",
    "title": "Planet"
  }]
}
```

### Update the bot code

The next step is to update the bot's code. 

Locate and open the bot in the file **./src/server/planetLookupMessageExtension/PlanetLookupMessageExtension.ts**.

Update the `import` statement for the **botbuilder** package to include the `Attachment` objects:

```typescript
import {
  TurnContext,
  CardFactory, 
  MessagingExtensionQuery, 
  MessagingExtensionResult,
  Attachment
} from "botbuilder";
```

The scaffolded project has a default implementation of the query handler, in the `onQuery` method in the `PlanetLookupMessageExtension` class. In this exercise, that implementation is not used. Remove the contents of the `onQuery` method and replace with the following:

```typescript
public async onQuery(context: TurnContext, query: MessagingExtensionQuery): Promise<MessagingExtensionResult> {
  // get the search query
  let searchQuery = "";
  if (query && query.parameters && query.parameters[0].name === "searchKeyword" && query.parameters[0].value) {
    searchQuery = query.parameters[0].value.trim().toLowerCase();
  }

  // load planets
  const planets: any = require("./planets.json");
  // search results
  let queryResults: string[] = [];

  switch (searchQuery) {
    case "inner":
      // get all planets inside asteroid belt
      queryResults = planets.filter((planet) => planet.id <= 4);
      break;
    case "outer":
      // get all planets outside asteroid belt
      queryResults = planets.filter((planet) => planet.id > 4);
      break;
    default:
      // get the specified planet
      queryResults.push(planets.filter((planet) => planet.name.toLowerCase() === searchQuery)[0]);
  }

  // get the results as cards
  const searchResultsCards: MessagingExtensionAttachment[] = [];
  queryResults.forEach((planet) => {
    searchResultsCards.push(this.getPlanetResultCard(planet));
  });

  const response: MessagingExtensionResponse = {
    composeExtension: {
      type: "result",
      attachmentLayout: "list",
      attachments: searchResultsCards
    }
  } as MessagingExtensionResponse;

  return Promise.resolve(response);
}
```

This method will first get the search keyword from the query sent to the bot from Microsoft Teams. It then will retrieve planets based on three different queries:

- **inner**: this will return all the planets inside the asteroid belt (*Mercury to Mars*)
- **outer**: this will return all planets outside the asteroid belt (*Jupiter to Neptune*)
- *keyword*: this will retrieve the specific planet entered

It will then take the query results, convert them to cards and add them to the `MessagingExtensionResult` returned to the Bot Framework and ultimately to Microsoft Teams.

Lastly, add the following utility method to the `PlanetLookupMessageExtension` class to create the card for each search result:

```typescript
private getPlanetResultCard(selectedPlanet: any): MessagingExtensionAttachment {
  return CardFactory.heroCard(selectedPlanet.name, selectedPlanet.summary, [selectedPlanet.imageLink]);
}
```

### Test the updated messaging extension

From the command line, navigate to the root folder for the project and execute the following command:

```console
gulp ngrok-serve --debug
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recall from a previous exercise, Ngrok will create a new subdomain. You need to update your bot registration's **Messaging endpoint** in the Azure portal (*shown in a previous exercise*) with this new domain before testing it.

First, update the existing installed version of the bot. Upload the zip file from the **package** directory.

After updating the app, go back to the 1:1 chat where you tested the messaging extension in the previous exercise. Select the **Planet Messaging** icon below the compose message box in the chat. This will now present the search experience.

Enter the string **outer** in the search box and wait a few seconds. Microsoft Teams will execute the search and return the results:

## Summary

In this exercise, you learned how to execute a messaging extension search command from an existing message.
