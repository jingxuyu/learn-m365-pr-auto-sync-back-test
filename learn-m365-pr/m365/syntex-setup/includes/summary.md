To better support Human Resources' document understanding and compliance maintenance, Contoso Electronics took part in a staged rollout of SharePoint Syntex. Your project team selected the Human Resources department's content library as the first target. To ensure document confidentiality, you chose to create an additional content center dedicated to just Human Resources content named _"Contoso Electronics Human Resources content center"_. You worked alongside the Human Resources management team to set up SharePoint Syntex on the Human Resources SharePoint library.

Now that you've completed this module, you should know how to:

- Check the prerequisites for setting up and using SharePoint Syntex.
- Understand licensing, AI Builder credits, and requirements for SharePoint Syntex.
