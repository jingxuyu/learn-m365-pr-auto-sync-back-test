Apps managed by Intune are all deployed using the same overall process no matter what application type is being installed. From Intune, Administrators ensure that apps are supported, create a user or device group, add the app to Intune, assign the app to a group, configure policies, and then monitor results of the deployment. For devices that are not enrolled with Intune, device users must go to their organizations Company Portal and manually install apps and app updates that are made available by an organizationâ€™s administrator.

Microsoft 365 apps are already available within Intune and can be assigned to Windows client and macOS devices. In addition to using Intune to manage and deploy Microsoft 365 apps, organizations can also use Configuration Manager, the Office Deployment Tool, the Office Customization Tool, or by end-users installing themselves directly from the Microsoft 365 portal.

In Windows 10 and later, Microsoft Edge is the default browser experience. Microsoft Edge introduced a feature called IE Mode that allows Edge to render legacy sites. Intune can be used to monitor the compliance status and version information of apps that have been assigned to users or devices in the Apps blade within the Endpoint Manager admin center.
