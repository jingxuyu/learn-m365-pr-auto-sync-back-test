    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "What is an effective way to increase users’ awareness of and participation in identity security best practices?"
      choices:
      - content: "Implement a policy that requires users to reset passwords every 30 days."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Frequent password reset requirements lead users to choose weak passwords."
      - content: "Implement an authentication procedure that is both secure and easy to use."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Users are more likely to adopt identity security measures that combine security with ease of use."
      - content: "Restrict non-administrative staff from using personal mobile devices to access the organization’s network."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Users might find this policy too restrictive; it would not encourage users to adopt organization identity security best practices."
    - content: "Fabrikam recently deployed Microsoft 365. One of its developers is building a mobile app for use by company staff. The developer wants the app to identify the user’s role at sign-in and asks your advice on how to implement this capability efficiently. How would you respond?"
      choices:
      - content: "Recommend registering the app with the Microsoft identity platform and executing a call to the Microsoft Graph API."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "This is the most efficient method because the developer can use the Microsoft Graph API functionality to access an Azure AD identity."
      - content: "Advise the developer to require that users enter their role when they sign in to the app."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The app would still need to include a procedure to verify the user role."
      - content: "Suggest that the developer build the role lookup functionality into the app by querying the company’s HR database."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This would not be efficient because it would require extra coding."
