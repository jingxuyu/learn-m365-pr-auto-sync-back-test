  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson has applied a retention policy to the Exchange Online mailboxes for Contoso's warehouse users. This policy will move messages from these users' mailboxes to Contoso's archive. Since the warehouse users seldom send of receive email, their mailboxes are all 5 MB or less in size. How will this retention policy run on these mailboxes?"
    choices:
    - content: "The retention policy will run automatically once every seven days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action applies to mailboxes that are larger than 10 MB in size. Try again."
    - content: "Holly must manually run the policy using a PowerShell command"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. For mailboxes that are smaller than 10 MB, you must manually run the following PowerShell command in the Exchange Management Shell every time that you want to move messages to the archive."
    - content: "The retention policy will run automatically once every 30 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't how this retention policy will run on these mailboxes. Try again."
