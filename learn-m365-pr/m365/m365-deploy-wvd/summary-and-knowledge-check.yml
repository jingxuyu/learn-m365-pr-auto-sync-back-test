      - content: "Pooled desktop"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A pooled desktop is one of the available desktop types. Pooled desktops allow multiple user accounts to log into the same virtual machine. Pooled desktops in general are more efficient and less expensive in multi-user environments."

    - content: "You can assign users both apps and a remote desktop from the same host pool in the same app group using Windows Virtual Desktop."
      choices:
      - content: "True"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A host pool can have one app group assigned per user. App groups can have one or more apps or one remote desktop."
      - content: "False"
