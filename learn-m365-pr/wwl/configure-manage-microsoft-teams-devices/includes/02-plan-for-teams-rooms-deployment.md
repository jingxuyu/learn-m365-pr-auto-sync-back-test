The workplace of the future will be hybrid. It will be a fluid experience realized across a continuum of spaces, motivated by a personâ€™s ability to choose when and where they work. The hybrid workplace will bring increased movement between workspaces. The flow of people into the office may be inconsistent, with some days bringing more activity than others. The office will have various purposes, including:

- Access to spaces designed for productivity and collaboration.
- Reliable network connectivity.
- A destination to help separate work and life.

To ensure people working remotely can fully participate in team collaboration and meetings, workspaces in the office will need technology to help bridge the divide. Microsoft Teams Rooms addresses this need by providing a complete meeting experience to users working both in the office and remotely. It brings HD video, audio, and content sharing to meetings of all sizes, from small huddle areas to large conference rooms. Having a standard meeting configuration ensures that an organization has a simple and repeatable rollout across all its locations.

Organizations should try to standardize on procurement and have as many of the same components in as many rooms as possible. The more consistent they can be with these practices, the more efficient they'll be in supporting, implementing, and operating Teams Rooms in the future.

The following diagram displays a high-level project plan highlighting all the key milestones in a Teams Rooms deployment.

An organization will need several teams to help deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms:

- **Facilities team** - This team helps with room inventory, hanging, drilling, powering displays, and putting up signage.
- **AV team** - This team plans, configures, installs, and supports Microsoft Teams Rooms.
- **IT project team** - This team helps with network readiness and the provisioning and configuration of resource accounts. It also assists with monitoring, maintaining, and operating the Teams Rooms environment.
- **System integrators** - This team assists with some or all of these roles.

## Plan for SIP Gateway

SIP Gateway lets your organization use any compatible SIP device with Microsoft Teams to preserve your investments in SIP devices. Now you can sign-in to Teams with your corporate credentials and make and receive calls with a compatible SIP device. To find out how to configure your SIP devices for SIP Gateway, see [Configure SIP Gateway](/microsoftteams/sip-gateway-configure?azure-portal=true).

### Benefits of SIP Gateway

Using SIP Gateway, your users can do all the following:

-   **Make calls:** SIP device users can make calls to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), to other SIP devices, and to Teams and Skype for Business users.
-   **Receive calls:** SIP device users can receive a call from the PSTN, from Teams or Skype for Business users who have SIP devices, and from Teams and Skype for Business client applications.
-   **Multiple simultaneous calls:** A SIP device user in a call can put the call on hold to make or receive other calls. A SIP device user can also conference two calls.
-   **Do not disturb:** A SIP device user can set do not disturb on the device so that the device will not ring for incoming calls.
-   **Hold/Resume and Mute/Unmute:** A SIP device user can hold and resume or mute and unmute a call by using the features for those actions on the device.
-   **Voicemail:** SIP device users can listen to electronically stored voice messages that callers leave for them.
-   **Message waiting indicator:** SIP device users can receive notifications that alert them when they have new voicemail messages.
-   **Sign-in and sign-out:** SIP devices users can sign in and sign out of Teams on the device.
-   **Dual-tone multi-frequency:** SIP device users can press number keys to provide input during interactive voice response calls.
-   **Teams meetings:** A SIP device user can join a Teams meeting by dialing the meeting access number.
-   **Call transfers:** SIP device users can transfer calls. SIP Gateway supports both blind and consultative transfers.
-   **Local call forwarding:** A SIP device user can set forwarding rules (always, on timeout, and busy) for the device. If the device is connected to the SIP Gateway, then the call will be redirected to the target address based on the rule that the device user set.

## Plan your deployment

Organizations should consider the following issues when planning their Microsoft Teams Rooms deployment:

- **Set standards based on room sizes** - When possible, organizations should set standards based on the size of a room. The types of devices used should depend on the size of the room. Microsoft provides meeting room archetype specifications for different-sized meeting rooms. For details, see [Microsoft Teams devices by space](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/spaces?azure-portal=true).

- **Plan for product delays** - Unexpected things can happen, like a pandemic, which puts a slowdown on shipping and delivery schedules.

- **Standardize room installation** - An organization should develop standards for how it's going to run and organize the cables and where it's going to mount devices. If computer devices are going to be mounted behind displays, make that a standard too.

- **Understand your device setup and configuration** - Organizations must have a good understanding of the device setup instructions and any necessary configuration files.

- **Create a cabling diagram** - Where possible, an organization should create a clear, detailed cabling diagram that it can send to its remote staff. This diagram will greatly increase the Facilities team's ability to support and troubleshoot Teams Rooms.

- **Don't forget training** - As with any software deployment, it doesn't matter how great the Teams Rooms implementation is if end users aren't familiar with how to use the system. Effective, user-based training is essential to achieving user buy-in and acceptance.
