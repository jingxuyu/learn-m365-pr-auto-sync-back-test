You must understand the state of your sensitive data and how to remediate potential issues. Microsoft information protection technologies offer tools that help you gather information, learn about the state of your sensitive data, and complete your organization's information protection lifecycle.

## Microsoft 365 Defender portal

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal features capabilities for monitoring and managing security across your Microsoft identities, data, devices, apps, and infrastructure. Here you can view the security health of your organization, act to configure devices, users, and apps, and view alerts for suspicious activity. The Microsoft 365 Defender portal helps enable security admins and security operations teams to manage and protect their organization efficiently and effectively.
