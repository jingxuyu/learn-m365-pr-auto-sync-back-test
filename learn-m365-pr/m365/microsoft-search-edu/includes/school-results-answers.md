## Bookmarks and Q&As

School staff, teachers, and students can get links to popular resources and tools, and answers to common questions.

## People

Students can search for a classmate and see the classes they both attendâ€”but only if your school allows it. Teachers can view student profiles and connect with other faculty and staff.

## Files

All users signed in with their school account can search for 'my files' or 'my documents' to find their most recent files. They can also find files shared with them.

## Conversations

School users can read Microsoft Teams messages sent to them in private chats and view what others have said in public Yammer and Teams conversations.

## Sites

Users can find internal SharePoint sites they have access to.

## Acronyms

Get definitions for acronyms and abbreviations used at your school.

## Groups

Users can see groups they and others are members of and learn more about them.

## Connect to other data sources

To make even more content discoverable, admins can use connectors to index content and show results from third-party data sources. We're expanding our connectors to include the Schoology learning management system (LMS). If you're interested in configuring and using this connector, [let us know](https://forms.office.com/r/3X6rpkLQfP).
