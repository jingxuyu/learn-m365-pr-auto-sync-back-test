When it comes to file storage, you want your work to be accessible and secure. You want to be able to work with others, co-author and share files, both inside and outside your organization. **SharePoint** and **OneDrive** enable you to access, share, and collaborate on all your files from anywhere. Let’s dive deeper on how the features of SharePoint and OneDrive promote collaboration.

### SharePoint

**SharePoint,** the intelligent intranet can help you transform employee communications and digital experiences. SharePoint is a cloud-based service that helps organizations share and manage content, knowledge, and applications to empower teamwork, quickly find information, and seamlessly collaborate inside and outside the organization. It’s a rich collaboration tool for creating websites, publishing content, and storing files.

The intranet is at the core of many organizations. It's the place where employees can stay informed on company news and information, collaborate on content, and connect with colleagues. SharePoint provides three main types of sites to help you create your intranet and foster communication and collaboration across your teams and organization:

 -  **Team sites** are collaboration sites to connect you and your team to share content and resources. Team sites provide file storage and sharing, co-authoring of documents, managing lists of information, workflow integration with Power Automate and file libraries. It can also be integrated with Microsoft Teams.
 -  **Communication sites** are designed to broadcast information to other teams or to an entire organization. These sites are perfect for sharing company news, announcements, events, internal cross-company campaigns, status updates, and product launches. Use communication sites to engage and inform broad audiences.
 -  **Hub sites** are used to organize families of team sites and communication sites together. It provides a connection point and central portal for these groups of related team or communication sites. Hub sites make it easier for users to discover related content such as news and other site activities.

### OneDrive

**OneDrive** is the underlying technology that powers the collaborative files experience across Microsoft 365. OneDrive is a cloud-based service that enables you to access, share, and collaborate on files from anywhere. OneDrive lets users view files within a browser, share and find content, and sync that content so they can access it offline. You can work with others inside or outside your organization and terminate sharing whenever you want. OneDrive also empowers your organization to control, secure, and retain that content when necessary.
