    questions:
    - content: "Which of the following statements about internal penetration testing is correct?"
      choices:
      - content: "Red Team attackers target customer tenants in Microsoft 365."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Customer tenants are never the targets of internal Red Team attacks."
      - content: "The Blue Team works to detect, prevent, and respond to Red Team attacks using the security incident response process."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. This answer accurately describes Microsoft 365 internal penetration testing."
      - content: "The Blue Team attempts to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft 365 to simulate attacks by real-world attackers."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Red Team attempts to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft 365 to simulate attacks by real-world attackers."
  
    - content: "How often are vulnerability and configuration scans performed on Microsoft 365 endpoints?"
      choices:
      - content: "Weekly"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Automated vulnerability and configuration scans are conducted daily with the most recent vulnerability signatures."
      - content: "Daily"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Automated vulnerability and configuration scans are conducted daily with the most recent vulnerability signatures."
      - content: "Monthly"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Automated vulnerability and configuration scans are conducted daily with the most recent vulnerability signatures."
      
    - content: "What methods does Microsoft 365 use to detect malware?"
      choices:
      - content: "Signature-based scans and pattern-based scans"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. We use signature-based and pattern-based anti-malware scans to detect and prevent execution of both known and novel malware."
      - content: "Pattern-based scans and vulnerability scans"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Vulnerability scans are carried out by our security agent and are not related to anti-malware scanning."
