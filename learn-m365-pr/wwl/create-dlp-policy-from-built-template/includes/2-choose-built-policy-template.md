The built-in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy templates that are available in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center are designed to help organizations meet the most common legal and regulatory requirements. The following are examples of DLP templates supplied by Microsoft:

 -  **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).** Helps detect the presence of personal information for individuals inside the European Union (EU). Helps in meeting GDPR privacy obligations.
 -  **U.S. Health Insurance Act (HIPAA).** Helps detect the presence of information subject to United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
 -  **PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).** Helps detect the presence of information subject to PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), including information like credit card or debit card numbers.
 -  **United States Personally Identifiable Information (U.S. PII).** Detects information commonly considered to be personal information in the United States. Examples include taxpayer ID numbers, Social Security numbers, and passport numbers.

Before you can enforce data loss prevention, you must first create a DLP policy.

The following steps illustrate how to create a policy based on the U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data template by using the Security &amp; Compliance Center.

1.  Go to the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://sip.protection.office.com/homepage?azure-portal=true) and sign in using your work or school account.
2.  In the left-hand navigation pane, select **Data loss prevention** and then select **Policy**.<br>
3.  On the **Policy** page, select the **+Create a policy** button. This button starts the **New DLP Policy** wizard.
4.  On the **Choose the information to protect** page, select **Privacy**. In the column to the right of it, select the **U.S. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data** template from the list of pre-built Privacy templates. Select **Next**.<br><br>:::image type="content" source="../media/9.3.02b-5080117c.png":::
