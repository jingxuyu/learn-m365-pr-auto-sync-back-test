Every organization must meet requirements on how they access, retain, and use data. Microsoft Teams lets you manage compliance by defining information barriers, setting data retention policies, and establishing requirements for how your staff uses Teams. Teams supports full eDiscovery capabilities, allowing for audio log and content searches. When necessary, Teams lets you apply a legal hold on any questionable material to prevent tampering.

Suppose you're a senior administrator for Contoso and you're in charge of a new Teams deployment with around 3000 users. The board of directors has been concerned about an increase in denial-of-service attacks and data regulation breaches that have been making headlines recently. They've made you responsible for security enforcement and you want to ensure that you can comply with the new data protection regulations that have come into force in your jurisdiction.

In this module, you'll learn how to identify inappropriate content in Microsoft Teams, how to find content that relates to a legal action and hold it, and how to AppLocker to control the Teams app.
