Acronym answers help users find common definitions used within your organization. Imagine youâ€™re in a meeting and someone starts using an acronym like 'QAS' in an unfamiliar context. Use search to find definitions.

Microsoft Search can also find and surface acronym definitions in shared files and emails. These are called system-curated acronyms.

3. In the panel, enter or edit the details about the acronym and check the updated preview:

    * In the **Acronym** field, enter the acronym or abbreviation. For example, DNN.
    * In the **Stands for** field, enter the definition for the acronym. For example, deep neural network.
    * In the optional **Description** field, enter additional information about the acronym. For example, A deep neural network is a neural network with multiple levels of complexity.
