Microsoft 365 provides the following tools to address data protection and compliance:<br>

 -  Service Trust Portal
 -  Compliance Manager
 -  GDPR toolbox

### Service Trust Portal

Microsoft Service Trust Portal (STP) is a web site that provides various content and resources about:

 -  Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices.
 -  Independent third-party audit reports of Microsoft's online services.
 -  Information about how Microsoft’s online services can help your organization maintain and track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations, such as:
    
     -  **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. ISO is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.
     -  **Service Organization Controls (SOC)**. SOC is a suite of service offerings CPAs may provide. SOC is typically included along with system-level controls of a service organization or entity-level controls of other organizations.
     -  **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**. NIST is a metrology laboratory and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Its mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness.
     -  **Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)**. FedRAMP is an assessment and authorization process. U.S. federal agencies have been directed by the Office of Management and Budget to use FedRAMP to ensure security is in place when accessing cloud computing products and services.
     -  **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. GDPR is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA).

### Compliance Manager

Compliance Manager is a dashboard that provides the Compliance Score and a summary of an organization’s data protection and compliance stature. It also includes recommendations to improve data protection and compliance.

Compliance Manager provides an organization with a complete view of its data protection and compliance posture when using Microsoft cloud services. Compliance Manager helps organizations conduct risk assessments. It also simplifies their compliance processes by providing recommended actions, evidence gathering, and audit preparedness.

> [!TIP]
> Compliance Manager is accessed through the Service Trust Portal. Compliance Score shares the same backend with Compliance Manager, so any data you may already have in Compliance Manager will show in Compliance Score. It's recommended that organizations begin all their compliance management activities in Compliance Score, since all this compliance functionality is being consolidated there.

### GDPR toolbox

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was developed to create cohesive data privacy laws that serve to protect the personal data of all European Union (EU) citizens. Any organization that offers goods or services to, or monitors the behavior of, EU citizens, is impacted by the GDPR.

The GDPR gives individuals in the EU (known data subjects) the right to access, retrieve, correct, erase, and restrict processing of their personal data. Under the GDPR, personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. To help organizations observe these rights, Microsoft 365 provides tools and guidance that can be broken down into four recommended steps: Discover, Govern, Protect, and Monitor and Respond. These steps are displayed in the following diagram.

GDPR contains requirements around how personal data is collected, stored, processed, and deleted for EU citizens. To support this effort, Microsoft 365 provides the GDPR toolbox to help discover, govern, protect, and monitor the personal data in an organization's Microsoft 365 tenant.

The toolbox doesn't include new tools. Instead, it’s a collection of tools and guidance available in the Security and Compliance Center to provide a central access for GDPR cases.

You can access the GDPR Toolbox in the Security &amp; Compliance portal by navigating to **Data Privacy** on the GDPR dashboard.

**Additional reading.** For more information about GDPR, see [General Data Protection Regulation Summary](/microsoft-365/compliance/gdpr).
