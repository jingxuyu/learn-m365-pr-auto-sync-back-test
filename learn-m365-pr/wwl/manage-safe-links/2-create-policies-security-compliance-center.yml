quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Allan Deyoung wants to implement Safe Links in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. Allan prefers to use the Security and Compliance Center rather than PowerShell to implement Safe Links. Using the SCC, what must Allan do to get Safe Links scanning of URLs at Lucerne Publishing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a Safe Links rule"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When you create a Safe Links policy in the SCC, you're actually creating a safe links rule and the associated safe links policy at the same time using the same name for both. You don't create a Safe Links rule separately from the Safe Links policy. Try again."
    - content: "Enable the ATP Safe Links option in the org-wide settings page of the SCC"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. No such setting exists. Try again."
    - content: "Create at least one Safe Links policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To get Safe Links scanning of URLs, you must create one or more Safe Links policies."
