quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso has a hybrid Exchange environment. Some user mailboxes are in Contoso's on-premises Exchange Server, while other user mailboxes are in Exchange Online. As the Messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is trying to determine why messages that are sent between on-premises users don't have DLP policies applied. Which of the following items is the cause of this problem?"
    choices:
    - content: "In a hybrid environment, DLP policies are only applied in Exchange Server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item doesn't correctly explain this situation. Try again."
    - content: "In a hybrid environment, document fingerprinting is not available in Exchange Server"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item doesn't correctly explain this situation. Incidentally, document fingerprinting is available in Exchange Server, but it isn't available in Exchange Online. Try again."
    - content: "In a hybrid environment, DLP policies are only applied in Exchange Online"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In hybrid environments where some mailboxes are in on-premises Exchange Server and some are in Exchange Online, DLP policies are only applied in Exchange Online. Messages that are sent between on-premises users don't have DLP policies applied because the messages don't leave the on-premises environment."
