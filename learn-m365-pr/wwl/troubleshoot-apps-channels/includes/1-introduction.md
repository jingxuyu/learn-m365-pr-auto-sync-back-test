You work for an enterprise-level organization. Microsoft Teams is used throughout the organization to allow people to organize their work and interact with their colleagues. In particular, channels and apps are used to sub-divide work and allow specialists to work together. 
Most teams have added one or more channels to focus on specific tasks. This is where people chat, hold meetings, share files, and add apps to improve their productivity. When users have problems with channels, or working with apps, their efficiency is reduced. 

In this module you will learn how to troubleshoot the issues that arise in public and private channels, including working with apps. You will learn how to configure and validate app permission policies, and setup policies. You will also learn how to define permissions and policies for public and private channels.

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Describe how to troubleshoot app issues in channels.

- Understand how to troubleshoot private and public channels.
