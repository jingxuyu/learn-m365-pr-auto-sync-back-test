Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is often used to protect Microsoft apps and services such as Office 365 and Azure, but Defender for Cloud Apps threat detection policies can also be used for non-Microsoft cloud apps.

Defender for Cloud Apps uses APIs from the cloud provider to have visibility and control of the non-Microsoft services. Because these APIs are provided by the cloud provider, the capabilities of each API can differ, and the time taken to perform tasks such as scanning all files might take hours or days.

When a connection is made to a cloud app provider, Defender for Cloud Apps will scan users, files, and activities. After this initial scan, Defender for Cloud Apps periodically scans users, groups, activities, and files.Â Once a connection is made, you can create Defender for Cloud Apps policies.
