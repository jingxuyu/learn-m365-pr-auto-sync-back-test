The Contoso Electronics accounting team was spending too much time manually processing POs. They must open each PO in order to gather essential information such as the PO number and the PO total. As the process takes longer, the accounting team often feels rushed, resulting in gathering incorrect information from the POs, which causes issues for the operations team and ultimately the entire business process.

With SharePoint Syntex form processing models, you could support the accounting team in intelligently processing the POs using Power Apps AI Builder. By training the model with a set of documents that both fit the form type and did not, and setting the appropriate fields to capture information from, the accounting team now has a dedicated document library for extracting the data they need from each PO. All the information they need is displayed clearly in the document library, eliminating the error-prone manual process their team previously used.  

Applying this automated and intelligent solution to a document library allows businesses to easily organize the forms that their operations depend on. Eliminating the manual retrieval of data from forms not only ensures greater accuracy and quicker time to insight, it also frees up time for business units to focus on more value-additive initiatives that grow overall business success.
