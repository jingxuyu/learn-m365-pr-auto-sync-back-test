The most valuable thing an event attendee shares with you is their time.

The most successful virtual events are part of a long-term audience acquisition and retention strategy.

Ensure attendee satisfaction with valuable and engaging content and on-screen talent. Clear calls to action and post-event engagement help ensure the attendees you acquire return for future events.

- **Awareness**: How will you make your attendees aware your event is happening? What's the core message you want to deliver?
- **Education**: Inform potential attendees about why they should attend, and what they'll gain from attendance. How will you engage with people?
- **Intent**: Once they're aware and know why they should attend, people need to act on their intent to attend.
- **Conversion**: Converting people from *possible* to *registered* attendees. Reduce friction in the sign-up process. As you register attendees and gather information about their preferences, begin to build or adapt your content with a focus on your specific attendees.
- **Engagement**: During the event, provide multiple ways for your attendees to engage with the content. Have you trained your presenters and moderators on all the tools they need to succeed?
- **Satisfaction**: If your event is a success, attendees will be satisfied and, hopefully, recommend future events to others. What was your audience profile, and can you gather metrics on their diversity?
