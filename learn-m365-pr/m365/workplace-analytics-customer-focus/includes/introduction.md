The success of any business can largely be attributed to the attention it gives to customers, partners, and other external parties. In today's world, customer expectations are constantly evolving and growing. Taking the time to understand customer needs, improve products, and foster long-term relationships is more important than ever. With Workplace Analytics, you can gain insights into collaboration related to customer focus and uncover specific patterns that can lead to improved customer focus and sales success.

Imagine you are leading a Sales analytics team. Sales leaders want to understand how employees spend time with key accounts and if that time has been effective. They want to use collaboration data to come up with strategies that improve sales effectiveness, enhance sales performance, and more easily reach sales targets. To date, information about sales effectiveness has come from sales data based on accounts, contacts, and revenue, rather than real-time collaboration activities.

You know that Microsoft 365 collaboration metrics can be measured with Workplace Analytics data and that you can integrate it with sales-related outcome data as well as account and contact information from your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database. You can use Workplace Analytics to build a customer focus analysis that brings collaboration into the equation to help your sales leaders make informed decisions that improve sales effectiveness.
