The transition to modern management is a journey, and an organization's existing infrastructure and goals will determine what steps are needed. Existing Configuration Manager customers can leverage Co-manangment to contiue to leverage thier existing investment, while migrating certain workloads to Microsoft Intune. While some customers may choose to, the goal does not have to be moving all workloads to cloud-based solutions. On-premesis and cloud technologies each have thier advantages, and administrators should choose which works best for them. As organizations transition to modern managment, in addition to transitioning client management methods, administrators should also consider implimenting solutions such as Known Folder Move to migrate user data files to the cloud.
