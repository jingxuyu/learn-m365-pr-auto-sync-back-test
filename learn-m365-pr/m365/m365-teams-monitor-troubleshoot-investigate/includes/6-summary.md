In this module, you discovered how to monitor call quality using call analytics and the Call Quality Dashboard. You saw how to prioritize network traffic using Quality of Service. You also learned about the three types of logs for Microsoft Teams: debug log, media log, and the desktop log.

You've seen the reports available from both the Microsoft 365 admin center, and the Teams admin center. You viewed the usage and device data, live event data, and PSTN usage data.

With all this information, you can now answer whether there's call quality issues in your company, and you've got access to tools to help diagnose and resolve them.

Now you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Monitor the quality of Teams calls and meetings, and diagnose and eliminate the ones with poor sound or unreliable connections.
- Diagnose common problems in Teams by using logs.
