Role based access control simplifies how administrators grant users access to resources. Roles are collections of permissions that define which actions can be performed. Users and groups are associated with these roles, that ultimately grant the necessary permissions for a user to perform a function. Users can be assigned to a group explicitly, or they can be assigned to a group automatically based on defined criteria. Users can be managed using the Azure portal, or they can be managed using command-line interfaces such as Windows PowerShell. AD DS and Azure AD can be synchronized use the Azure AD Connect tool to eliminate the need to update both directories when making a change.
