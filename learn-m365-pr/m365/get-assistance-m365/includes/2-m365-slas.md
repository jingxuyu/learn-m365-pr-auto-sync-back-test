As with any cloud-based service offering, Microsoft 365 subscriptions come with a guaranteed amount of uptime in terms of a percentage of service availability over a given period, such as a 99 percent available uptime average over the period of one year. The details of the guarantee are stipulated in a legal agreement between a cloud service provider and the customer, known as a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The details of a SLA vary from one cloud service provider to another. 

In addition to your CSPâ€™s SLA, Microsoft offers Microsoft 365 subscribers a Microsoft Online Services Agreement that provides financial backing to our commitment to achieve and maintain the service levels for each service.
