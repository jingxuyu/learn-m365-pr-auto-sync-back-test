The Automatic Updates feature in Windows Update downloads and installs important updates, including feature upgrades, servicing upgrades, security updates, and critical performance updates. Windows 10 devices receive all updates automatically from Windows Update. The time that it takes to install updates depends on the configuration options that you select. Most updates occur seamlessly, with the following exceptions:

- If an update requires a restart to complete installation, you can schedule the restart for a specific time.

- When a software update is applied to an application that is in use, Windows 10 can save the application’s data, then close, update, and restart the application. Windows 10 might prompt the user to accept Microsoft Software License Terms when the application restarts.

- When you configure Windows Update, consider the following:

  - Use WSUS in a corporate environment.

  - Use Configuration Manager for larger environments that have more than 100 computers.

The recommended settings are set to download and install updates automatically. By using the recommended settings, users don’t need to search for critical updates or worry that critical fixes might be missing from their computers.

## Update delivery

In Windows 10, devices download updates directly from Windows Update by default. Windows 10 devices also can download updates from other devices that already have the updates downloaded using a peer-to-peer method. You can turn off peer-to-peer delivery in Advanced Options in Windows Update. You can configure the device to download updates from other devices on the local network, or from both the local network and the Internet.

## Windows Update settings in Windows 10

To configure Windows Update settings on a local computer, open Settings. Click **Update &amp; Security**, and then click **Windows Update**. On the Windows Update tab, you can use the Update status and Update settings sections to configure and control Windows Update.
