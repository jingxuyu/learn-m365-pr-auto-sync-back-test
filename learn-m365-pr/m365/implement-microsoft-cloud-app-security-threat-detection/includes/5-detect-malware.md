You can use Cloud App Security to detect Malware in your cloud apps. Cloud App Security integrates with Microsoft's Threat Intelligence engine to enable this capability. You don't need to configure anything in order to use malware detection; a threat detection policy called Malware detection exists by default.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This built-in policy is disabled by default.

Malware detection in Cloud App Security is able to detect malware in the following apps:

- Box
- Dropbox
- Google Workspace
- Office 365

> [!NOTE]
> For Office 365, you'll require a valid license for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P1.

1. Open the Cloud App Security portal and navigate to the **Policies** node.
2. Select the Actions button for the **Malware detection (Disabled)** policy.
3. Select **Enable**.
4. In the **Confirm enable** dialog box, select **Enable policy**.

If you want to review or edit the settings for the policy, select the **Actions** button and then select **Edit policy**. You can then configure the following settings:
