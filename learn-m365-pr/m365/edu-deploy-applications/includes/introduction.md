The school classroom has evolved from the traditional environment where  the teacher talking at their students and presenting content with chalkboards and overheads, to a more engaged and interactive experience where students make use of tablets and computers to enhance their day-to-day learning. Since 2017, Microsoft has been working with and supporting school IT departments, faculties, and students to provide a richer learning experience.

Suppose you work in your school's IT department. You want to use Intune for Education to deploy applications to teachers, administrators, and students in your school. You're planning to deploy applications from the Microsoft Store for Education and you'll be deploying both win32 and iOS apps. Some of these apps will be free while others will be paid-for apps.

In this module, you'll explore different technology options offered by Microsoft including the deployment of applications from Microsoft Store for Education and the use of Intune for Education to manage groups and app deployment.
