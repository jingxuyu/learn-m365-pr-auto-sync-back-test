Getting started with OKRs requires an understanding of the components of the OKR framework.

### Definitions

OKRs have three components: Objectives, Key Results, and Key Initiatives/Projects.

**Objectives** are the goal you want to achieve. They ask, "Where do we want to go?" and the answers are **actionable**, **aspirational**, and **meaningful**.

**Key Results** are how you measure if you're successful. They ask, "How will we know we're getting there?" and the answers are **focused**, **measurable**, and **ambitious**. Key Results are OUTCOMES.

**Key Initiatives/Projects** are focused efforts that help you achieve your Key Results. They ask, "What do we have to do to get there?" and the answers result in a list of tasks.

### Framework

Objectives begin at the Organization level, generally with 3-5 annual goals that steer the direction of the company. Each Objective is usually supported by 3-5 Key Results.

From there, goals are broken down into a more manageable time period, such as quarters or semesters, and cascade down to departments or teams.

Key Initiatives/Projects are added on an as-needed basis to support the work that needs to be completed.

### History

OKRs have a long history that can be traced back to 1954 when Peter Drucker developed a strategic planning process called Management by Objectives (MBO). Decades later, Andy Grove (former CEO at Intel) built upon this foundation to create the OKR framework. In the 1980s, Intel and Motorola were locked in a "life-threatening competitive challenge" to determine who would be the dominant chipmaker for computers of the future.

In response, Grove used the OKR method to rally the entire company around this common purpose, and at one point, Intel had 1,000 employees all focused on this one singular goal.  

The result? The strategy worked, Intel prevailed, and secured 85% of the market.

More significantly, the OKR framework gained credibility as a powerful method for aligning businesses to achieve ambitious goals.
