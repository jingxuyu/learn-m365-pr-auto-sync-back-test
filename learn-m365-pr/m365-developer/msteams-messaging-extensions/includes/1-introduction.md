Users can interact with your Microsoft Teams apps though buttons and forms in the Microsoft Teams client. Messaging extensions enable users to execute search queries or trigger actions in external systems. The results of these actions are sent from your custom web service to the Microsoft Teams client as embedded web pages or richly formatted cards.

In this module, you'll learn how to create different types of messaging extensions in a custom Microsoft Teams app.
