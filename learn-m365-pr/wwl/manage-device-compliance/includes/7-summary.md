This module examined how organizations manage device compliance. Many companies define how their devices should be configured. The following items are examples of compliance policies that organizations often use:

 -  All devices require a password or PIN.
 -  Devices should have local data encrypted.
 -  Devices should all run Windows 10.
 -  Access to company resources should be limited to just those devices that have been configured in this manner.
 -  Notify management of any devices that aren't configured in an expected way.

This module explored device compliance policies and how organizations effectively use them. If an organization's devices are managed by Intune, the organization can define how devices should be configured by using device compliance policies. After configuring and deploying a compliance policy, an organization can monitor device compliance status. It can also identify individual devices and information if they're configured in an expected way. Compliance policies are platform-specific. You can have multiple compliance policies that verify the same setting, but on different device types, such as Android and Windows 10.

You learned that organizations can also use device compliance status for reporting. For example, reports can be generated that show which Windows 10 devices are using BitLocker or donâ€™t have Windows Firewall enabled, and how many devices fall in these categories. Compliance information can also be used as one of criteria for conditional access. You can require that users only access email and other company resources from compliant devices.

In this module, you learned how to create policies and configure conditional users and groups to which whose policies will be applied. You also examined how to manage devices once they're enrolled to MDM. Managing devices includes monitoring them, verifying whether they're compliant, and generating various reports on the Intune view in the Azure portal or by using Power BI and the Intune data warehouse.
