Microsoft Teams Rooms scale to different room sizes. Teams Rooms use a wide variety of certified audio and video peripherals based on the size and use of the room. By selecting the right core device and console, combined with microphones, speakers, cameras, and displays appropriate for the space, an organization can deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms into spaces of any size - from small huddle spaces up through large conference spaces and boardrooms.

## Analyze spaces for Teams Rooms

The Teams administrator must collaborate with the IT Project team and the AV team to analyze spaces for Teams Rooms. This collaboration should determine:

- Which Microsoft Teams Rooms solution is the most suitable for each room based on the future plans for the room.
- Which AV peripheral devices are the best fit, depending on room size and layout.  

Questions that should be asked when designing meeting spaces for Teams Rooms include:

* What type of furniture is in the room?
* What type of materials are on the walls in the room?
* Are the walls made of glass?
* How bright or dark is the room?
* How large is the room?
* What kind of field of view should the camera have?
* How are you going to run cables to the table microphones, cameras, and displays?

## Document your meeting spaces

Organizations should address the following questions when reviewing current or potential meeting rooms and spaces:

* What is the goal of this room?
* Will cables need to be run on top of the floor?
* Is there a physical whiteboard?
* Does the room have any noticeable ambient noise issues, such as a loud air conditioning unit?
* Do you need to control external devices such as lowering shades or turning on a projector?
* Can the walls support the display weight?

Before reviewing each meeting room and space, it's important to obtain the dimensions of each room from the facilities team. Cameras, microphones, and speakers all have documented ranges for optimal performance. With these measurements, an organization can be certain that it's purchased the right audio and video equipment for a given space.

Once you have all the dimensions, you can work with your Teams Rooms vendor to validate the right equipment is being chosen for the right space. The following chart is a sample Microsoft Teams Rooms deployment template:
