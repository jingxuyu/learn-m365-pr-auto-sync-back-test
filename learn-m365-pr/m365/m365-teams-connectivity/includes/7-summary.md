In your large multi-national bicycle manufacturer, you were responsible for assessing and rearchitecting network components to ensure that performance was optimal when you migrated to using Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams. You started by reconfiguring the security components to conform to Microsoft 365 networking principles. For example, you identified and differentiated traffic to and from Microsoft 365 and made sure it egressed locally, and avoided network hairpins. You worked with your security team to implement a Zero Trust security model, so that these optimizations did not result in security loopholes. Finally, you made network optimization that specifically helps Microsoft Teams performance.

Microsoft Teams is a cloud solution and meetings are served from locations that are physically distant to your users. If you carefully assess and configure your network as you've learned in this module, you'll optimize your network's performance and ensure users enjoy a good experience.

Having completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the networking principles that create optimal performance in Microsoft 365 and Teams, when architects follow them.
- Design your local network to ensure fast communications with Microsoft 365.
- Describe how to optimize network security by implementing Zero Trust principles.
- Demonstrate how to ensure that Teams meetings work well for users.
