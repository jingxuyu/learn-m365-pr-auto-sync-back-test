Your company wanted to effectively deploy and measure the impact of a series of initiatives designed to streamline ways of working, reduce burnout risk and boost manager effectiveness. To do this, you needed data tracking employees’ work behaviors and collaboration patterns at a granular level and on a continuous basis.  

By using the Workplace Analytics Collaboration Assessment dashboard, you were able to surface the insights you needed, enabling your CHRO to understand how long and through what modes people across your company collaborate, to identify pockets of burnout risk, and to see trends in manager coaching. With this data, your CHRO can sequence and prioritize transformation initiatives based on need, focus interventions on the employee groups who will benefit the most, and continuously test and refine programs during the company-wide roll-out. 

Without the Workplace Analytics Collaboration Assessment tool, you would have needed to directly access your company’s collaboration data, de-identify and clean it, and join it with your HR/organizational data, potentially taking weeks or months of your time. 

The Collaboration Assessment helped you quantify the impact of your company’s cultural transformation and recommend measurable changes that boost employee engagement, increase productivity, and unlock more agile ways of working, saving valuable time for people across the entire organization. 


Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Describe what the Collaboration Assessment is. 
- Set up the Power BI template. 
- Evaluate collaboration culture and employee experience using the Power BI template.
