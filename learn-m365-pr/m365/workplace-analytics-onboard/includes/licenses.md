As the person responsible for deploying Workplace Analytics at your company, you should work with the sponsor to determine which users to include in the analysis population. This is the group of employees whose digital collaboration patterns the company wants to evaluate.

The Office 365 tenant administrator can use group-based licensing or Windows PowerShell to assign these licenses.

It's important to note that assigning a Workplace Analytics license to a mailbox does not change the employee's day-to-day experience.
