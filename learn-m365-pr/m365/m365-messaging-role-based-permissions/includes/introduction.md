You work as an Exchange Server administrator for a clothing manufacturer. One of your department managers suspects some of their users are abusing the mail service - they may be sending inappropriate messages or sharing confidential documents. At the same time, the team responsible for security and compliance asked you to explore whether they can use role-based access control as part of their ongoing eDiscovery work. 

By the end of this module, you'll be able to do the following: 

- Explain role groups
- Explain admin roles
- Manage user roles
- Explain Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Describe RBAC for eDiscovery
