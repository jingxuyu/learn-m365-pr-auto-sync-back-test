In this lesson, we discussed how companies can work purely in the cloud or connect existing on-premises systems to the cloud to extend the value of their legacy infrastructure. Then we looked at how these two different service models require different approaches to migration and reviewed a few scenarios that demonstrate when an organization might opt for one type of migration over the other. Finally, we reviewed some considerations for how an organization approaches migrating systems with older versions of Windows, Office Server, and Office to Microsoft 365.
