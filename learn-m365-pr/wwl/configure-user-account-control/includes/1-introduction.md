Many users sign in to their computers with a user account that has more rights than are necessary to run their applications and access their data files. Using an administrative user account for day-to-day user tasks poses significant security risks. In older versions of the Windows operating system, administrators were encouraged to use an ordinary user account for most tasks, and to use the Run As account to enact tasks that required additional rights.

Windows provides UAC to simplify and help secure the process of elevating your account rights. However, unless you know how UAC works, and how it can affect your users, you might have problems when you attempt to carry out typical end-user support tasks. This module introduces how User Account Control works and how you can use UAC-related desktop features to reduce security risks.

## Module objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

 -  Describe User Account Control (UAC).
 -  Explain how UAC works.
 -  Explain how to configure UAC notification settings.
