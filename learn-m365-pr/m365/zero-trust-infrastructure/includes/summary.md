Infrastructure is a broad term that covers all hardware, software, servers, networks, facilities, and much more. The Zero Trust model leverages industry guidance to allow you to better secure your infrastructure and reduce cyberattacks. By implementing robust monitoring and alerting tools across your infrastructure, you can be alerted to breaches, spot unusual behaviors, find and patch vulnerabilities, and prevent attacks. By applying just-in-time access to administrative functions and virtual environments, you can reduce or limit the scope and scale of an attack. By hardening the devices and endpoints in your IT infrastructure landscape, you reduce the chance of a successful cyberattack.

Now that youâ€™ve completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the threat vectors associated with your infrastructure.
- Describe how configuration management can improve your infrastructure.
- Describe how monitoring your infrastructure can identify possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
