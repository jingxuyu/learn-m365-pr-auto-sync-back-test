quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the enterprise administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is considering whether to create both a device configuration policy and an endpoint detection and response policy to manage the same device setting - in this case, onboarding devices to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. What could happen if Holly creates these policies?"
    choices:
    - content: "Fabrikam's devices will report their risk levels to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action occurs when an organization deploys Intune's onboarding configuration package from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to its Windows devices."
    - content: "Fabrikam could end up with policy conflicts for devices"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Some organizations use multiple policies or policy types to manage the same device settings (such as onboarding to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint). For example, they may use both a device configuration policy and an endpoint detection and response policy. This practice can result in policy conflicts for devices."
    - content: "Device threat levels will be assessed, and devices that donâ€™t meet an acceptable level will either be blocked or selectively wiped."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action occurs if you create an app protection policy for any protected app."
