Across your organization, you probably have different types of content that require different actions taken on them in order to comply with industry regulations and internal policies. For example, you might have:
  
- Tax forms that need to be **retained** for a minimum period of time. 
    
- Press materials that need to be **permanently deleted** when they reach a certain age. 
    
- Competitive research that needs to be both **retained** and then **permanently deleted**. 
    
- Work visas that must be **marked as a record** so that they can't be edited or deleted. 
    
In all of these cases, retention labels in Office 365 can help you take the right actions on the right content. With retention labels, you can classify data across your organization for governance, and enforce retention rules based on that classification.
  
With retention labels, you can:
  
- **Enable people in your organization to apply a retention label manually** to content in Outlook on the web, Outlook 2010 and later, OneDrive, SharePoint, and Office 365 groups. Users often know best what type of content they're working with, so they can classify it and have the appropriate policy applied. 
    
- **Apply retention labels to content automatically** if it matches specific conditions, such as when the content contains: 
    
  - Specific types of sensitive information.
    
  - Specific keywords that match a query you create.
    
    The ability to apply retention labels to content automatically is important because:
    
  - You don't need to train your users on all of your classifications.
    
  - You don't need to rely on users to classify all content correctly.
    
  - Users no longer need to know about data governance policies - they can instead focus on their work.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The capability to apply labels automatically requires an Office 365 Enterprise E5 license for each user who has permissions to edit content that's been automatically labeled in a site or mailbox. Users who simply have read-only access do not require a license.
      
- **Apply a default retention label to a document library** in SharePoint and Office 365 group sites, so that all documents in that library get the default retention label. 
    
- **Implement records management across Office 365**, including both email and documents. You can use a retention label to classify content as a record. When this happens, the label can't be changed or removed, and the content can't be edited or deleted. 
    
You create and manage retention labels on the **Retention** tab on the **Labels** page in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center.

## How retention labels work with label policies

Making retention labels available to people in your organization so that they can classify content is a two-step process: first you create the labels, and then you publish them to the locations you choose. When you publish retention labels, a label policy gets created.
