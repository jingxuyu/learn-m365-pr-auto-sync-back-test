Today, we rely on cloud applications more than ever, both in our personal lives and at work. A typical member of an organization uses many different cloud applications to carry out their daily tasks. For example, they might use separate apps to check emails, send messages, and make calls. A user can now run an app on one device, like their laptop, and then run the same app on a different device, such as their smartphone, and pick up right where they left off. 

However, this means that, if a single app is compromised, the device, the user, and the organization as a whole could be at risk. This is why it's critical to protect all cloud apps, regardless of their purpose or scope.

Let's look at applications in the Zero Trust journey.

Remember that Zero Trust requires you to apply the following security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach

To protect the organization and its users, all apps must adhere to these principles.

In this module, you'll learn about cloud applications and get an introduction to the concept of shadow IT and its impact. You'll also see how to use the Zero Trust approach to protect applications.
