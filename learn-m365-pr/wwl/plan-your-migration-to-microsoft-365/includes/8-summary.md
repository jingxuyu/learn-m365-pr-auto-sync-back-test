Microsoft 365 Enterprise is the integrated combination of Office 365 Enterprise, Windows 10 Enterprise, and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS). Its goal is to help organizations realize the [Modern Workplace](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2018/04/27/making-it-simpler-with-a-modern-workplace/?azure-portal=true), in which they can enjoy a secure and highly reliable environment for exchanging ideas, having conversations, collaborating, and doing their best work.

Deploying these three products in an integrated way to maximize the security and productivity benefits can be a challenge, especially when you're not a subject matter expert in all three. When you move an enterprise organization to Microsoft 365, it's important to plan exactly what steps you want to take, when to do them, and who will do them. To ensure you make this move correctly and have confidence in the final configuration, Microsoft provides the Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365. This checklist guides you through the planning and deployment process.
