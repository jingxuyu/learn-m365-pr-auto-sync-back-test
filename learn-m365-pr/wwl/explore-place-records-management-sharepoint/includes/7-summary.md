This module introduced you to archiving in SharePoint, which is referred to as In-Place Records Management. There are two forms of archiving in SharePoint:

 -  You can either manage records in place, which means that you can leave a document in its current location on a site.
 -  You can classify documents as records and store them in a specific archive, such as a Records Center site.

The module introduced you to creating a file plan, which is an organization's planning document for records management. You learned that file plans typically summarize the following information:

 -  A description of the types of items the organization decides are records.
 -  Definitions for the broader category of records the items belong to.
 -  Locations where records are stored.
 -  Retention periods for records.
 -  The person(s) responsible for managing the various kinds of records.

In SharePoint, archiving begins with the declaration of selected documents as records. A record is a document that requires retention for a chosen time period. Managing records in SharePoint is accomplished by using Records Management. In this module, you learned how to plan for Records Management in SharePoint and how to convert active documents to records. Records Management is designed to archive data that's no longer needed in day to day SharePoint operations. Records management enables you to control content in collaborative spaces.

This module also showed how records aren't limited to just documents. In fact, certain SharePoint features, such as blogs, wikis, web pages, and list items, can be declared as records. An in-place records management system can prevent these records from being deleted or edited based upon your organization's definition of what a record is.

The module concluded by showing you how to configure In-Place Records Management. You learned that to configure In-Place Records Management, you need to complete the following tasks:

 -  Activate in-place records management at the site collection level.
 -  Configure record declaration settings at the site collection level.
 -  Configure record declaration settings at the list or library level.
