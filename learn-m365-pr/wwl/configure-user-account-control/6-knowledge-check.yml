    choices:

    choices:
    - content: "A program that isn't part of Windows needs your permission to start"
      isCorrect: false

If this type of dialog box displays, it usually is safe to continue. If you are unsure, check the name of the program or function to decide if it is something that you want to run."
  - content: "As the Desktop Administrator for Fabrikam, you are a local administrator on your Windows 11 computer. When you attempted to install a new application on your computer, you received a UAC prompt that asked for permission to complete the task. You granted the permission, at which time the task was performed by using full administrative rights. What happened next?"
