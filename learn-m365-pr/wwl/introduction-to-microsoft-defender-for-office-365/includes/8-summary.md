This module examined how Microsoft Defender for Office 365 extends the email protection provided by Exchange Online Protection (EOP). It does so by filtering targeted attacks that could pass through EOPâ€™s line of defenses. These attacks include:<br>

 -  advanced threats such as zero-day attacks in email attachments and Office documents.
 -  time-of-selection protection against malicious URLs.

When integrated together, EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 represent the anti-malware pipeline in Microsoft 365. These products provide the most efficient level of protection against commodity and advanced targeted threats.

This module focused on two primary products within Microsoft Defender for Office 365: Safe Attachments and Safe Links.<br>

 -  Safe Attachments blocks zero-day malware in email attachments and documents.
 -  Safe Links protects users from malicious URLs embedded in email and documents that point to malicious websites.

Within Safe Links, you learned how URL Detonation combines elements of Safe Links and Safe Attachments into a single feature. This feature protects users in the event a link points to a malicious file on a web server.
