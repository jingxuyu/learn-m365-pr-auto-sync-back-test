This module introduced you to Edge Transport servers. These servers handle all inbound and outbound Internet mail flow by providing mail relay and smart host services for organizations running Microsoft Exchange Server.

In this module, you learned how Edge Transport servers help prevent spam messages from reaching your organizationâ€™s users. It does so by using a collection of agents that provide different layers of spam filtering and virus protection. These agents provide protection against spam and apply transport rules to control mail flow. You learned that all these features work together to help minimize the exposure of an organization's internal Exchange environment to threats from the Internet.

In this module, you also learned about the key features that a Messaging Administrator should plan for when implementing Edge Transport servers. These features include the infrastructure requirements and EdgeSync.
