Your *attack surface* is of all the points where an attacker could compromise your organization's devices, servers, or networks.

Imagine that you're a security analyst for a medium-sized organization. You're concerned that attackers can target your organization's IT environment from many different places across your devices and network. One preemptive approach that you could take to threats is to reduce the attack surface  that malicious actors could exploit. The smaller the attack surface, the more difficult it is for attackers to penetrate your defenses. 

In this module, you'll learn how Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can help you to reduce your attack surface.
