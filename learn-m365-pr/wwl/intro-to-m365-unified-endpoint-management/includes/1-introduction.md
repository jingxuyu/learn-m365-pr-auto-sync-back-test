Today's technology is changing the way we all work. Digital transformations enable the flexibility to work from anywhere, on any device. That flexibility doesn't mean, however, that you're not responsible for the security of your organization's data, no matter where it lives. Modern workplaces demand a new approach to managing and securing data and devices, alongside seamless interactions between the productivity tools you rely on.

**Unified endpoint management** is a concept that describes a platform that includes device and app management. Microsoft Intune and Endpoint Configuration Manager (Configuration Manager), part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM), help simplify modern workplace management. Use them to create a productive Microsoft 365 environment where your users can work on the devices and apps they choose, while still protecting your org's data.

In the next unit, we'll examine some of the mobile device management challenges encountered in today's workplace.
