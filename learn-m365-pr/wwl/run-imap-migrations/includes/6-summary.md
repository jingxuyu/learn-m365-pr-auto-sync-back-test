Messaging systems that aren't based on Microsoft Exchange Server commonly use the IMAP protocol to communicate with their messaging clients. As such, the IMAP protocol is an important factor when considering migrations to Exchange Online.

This module examined the requirements for running an IMAP migration. It analyzed the migration options that are available, and the steps that are completed during a migration.

You learned that an IMAP migration migrates emails and the folder structure. However, it doesn't migrate any other objects, such as calendar items or contacts.

You also learned that two things are needed to migrate the contents of users' mailboxes from an IMAP messaging system to their Exchange Online mailboxes:

 -  A CSV file that lists all the mailboxes to be migrated.
 -  The IMAP Migration wizard thatâ€™s located in the Exchange Admin Center.

The module concluded by analyzing the steps involved in migrating mailboxes in an IMAP migration.
