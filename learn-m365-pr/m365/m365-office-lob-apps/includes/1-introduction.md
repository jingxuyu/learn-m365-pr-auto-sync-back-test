Windows 10 includes a range of applications, from system apps that support the operating system to *provisioned* apps that are installed the first time your users run Windows.

The following types of apps run on Windows 10:

- **Windows apps.** There are two categories of Windows apps:
  - System apps. Apps that are installed in the C:\Windows directory. These apps are integral to the OS.
  - Other apps. Apps that are installed in C:\Program Files\WindowsApps. There are two classes of these other apps:
    - Provisioned: Installed in a new user account the first time the user signs in.
    - Installed: Installed as part of the OS.
- **Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.** These apps are designed to work and be installed on multiple platforms including Windows client, Windows Phone, and Xbox. All UWP apps are also Windows apps, but not all Windows apps are UWP apps.
- **"Win32" apps.** These apps are traditional Windows applications.

While some applications are only available as either a 32-bit or 64-bit compiled version, others such as Office 365 ProPlus offer both 32-bit and 64-bit native compiled code. To take advantage of additional computing power and RAM on new devices, use the 64-bit version as long as you don’t have 32-bit dependencies (discovered during the device and app readiness step). The 64-bit versions of all apps, including Microsoft Office, offer the best performance and are the most future-proof choice. 

In this module, we’ll look at several methods and models for installing Office and business applications.
