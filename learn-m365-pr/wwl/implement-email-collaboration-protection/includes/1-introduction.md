In earlier training, you learned how Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides email and collaboration protection through features such as Safe Attachments, Safe Links, and Zero-hour auto purge. In this module, you'll examine other threat protection features provided by Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

The module begins with an introduction to the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protection stack. You'll learn about the four layers in this stack, and the protection that each provides.

You'll then examine several threat intelligence features in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. These features include Threat Explorer, Threat Trackers, and Attack simulation training. Threat Explorer and Threat Trackers provide admins with evidence-based knowledge and actionable advice. Admins can use this information to make informed decisions about protecting and responding to cyber-attacks against their tenant.

You'll then be introduced to Attack simulation training. This training feature provides realistic attack scenarios to help organizations identify vulnerable users before a real attack happens. The goal of Attack simulation training is two-part:

 -  To make employees aware of various threat attacks.
 -  To change employee behavior, so they learn what not to do when receiving email with links and attachments and so on.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the protection stack provided by Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
 -  Understand how Threat Explorer can be used to investigate threats and help to protect your tenant.
 -  Describe the Threat Tracker widgets and views that provide you with intelligence on different cybersecurity issues that might affect your company.
 -  Run realistic attack scenarios using Attack Simulator to help identify vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your organization.
