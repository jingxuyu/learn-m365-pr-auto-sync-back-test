The Action Center consolidates notifications from the operating system with shortcut tiles that enable you to perform common or frequently accessed tasks. You can find the action center by selecting the dialogue box at the bottom right corner of your screen, by using the keyboard shortcut Windows key + A, by swiping left from the screen edge on touch devices or by tapping four fingers on the track pad.

The Action Center is also your one-stop shop for notifications to see what�s going on with apps and other programs from across your device. Plus, now you can also get web notifications in your action center via Microsoft Edge sites. As always, the action center is fully customizable � check out the **Settings App**, then **System**, then **Notifications and actions**. There, you can enable and disable what notifications you see in the action center, as well as select which quick actions are available.<br>

On the Notifications &amp; actions tab, you can:

 -  Configure Quick actions. This enables you to configure which tiles appear in the Action Center. Select Add or remove quick actions to configure a particular tile.
 -  Get notifications from apps and other senders.
 -  Show notifications on the lock screen.
 -  Show reminders and incoming VoIP calls on the lock screen.
 -  Hide notifications when I�m duplicating my screen.
 -  Show me the Windows welcome experience after updates and occasionally when I sign in to highlight what�s new and suggested.
 -  Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows.

You can also configure individual apps and how they will notify you. Under the **Get notifications from these senders** heading, enable or disable notifications for each listed app.

## Focus Assist

While notifications can be helpful in managing the users day, they can be distracting in scenarios such as focusing on a particular task or giving a presentation. Focus Asset allows users to suppress these notifications. Focus Assist can be enabled as needed using the Action center, or can be configured to automatically enable during certain times. It can also be configured to activate during certain scenarios, such as activating automatically when the display is duplicated, for presentation scenarios.

You can also configure priority notifications. These notifications will still occur, even if Focus Asset is enabled. Examples include communications from specific people in your contact list, telephone calls, and notifications from specific apps.
