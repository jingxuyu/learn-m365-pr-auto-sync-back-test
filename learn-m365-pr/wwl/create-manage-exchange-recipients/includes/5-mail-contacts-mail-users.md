Contacts are Exchange recipients that have a name, an alias, and an external email address. There are two types of contacts available in Exchange: mail contacts and mail users.

### Mail Contacts

Mail contacts don't have a user account in Active Directory (AD) or Microsoft 365. As such, they can't sign-in to a mailbox using, for example, Outlook.

However, mail contacts do appear throughout the organization in the global address list (GAL). They can also be added to mail-enabled security groups, distribution groups, or dynamic distribution groups (but not security groups). As a result, you can use contacts as you might use entries in your contacts folder in Outlook, with the difference being that AD or Microsoft 365 contacts are managed centrally.

You can also use contacts within your own hierarchy and assign them a manager. This approach is useful if your organization engages outside contractors or associates. After you create a contact, you can add some optional fields, such as contact information, phone numbers, notes, title, department, company, manager, and direct reports. Finally, you can configure a MailTip that appears when someone sends a message to that person.

### Mail Users

A mail user combines some of the attributes of a full mailbox user along with the characteristics of a contact. Mail users enable administrators to provide sign-in facilities to Microsoft 365 while continuing to provide an external email address.

Organizations that use associates often use mail user accounts to provide sign-in facilities to these personnel while forwarding their emails to their external email address. The mail user accounts can be assigned to a manager and department for administrative purposes.

The characteristics of a mail user include:

 -  They can log into AD or Microsoft 365 and access resources such as OneDrive for Business or SharePoint Online.
 -  They have an email address that is external to Microsoft 365, registered against the **ExternalEmailAddress.**
 -  They can have a secondary email address for the default &lt;tenantname&gt;.onmicrosoft.com domain.

### Create and manage Contacts

You can create or manage a contact after deciding what type of contact you need. Contacts can be added and maintained through either the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) or Windows PowerShell.

To create a contact in the Microsoft 365 EAC, you should complete the following steps:

1.  In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, select **Show all** and then under **Admin centers** select **Exchange**.
2.  In the **Exchange admin center**, if necessary, select **Recipients** in the left-hand navigation pane to expand this group.
3.  Under the **Recipients** group, select **Contacts**.
4.  On the **Contacts** page, select **+Add a contact** on the menu bar.
5.  In the **Add contact** pane that appears, select either **Mail contact** or **Mail user** in the **Contact type** field.
6.  Enter a **First name** and **Last name**.
7.  When you tab into the **Display name** field, the value will be autogenerated based on the First and Last name fields. However, you can change the **Display name** value if necessary.
8.  In the **Email** field, enter the email address to which you want mail to be sent for that user.
9.  Enter a unique value in the **Alias** field.
10. Enter a **User ID** for the user and select the appropriate **Domain**.
11. Enter a **Password** for the user, and then enter the password again in the **Confirm** field.
12. Select **Add**.
13. Once the contact is successfully created, close the **Add contact** pane.

Depending on the type of contact you create, there are different settings that can be configured. Once you create the new mail contact, you can then edit the details to add or change further information. Select the contact from the **Contacts** page, which opens the **Contact information** pane. From this pane, you can select the following links to configure the necessary settings.

The bottom of the EAC's left-hand navigation pane includes a link to the **Classic Exchange admin center**. Selecting this option takes you to the classic (original) EAC, which enables you to update not only the same contact information, but also some extra fields. Once you've created the new mail user, you can then edit the details to add or change further information in the following tabs on the Classic EAC.

You also can use Windows PowerShell to create mail users. You may want to consider this approach if you're an experienced administrator or prefer to use Windows PowerShell to complete tasks. To create users in PowerShell, use the **New-MailContact** or **New-MailUser** cmdlets. For example, the following command creates a new mail user named JohnDoe in your Microsoft 365 tenant, and then forwards all messages to JohnDoe@contoso.com:

```powershell
New-MailUser -Name \&lt;name\&gt; -WindowsLiveID \&lt;Microsoft ID\&gt; -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String &#39;\&lt;password\&gt;&#39; -AsPlainText -Force) -ExternalEmailAddress johndoe@contoso.com
```

Deleting a contact is as simple as selecting the contact and then selecting the Delete icon in the EAC or using the **Delete-MailUser** or **Delete-MailContact** cmdlets.

### Bulk-import Contacts

Adding contacts individually can be a lengthy and boring process, so if you have several contacts to import, it's best to do this in bulk by using Windows PowerShell. Here, the **Import-CSV** cmdlet comes in handy.

To bulk import contacts, complete the following process:

1.  Create a CSV file containing the necessary information.
2.  Use PowerShell to create the contacts.
3.  Customize the newly created contacts using PowerShell.

At a minimum, you must provide values for the following fields in the CSV file:

 -  FirstName
 -  LastName
 -  Name
 -  ExternalEmailAddress

You then connect to Exchange Online using PowerShell and run the following cmdlet to create the contacts:

```powershell
Import-Csv .\ExternalContacts.csv| foreach{New-MailContact -Name $\_.Name -DisplayName $\_.Name -ExternalEmailAddress $\_.ExternalEmailAddress -FirstName $\_.FirstName -LastName $\_.LastName}
```

If you want to create mail users, you must exchange the **New-MailContact** cmdlet with **New-MailUser**.

**Additional reading.** For detailed instructions on how to bulk import contacts and to view a sample CSV file that you can use to import contacts, see [Bulk import external contacts to Exchange](/microsoft-365/compliance/bulk-import-external-contacts?azure-portal=true).

### Hide Contacts

Since contacts appear in the Global Address List (GAL), there may be situations when you want to hide contacts from your users. For example, if you want to use contacts for e-mail forwarding only, your users shouldn't add them to any distribution list or group.

To hide contacts, you can also use Windows PowerShell with the **Set-MailContact** or **Set-MailUser** cmdlet and the **-HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $true** parameter.

For example, the following command would hide the mail contact of Bob Kelly (BOBK):

```powershell
Set-MailContact BOBK -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $true
```
