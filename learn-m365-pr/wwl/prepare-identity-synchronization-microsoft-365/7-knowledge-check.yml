It has multiple on-premises Active Directory forests. It plans to synchronize user, group, and contact objects. It also wants to implement password hash synchronization and seamless single-sign-in. Which directory synchronization tool should Fabrikam choose?"
    choices:

      explanation: "Incorrect. DirSync was the predecessor to Azure AD Connect."
    - content: "Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync supports all of Fabrikam's requirements, except for one. It doesn't support Exchange hybrid deployments."
    - content: "Azure AD Connect sync"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Organizations like Fabrikam that plan to implement an Exchange hybrid deployment must use Azure AD Connect sync. Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync doesn't support Exchange hybrid deployments."
