Security breaches don't only affect stored information, such as files and chats. In Microsoft Teams, telephony features provide a rich experience to users but could represent a weak link in security if you don't configure them carefully.

Suppose you're an administrator for a large firm of financial advisors and you're in charge of a new Teams deployment with around 3000 users. Highly sensitive information is frequently discussed during phone calls and voice messages. You're using Phone System in Microsoft Teams as a private branch exchange (PBX) for all telephony in your company but you've recently seen a number of scam calls that phish for confidential information from your users. You want to prevent these calls from reaching users and their voicemail. You're also concerned that confidential information in voicemails may not be fully protected.

In this module, you'll learn about calling policies, protected voicemail, and caller ID policies in Microsoft Teams and how you can use them to protect your users.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the module, you should be able to:
- Explain how to configure calling policies.
- Describe how to protect your users' voicemails.
- Demonstrate how to block inbound calls.
- Explain how to configure caller ID policies.
