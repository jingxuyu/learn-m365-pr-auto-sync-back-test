  questions:
  - content: "How would you safeguard sensitive information that is being delivered via email?"
    choices:
    - content: "Email filtering."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Email filtering is a measure that lowers the possibility of malicious emails reaching employees."
    - content: "Encrypt email messages and attachments."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You use encryption to obscure the existence of your email messages or files. The recipient must use a special code or password to access the information."
    - content: "Linking the email to a device or an app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Linking your email or registering your personal device is a step required in the MFA process."
  - content: "What are the key principles of a Zero Trust security framework?"
    choices:
    - content: "To verify identity, limit access, and assume breach."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Zero Trust approach suggests never trust and always verify a user's identity before allowing access to the resources."
    - content: "To scan, block, and eliminate malware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These aren't the main principles of a Zero Trust model. An antimalware tool scans, blocks, and eliminates malware."
    - content: "To flag malicious links, identify attackers, and assume breach."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These aren't the key principles of a Zero Trust framework."
  - content: "How can you close security gaps within your organization?"
    choices:
    - content: "With the continuous practice of sandboxing."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Sandboxing is a technique used by an antimalware program to isolate malicious files."
    - content: "By continuously assessing vulnerabilities."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Vulnerability management is the routine process of scanning, identifying, monitoring, and reporting on any security vulnerabilities that the attackers tend to exploit."
    - content: "Ignoring security loopholes routinely."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Timely detection of security loopholes and implementation of strategies to combat ransomware is crucial to closing security gaps."
  - content: "What is a quarantine process used by malware removal tools?"
    choices:
    - content: "It's a process where anti-virus tools delete system files that are infected with virus."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An anti-virus program quarantines the infected system files as deleting such files will cause further damage to the device or application."
    - content: "It's a process where anti-virus tools backup data and files."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An anti-virus tool doesn't back up data and files."
    - content: "It's a process where anti-virus tools detect, relocate, and isolate files that are infected with virus."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Quarantining a file means relocating and isolating the file for the purpose of cleaning it and making it virus free."
