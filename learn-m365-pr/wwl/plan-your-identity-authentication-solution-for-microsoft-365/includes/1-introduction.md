Designing a Microsoft 365 tenant begins with planning for your on-premises infrastructure to support your new tenant. In this module, you'll take the next step in designing a tenant by planning your identity and authentication solution. You'll review a host of identity-related issues that must be planned for, including:

 -  Directory synchronization
 -  Azure AD Connect sync
 -  Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync
 -  Azure AD Connect pass-through
 -  AD FS deployments
 -  Azure Active Directory single sign-on

This module also examines the key areas that organizations must plan for to either move their Microsoft 365 service completely to the cloud or to hybridize their environment.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe authentication behavior for Office client apps when they connect with or without modern authentication to Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online.
 -  Explain multi-factor authentication in Microsoft 365 deployments.
 -  Create a plan for directory synchronization and Azure AD Connect Pass-Through authentication.
 -  Describe the issues, benefits, and recommendations when implementing federated authentication using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).
 -  Plan for Azure AD single sign-on.
