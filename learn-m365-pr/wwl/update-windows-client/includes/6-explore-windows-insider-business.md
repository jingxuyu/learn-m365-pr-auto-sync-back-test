As we already mentioned, the Windows Insider Program enables your users and support staff to become familiar with feature updates before they are released to the larger Windows community.

Windows Insider for Business extends this to help business plan for forthcoming updates and offers the following benefits:

 -  Explore and test new security, management and productivity features.
 -  Install and test Insider Preview builds on one or many devices in your organization.
 -  Use Preview Builds to test apps before feature updates are released.

Both the Windows Insider and Windows Insider for Business are part of the same program. The difference is users use their organization Azure AD credentials instead of their personal user credentials. Administrators can use policies to allow or deny the ability to install preview builds. This can be useful in creating deployment rings for authorized early-adopters.

In order to join multiple devices for Insider Preview builds, you must register your organization's Azure Active Directory domain with the Windows Insider Program. You must register using your work account in Azure AD (see Register) and you must also be assigned a Global Administrator role on that Azure AD domain. The Windows Insider Program only supports registration of domains in Azure Active Directory (and not AD DS) as a corporate authentication method.
