Malware might show up on your organization’s computers and devices, despite your efforts to prevent it. Unwanted traffic often comes from Internet-based sources, but traffic from a local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) also can compromise your network.

Windows includes components that can help you identify and remove malware from your environment’s computers and protect Windows computers from unauthorized access attempts through blocking and filtering of unwanted incoming or outgoing network traffic.
