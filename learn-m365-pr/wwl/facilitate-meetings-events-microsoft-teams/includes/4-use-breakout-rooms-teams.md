In all but the smallest meetings, it can be hard to have open discussions and a meaningful exchange of ideas. Create breakout rooms in Microsoft Teams to bring participants into small groups for lively conversation and brainstorming sessions.<br>

Only meeting organizers on the desktop versions of Teams (Windows and Mac) can create and manage breakout rooms.

> [!NOTE]
> These features are not currently available in breakout rooms:

 *  Call me
 *  Adding people to the meeting from the participants panel
 *  Adding additional people to the meeting chat
 *  Copying the **Join meeting** info
