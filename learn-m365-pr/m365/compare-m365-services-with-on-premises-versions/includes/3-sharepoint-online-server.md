SharePoint Online is a Microsoft cloud-based service. Instead of installing and deploying SharePoint Server on-premises, you can subscribe to a Microsoft 365 plan (or to the standalone SharePoint Online service). Your users can then create sites to collaborate or communicate. SharePoint Online receives all the latest features with regular updates. 

SharePoint Server is an on-premises solution. It includes the ability to create sites for collaboration and communication but will not reflect the latest updates. The on-premises product requires an organization to maintain servers, including patching, updating, and setting up and maintaining the environment for high availability and disaster recovery. All of that is handled by Microsoft with SharePoint Online.

Feature differences between SharePoint Online and an on-premises SharePoint Server include:  
- Anti-malware protection is not included in SharePoint Server. 
- Claims-based authentication is only provided with SharePoint Server. 
- Data loss prevention policies are available in SharePoint Online as part of Microsoft 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions.  
- Encryption at rest is not available in SharePoint Server.
- Not all modern web parts are available in SharePoint Server 2019, no modern pages or parts are available on-premise for earlier versions.
- Intelligent functionality based on the Microsoft Graph available in SharePoint Online.
