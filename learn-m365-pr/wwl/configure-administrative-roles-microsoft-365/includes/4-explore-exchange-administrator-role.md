The Microsoft 365 Exchange Administrator role contains permissions for managing all aspects of the Exchange product. In collaboration with the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator, the Exchange Administrator manages several different services in the Exchange Administrator Center and by remote access using PowerShell.

One of the main responsibilities of the Exchange Administrator is to help the Enterprise Administrator manage message flow in Microsoft 365. To help with this effort, the Enterprise Administrator can assign to the Exchange Administrator role various permissions to manage their organization's email and mailboxes from the Exchange admin center.

Some of the key responsibilities assigned to the Microsoft 365 Exchange Administrator role are identified in the following table.

> [!TIP]
> When the Exchange Administrator role is assigned to a user, it's recommended that they also be assigned the Service Administrator role. This way they can see important information in the Microsoft 365 admin center, such as the health of the Exchange Online service, and change and release notifications.

The following list displays some of the key tasks users can do when they're assigned to the Exchange admin role:

 -  [Recover deleted items in a user's mailbox](https://support.office.com/article/recover-deleted-items-in-a-users-mailbox-eb15194b-63ec-41b0-8d90-1823d3f558e4?azure-portal=true).
 -  [Determine how long deleted email should be retained before it's permanently deleted](https://support.office.com/article/determine-how-long-deleted-email-should-be-retained-before-its-permanently-deleted-ec3587e4-7b4a-40fb-8fb8-8aa05aeae2ce?azure-portal=true).
 -  Set up mailbox features such as the mailbox sharing policy, which determines how users can share calendar and contacts information with others outside of your organization.
 -  Set up [Send As](https://support.office.com/article/send-as-2b828c5f-41ab-4904-97b9-3b63d8129c4e?azure-portal=true) and [Send on Behalf](https://support.office.com/article/send-on-behalf-c5e7749d-244e-477f-998e-55d3876c22ec?azure-portal=true) delegates for someone's mailbox. For example, an executive may want their assistant to have permission to send mail on the executive's behalf.
 -  [Create shared mailboxes](https://support.office.com/article/create-shared-mailboxes-871a246d-3acd-4bba-948e-5de8be0544c9?azure-portal=true) so a group of people can monitor and send email from a common email address.
 -  [Set up anti-spam](https://support.office.com/article/set-up-antispam-6a601501-a6a8-4559-b2e7-56b59c96a586?azure-portal=true) and malware filters for the organization.
 -  Manage Microsoft 365 Groups.
