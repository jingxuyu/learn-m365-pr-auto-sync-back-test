As a security administrator what can you implement to prevent unknown or malicious behavior like this from occurring?"
      choices:
      - content: "Microsoft Defender for Endpoint"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft Defender for Endpoint contains many protection features, including what should be used here, but simply having Microsoft Defender for Endpoint would not prevent this behavior."
      - content: "Windows Defender Firewall"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Windows Defender Firewall blocks unauthorized network traffic flowing into or out of the local device, working with Network Awareness to apply security settings appropriate to the types of networks to which the device is connected."
      - content: "Windows Defender Credential Guard"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets, such as NTLM password hashes and Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, so that only privileged system software can access them."
      - content: "Attack surface reduction rules"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Attack surface reduction rules help to prevent malware from infecting computers with malicious code, including executable files and scripts used in Office apps or webmail."

    - content: "As the security administrator of Contoso you decide to monitor executable scripts running in mail. The Research & Development department says that it needs you to allow executable scripts to run in its mail. What would be the best solution to keep all of Contoso protected and secured?"
      choices:
      - content: "Create an attack surface reduction rule for all users that blocks executable content from their webmail and email."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This would prevent the R&D department from being able to run an executable in their email client or webmail."
      - content: "Create an attack surface reduction rule for all users that blocks executable content from their webmail, but create an audit for the R&D department."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This solution would work but would not protect end users from running executables in the desktop email client, it would only provide webmail protection. "
      - content: "Create an attack surface reduction rule for all users that blocks executable content from their webmail and email, but create an audit for the R&D department."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. This solution would protect all end users from running executables in both the webmail and desktop email client but create an exception for the R&D department to run these executables under an audit tracking. "
      - content: "Create an attack surface reduction rule for all users that audits executable content from their webmail and email."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This would allow all users to run executable content in mail under an audit tracking. While this solution may be used by some organizations, it does not meet the requirements of preventing all standard users from running executables in mail."

      - content: "Windows Defender Credential Guard"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Credential Guard uses virtualization-based security protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials so that only privileged system software can access them."
