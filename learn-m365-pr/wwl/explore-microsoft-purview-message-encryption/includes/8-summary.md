Microsoft Purview Message Encryption is an intuitive service that enables email users to send encrypted messages to people inside and outside their organization. Selected recipients can easily view their encrypted messages and return encrypted replies. Regardless of the destination email service—whether it's Microsoft 365, Outlook.com, Yahoo, Gmail, or another service—email users can send confidential business communications with an added level of protection against unauthorized access.

This module introduced you to Microsoft Purview Message Encryption. You learned that Microsoft Purview Message Encryption is an online service that's built on Microsoft Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS), which is part of Azure Information Protection. This service includes encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure your email. Messages can be encrypted by using rights management templates.

You were then introduced to working with encrypted emails. While detailed guidance about how to send and view encrypted messages is outside the scope of this training, resource links were provided for anyone interested in exploring the encryption process in more detail.

This module concluded with an examination of Microsoft Purview Advanced Message Encryption. This feature provides organizations with greater control. They can use it to create multiple templates for encrypted emails originating from within their organization. These templates can be used to control parts of the end-user experience. For example, they can specify whether recipients can use Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft Accounts to sign in to the encryption portal.
