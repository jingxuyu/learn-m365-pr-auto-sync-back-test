Many security threats are facing IT staff these days.  Examples of common security threats include network security threats and data security threats.

Common network security threats include:

* Eavesdropping attacks (also known as network sniffing), which occur when a hacker captures network packets in transit on your network.
* Denial of service (DoS) attacks, which limit the function of a network app or renders an app or network resource unavailable.
* Port scanning attacks, which can identify specific apps running on servers.
* Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITMs), where a hacker uses a computer to impersonate a legitimate host on the network with which your computers are communicating.

Common data security threats include:

* Unauthorized users accessing information on a server.
* Unauthorized users accessing data from a lost or stolen removable drive.
* Data leakage arising from a lost or stolen laptop or removable media that contain company information.
* Data leakage arising from user emails with sensitive content inadvertently being sent to unintended recipient(s).

Additionally, users experience commodity-driven threats and advanced human-operated attacks. Commodity threats include automated ransomware operations and large-scale phishing campaigns. Advanced human-operated attacks are more complex and typically begin with exploits, brute-force (password guessing) attacks, or tailored phishing emails. While many advanced attacks also use malware to infect target computers, they often use undetectable custom components and system tools. They harvest network credentials and remain persistent in collecting data over extended periods.
