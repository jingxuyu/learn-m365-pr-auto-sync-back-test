In this module, you learned about testing, debugging, and deployment options available for Office Add-ins.

## Deploy

You can make your add-in available to users in several ways.

- Local installation (sideloading)
- Centralized Deployment
- SharePoint catalog
- AppSource
- Exchange server
- Network share

Your choice will depend on considerations like:

- Who are your users?
- What are your target platforms and Office applications?
- Where are you in the development process?

## Test and debug

You can debug your add-in on your development machine if you:

- Host your add-in on a local server.
- Sideload the add-in.
- Use a web browser or other developer tools according to your platform needs.

The testing you should do depends on criteria like who you expect to use your add-in and which platforms and Office applications you plan to support.
