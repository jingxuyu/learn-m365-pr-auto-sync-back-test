There are many options to customize and configure connector results from your newly added data sources. From the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), you can create custom verticals, result types, enable result clusters, choose result layouts, and apply custom filters.

## Custom verticals and result types

Microsoft Search has two types of verticals: default and custom verticals. Default verticals like All, Files, and People provide easy access to the most commonly used search results. Custom verticals can be used to create a search experience tailored for your users and content. For example, you could create a vertical for marketing-related content and another for sales, based on the type of information each group needs. Verticals can also be used to return results from content provided through a Graph or federated connection.

To see examples of custom verticals on SharePoint, Bing, and more, check out the [What’s new and what’s next for Microsoft Graph connectors](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-search-blog/what-s-new-and-what-s-next-for-microsoft-graph-connectors/ba-p/2913895) blog post.

You can define how search results appear by designing the layout using result types. The result layout lets you show useful information directly in the search results so users can quickly find the information they need.

When creating a vertical for Graph connector content, you must create a result type or map the default layout. If you don't, the vertical won't display search results.

For more information, see [Manage search verticals](/microsoftsearch/manage-verticals) and [Manage result types](/microsoftsearch/manage-result-types).

## Search result layouts

You can design the result layout for a custom vertical using the search layout designer. Start by choosing a template and, if needed, modifying it to fit the content or your needs. For example, you can add or remove images and edit text in the template. You can also choose a blank template and design the layout yourself.

To learn more and see how layouts can help you customize search results, see [Manage search result layouts](/microsoftsearch/customize-results-layout).

## Result clusters

With result clusters, relevant content from your Graph connector sources will appear on the All results page in SharePoint, Office.com, and Bing.

For information about how clusters are selected and displayed, see [Connector result clusters](/microsoftsearch/result-cluster#how-connector-results-are-selected-and-displayed).

## Custom filters

Filters allow users to refine the results that appear for a search:

- **Out-of-the-box filters** available on default search verticals such as All, Files, Images, and News.
- **Custom filters** can be added to custom search verticals at the organization and site level.

For more information, see [Manage filters](/microsoftsearch/custom-filters).
