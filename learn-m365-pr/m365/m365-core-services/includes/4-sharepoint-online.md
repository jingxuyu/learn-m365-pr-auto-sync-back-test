SharePoint Online is the cloud evolution of Microsoft SharePoint Server. It enables organizations to create team or communication-focused sites for efficient collaboration and communication in the digital workplace. Internal users with an appropriate Microsoft 365 or SharePoint Online license can use SharePoint Online. They can share files or folders with others inside or outside the organization. Sharing outside the organization can be controlled by site administrators. 

With SharePoint Online, users can:  
- Build sites and pages, document libraries, and lists. 
- Add web parts to customize their pages. 
- Share important visuals, news, and updates with a team or more broadly. 
- Search and discover sites, files, people, and news from across their organization. 
- Manage their business processes with flows, forms, and lists. 
- Sync and store their files in the cloud so anyone can securely work with them. 
- Catch up on news on-the-go with the SharePoint mobile app.
