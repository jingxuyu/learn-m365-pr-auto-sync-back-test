  questions:
  - content: Your organization regularly collaborates with a partner on projects. In line with compliance requirements, it needs to ensure that users don't accidentally share internal documents with their external partner colleagues. What should you do?
    choices:
    - content: Use data loss prevention policies to automatically ensure internal documents can't be shared.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. This way, your organization can automatically prevent users from accidentally or deliberately sharing important documents.
    - content: Apply a confidential sensitivity label, which adds the watermark text, "confidential, for internal use only".
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. While sensitivity labels allow you to automatically label files, and apply watermarks to them across your organization, this alone won't be enough.  You still need to find a way to prevent these files from being shared and stop a user if they're about to do so.
    - content: Use automatic data classification to ensure internal documents can't be shared.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. This helps you to discover and classify all the data across the organization. It's a good first step but it won't be enough. You also need to find a way to prevent these files from being shared and stop a user if they're about to do so.
  - content: How would you describe the term data at rest?
    choices:
    - content: This is any data that is stored physically on paper, on-premises.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect.  This term doesn't apply to documents that have been printed and stored. It refers to digital data.
    - content: This is any data that isn't currently being accessed or transmitted.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. When data is in this state, it's less vulnerable than when it's in transit or use because it tends to be infrequently accessed or stored for archive.
    - content: This is any data, as long as it hasn't been kept in long-term storage.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Data kept in long-term storage can be considered to be at rest. In fact, the term refers to any data that isn't being used or moved.
  - content: Suppose you want to ensure that only authorized users within your organization can open confidential documents. What is the most effective approach?
    choices:
    - content: Use data classification to control access.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. Data classification is used to scan and classify your data. You need to ensure that the files can't be opened by unauthorized users, so this isn't enough.
    - content: Automatically encrypt all files used across the organization.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That's incorrect. If you encrypt all files regardless of whether they're confidential, or not, your organization could run into performance and productivity issues. Instead, think about how to target only confidential files based on this scenario.
    - content: Apply encryption using a sensitivity label.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That's correct. You can apply encryption with a sensitivity label. This way, you restrict access to content based on its confidentiality label.
