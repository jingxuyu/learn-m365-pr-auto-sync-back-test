Cyberthreats are an ever present and on-going concern for all organizations regardless of size.  It’s not just huge organizations that get attacked like the media would like you to believe. The key principle of any good security threat prevention is minimizing or removing the time between an attack and its response and resolution.

You work as a security analyst for a mid-sized enterprise.  You now have a good understanding of how Microsoft 365 Defender can help you and your security team.  You’re aware that incidents are a key part of the remediation process. But you don’t fully know why. Now, you want to understand what they do, and how your security team can use them to manage and classify attacks.

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand what an incident is, and how to response to them in Microsoft 365 Defender.
- Understand how to classify incidents and alerts.
- Use email notifications to keep informed of new or updated incidents.
