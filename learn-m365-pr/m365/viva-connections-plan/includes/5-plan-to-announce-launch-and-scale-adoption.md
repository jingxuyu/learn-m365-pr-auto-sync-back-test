Part of the planning process includes how you will announce the
availability of Viva Connections to the rest of your organization and
scale broad adoption across different regions and roles.

**Best practices for launching Viva Connections:**

-   Consider where and how different audiences get news and
    announcements (for example, frontline workers might get the most
    important news in team meetings and hybrid workers might be used to
    getting SharePoint news in Outlook.)
-   Plan to engage with users where they already meet and share
    information (for example, if your organization already meets in
    Teams, plan to post in channels.)
-   Use multiple communication methods and channels to reach most of
    your target audience.
-   Continue to engage early adopters and champions and use their
    enthusiasm and expertise to engage the rest of the organization
    during meetings or training sessions.
-   Regularly revisit success metrics over the first 90 days to track
    progress and learn more about how audiences engage with Viva
    Connections.
-   Ask end users for feedback and provide multiple ways to connect so
    that the experience can be improved over time

**Create an adoption plan:**

Planning for change and helping users adopt new resources will be
different for every organization. Use the considerations and best
practices here as a starting point to creating an adoption plan that
fits your organization's needs. Include considerations for change
management and training materials for end-users in your plan.

-   Viva Connections can only be accessed in Microsoft Teams. If your
    organization isn\'t already using Microsoft Teams, you\'ll need to
    plan the [adoption of Microsoft
    Teams](https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/) alongside
    [Viva Connections](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/).
-   Make adoption easy for end-users by pre-installing and pre-pinning
    the app in Teams while picking settings.
-   Find early adopters and champions and create ways to extend their
    enthusiasm to the rest of the organization.
-   Plan to engage with users where they typically meet and share
    information (for example, if your organization already meets in
    Teams, plan to post in channels.)
-   Determine who and where questions about Viva Connections should go
    to. Consider using a Yammer community, SharePoint site, or Teams
    channels that allow users to ask questions or see commonly asked
    questions.
