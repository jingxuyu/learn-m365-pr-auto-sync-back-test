Microsoft Teams is available across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. It's integrated with communications and meeting-room devices, for a frictionless experience no matter which device users work from.

Teams has desktop clients available for Windows and Mac, as well as web clients and mobile clients for Android and iOS. These clients all require an active internet connection and do not currently support an offline mode. Microsoft also offers Teams for VDI (Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure).

By default, Teams is turned on for all organizations. Administrators can assign user licenses to control individual access to Teams and allow or block what content sources are used.
