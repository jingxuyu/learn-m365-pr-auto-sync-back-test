Messaging administrators must troubleshoot their organizations' mail flow if emails aren't correctly routed inside or outside their organization. Troubleshooting is also required if secure connections can't be established successfully. In this module, you examined several tools that Microsoft provides to help messaging administrators find and fix the root causes of mail flow issues most commonly experienced by organizations.

The module began by examining the tools used to troubleshoot SMTP mail flow, including:

 -  Queue Viewer tool
 -  Delivery reports
 -  Message tracking
 -  Protocol logging
 -  Telnet
 -  Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer
 -  DSN/NDR notification messages
 -  Message header analyzation

The module then explored how to troubleshoot shared namespace environments. You began by examining the importance of a shared namespace. You then learned how to configure a shared namespace environment, which was a two-step process:

 -  Create a new accepted domain that matches the shared SMTP domain namespace.
 -  Create a new send connector that routes messages to the shared SMTP domain.

With a shared namespace in place, you were then introduced to steps that messaging administrators use to troubleshoot it.<br>

The module concluded by examining how to troubleshoot Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption issues. You learned how to secure a connector to a partner organization. You were then introduced to various steps that can be taken to troubleshoot domain security that's configured with TLS.
