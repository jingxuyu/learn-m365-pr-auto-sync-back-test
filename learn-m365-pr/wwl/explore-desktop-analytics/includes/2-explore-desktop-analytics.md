Many customers have challenges with getting and staying current with Windows. The primary challenge is testing applications. This process is typically manual. It's time-consuming for IT administrators and application owners to continually analyze existing applications. Then remediate any issues that arise.

Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service that integrates with Configuration Manager. The service provides insight and intelligence for you to make more informed decisions about the update readiness of your Windows clients. It combines data from your organization with data aggregated from millions of devices connected to Microsoft cloud services.

Use Desktop Analytics with Configuration Manager to:

 -  Create an inventory of devices and apps running in your organization.
 -  Assess app compatibility with the latest Windows feature updates.
 -  Identify compatibility issues, and receive mitigation suggestions based on cloud-enabled data insights.
 -  Create pilot groups that represent the entire application and driver estate across a minimal set of devices.
 -  Deploy Windows to pilot and production-managed devices.

After devices report data to Desktop Analytics, it provides an inventory of devices and installed apps. Once data is collected, asset data can be reviewed and categorized. Information on updates, compatibility assessment, and health status monitoring are also available. Deployment Plans can be created based on this data to help identify the smallest set of devices that provide the widest coverage of factors. It focuses on the factors that are most important to a pilot of Windows upgrades and updates. Making sure the pilot is more successful allows you to proceed more quickly and confidently to broad deployments in production.

Desktop Analytics is the successor to Windows Analytics. Existing Windows Analytics customers can migrate their existing inputs during the setup of Desktop Deployment.
