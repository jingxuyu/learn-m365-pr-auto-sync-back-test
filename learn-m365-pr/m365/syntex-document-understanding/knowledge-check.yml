    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Which step comes first after you've created your document understanding model?"
      choices:
      - content: "Create your extractor"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Before setting up your extractor, you need to train your model to properly identify the document type you are looking to categorize in the document library."
      - content: "Train the model"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The first step prior to creating your model should be training the model to identify the content type you want the model to categorize."
      - content: "Apply the model to the SharePoint library of your choice"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The model should not be applied until it is fully functional, meaning it has been trained and classifiers and extractors have been created."

    - content: "How many positive examples do you need to identify when training your document understanding model?"
      choices:
      - content: "5"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. You need at least five positive document examples to train your model."
      - content: "1"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "One positive example is not enough to train your model."
      - content: "3"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Three positive examples are not enough to train your model."

    - content: "What does an explanation do?"
      choices:
      - content: "Tells the model what elements go into making the document type"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. An explanation is what tells your model what information should be labeled and extracted from the library."
      - content: "Runs the automation that sets something as a 'Match' or 'Mismatch'"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. You must first choose “Save and Train” in order to train the model based on the explanation you set up."
      - content: "Triggers the document upload to your SharePoint library"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. You will need to choose the “Upload” option to add the desired documents to the SharePoint library."
