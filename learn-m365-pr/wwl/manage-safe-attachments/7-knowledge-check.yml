  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Allan Deyoung wants to use Exchange Online PowerShell to create a Safe Attachments policy. What's the first thing Allan should do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the New-SafeAttachmentRule cmdlet to create a Safe Attachments rule"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the first thing Allan should do. Try again."
    - content: "Use the New-SafeAttachmentPolicy cmdlet to create a Safe Attachments policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When using PowerShell to create a policy, you must create the policy before the rule. The policy must be created first so that you can later assign it to the rule. If you create the rule first, you won't have a policy to assign to it."
    - content: "Use the Set-SafeAttachmentPolicy cmdlet to update the Safe Attachments policy settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the first thing Allan should do. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to protect users from opening unsafe attachments. Holly doesn't want to create policies that block or replace attachments. Instead, Holly wants to avoid message delivery delays so that Fabrikam's users remain productive. When creating a Safe Attachments policy, what action should Holly select to implement this business requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Dynamic delivery"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. While ensuring the user is protected, dynamic delivery enables the user to remain productive. It does so by allowing the user to read and respond to the email while the attachment is being scanned."
    - content: "Block"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Policies configured to block attachments often result in delivery delays that may annoy end users and impact their productivity. Try again."
    - content: "Replace"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Policies configured to replace attachments often result in delivery delays that may annoy end users and impact their productivity. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer created a Safe Attachments policy and set the action to \"Dynamic delivery\". What will happen when an email message is received that has an infected attachment?"
    choices:
    - content: "The message is updated with an attachment that tells the recipient the original attachment was infected with malware"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Dynamic delivery allows the user to read and respond to the email while the attachment is being scanned. The user receives the email, but in place of the attachment that was originally sent, the user receives a placeholder attachment, which notifies the user the original attachment is currently being scanned. If the scanned attachment is considered infected, the message is updated with an attachment that tells the recipient the original attachment was infected with malware."
    - content: "The attachment will be included with the original message in the userâ€™s inbox along with a warning message indicating the attachment is infected"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what happens when a Safe Attachments policy is set to Dynamic delivery. Try again."
    - content: "The message is sent to the user's inbox with no attachment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what happens when a Safe Attachments policy is set to Dynamic delivery. Try again."
