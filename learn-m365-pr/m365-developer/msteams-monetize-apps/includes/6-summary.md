Developers can provide their Microsoft Teams apps to an individual, team, organization, or anyone who wants to use it. How you distribute depends on several factors including users' needs, business, technical requirements, and your goals for the app.

Developers can also distribute their apps directly to the store inside Microsoft Teams and reach millions of users around the world. If your app is also featured in the store, you can instantly reach potential customers. Apps published to the Teams store also automatically list on Microsoft AppSource, which is the official marketplace for Microsoft 365 apps and solutions.

In this module, you learned how to monetize your Microsoft Teams apps by selling them through Microsoft AppSource and the Microsoft Teams store.
