When an organization moves to Microsoft 365, it’s essential that it plans every step down to the finest detail. This effort should include identifying each goal, who will be responsible for each goal, and the due date that each goal must be completed by.

Microsoft supports this effort by providing the Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365. The purpose of this checklist is to help organizations organize, plan, and prepare for a migration to Microsoft 365. The phases and steps in the checklist are aligned with the guidance provided by Microsoft’s Onboarding Center.

The Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365, which is adaptable to any organizational needs, consists of the following five goals:
