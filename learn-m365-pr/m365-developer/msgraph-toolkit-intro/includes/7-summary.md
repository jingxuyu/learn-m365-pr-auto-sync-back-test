To integrate data from Microsoft 365 in web apps, you need to allow users to sign in to your app with their Microsoft 365 account, and issue the right requests to Microsoft Graph.

Microsoft Graph Toolkit simplifies connecting web apps to Microsoft 365 through a set of web components. With just a few lines of code, you can enable users to use their Microsoft 365 account to sign in to your app. Using Microsoft Graph Toolkit components, you can load the data you need without having to worry about composing web requests or handling exceptions.

You can use Microsoft Graph Toolkit components in any JavaScript framework. Because they're customizable, you can configure them to show data in a way that matches the user experience of your app.
