## Microsoft 365 Enterprise 

Microsoft 365 Enterprise provides enterprise-class services to organizations that want a productivity solution that includes robust threat protection, security, compliance, and analytics features.

There are three available plans for Microsoft 365 Enterprise, letting you further refine what's included in your implementation - E3, E5, and F3 (formerly F1). E5 includes all of the same features as E3 plus the latest advanced threat protection, security, and collaboration tools.  F3 is designed for Firstline Workers through purpose-built tools and resources that allow them to do their best work.

## Microsoft 365 for business

Microsoft 365 for business is designed for small- and medium-sized organizations. Like Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Microsoft 365 for business offers the full set of Office 365 productivity tools and includes security and device management features. It doesn’t include some of the more advanced information protection, compliance, or analytics tools available to enterprise subscribers. It’s designed for organizations that need up to 300 licenses; if your organization is larger than that, you’ll have to subscribe to a Microsoft 365 Enterprise plan instead.

There are three available plans for Microsoft 365 for business:  Basic, Standard, and Premium.  [Compare plans for small businesses](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business#compareProductsRegion) to determine which plan is right for your organization.
