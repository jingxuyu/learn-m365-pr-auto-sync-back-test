A product or service lifecycle typically has three phases:

1.  Private preview
2.  Public preview
3.  General availability (GA)

When a product or a service retires, it reaches the phase end of support.

### Private preview

In this phase, Microsoft might release a product or service to a limited number of users to test and evaluate new features or functionality. This phase doesn't include formal support. Typically, users can sign up to be members of a private preview, but the preview release isn't made available to the public.

### Public preview

In this phase, Microsoft typically releases public previews of products and services before their GA release to receive feedback from a broad range of users. These products and services are clearly marked as preview and include beta or pre-release features and services. This phase allows users to explore and test upcoming functionality. Users may also receive some limited support depending on the product or service.

### General availability (GA)

After the public preview is completed, Microsoft releases the product or service. The product or service becomes available to all customers with formal support, known as the release version. The products and services in this phase have been through a full development and test lifecycle to ensure stability and reliability. With Microsoft 365, new features are added to the products and services periodically. It's useful for IT developers, and administrators, to be aware of preview features before they have their general availability release. Organizations can then educate users about these new features, ensure products are used optimally and be aware of the impact on existing functionality.

### End of support

Eventually, older products or retired services can no longer be supported, and these products and services will reach the end of support. Once a product or service reaches end of support, it will no longer receive updates or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.
