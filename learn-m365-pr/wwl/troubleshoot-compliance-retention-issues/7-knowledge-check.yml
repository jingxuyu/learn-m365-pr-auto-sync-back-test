  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "A user has right-clicked their Deleted Items folder in Outlook and selected Empty Folder. What kind of operation did they execute?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A normal delete operation is when a user moves an item into the Deleted Items folder."
    - content: "Soft delete"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A soft delete is when items are removed from the Deleted Items folder and placed in the Recoverable Items folder."
    - content: "Hard delete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A hard delete is when items are purged from the Exchange database and aren't recoverable."
  - content: "An administrator colleague has asked you for help with an eDiscovery case. You try to access the case but it doesn't appear in the list within the compliance portal. Which role group do you need to be a member of?"
    choices:
    - content: "eDiscovery Manager"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Members of the eDiscovery Manager role group can only access and manage their own cases."
    - content: "eDiscovery Administrator"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Members of the eDiscovery Administrator role group can access and manage all cases, including those created by other users."
    - content: "Security Reader"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Security Reader role group doesn't grant any right to access and manage eDiscovery cases."
  - content: "You've created a retention policy in compliance portal that retains items for one year. You've applied the policy to all mailboxes in your organization. A user deletes an item that was received six months ago, and then empties their Deleted Items folder. What action will the retention policy take on this item?"
    choices:
    - content: "The policy moves the item back into the Deleted Items folder."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Retain content policies don't move items from Recoverable Items into Deleted items."
    - content: "The policy purges the item from the Exchange Online database."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Retain content policies don't purge items from the database."
    - content: "The policy takes no action on the item."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The retain content policy ensures that items remain in user mailboxes for at least the time specified (in this case, one year). After the user empties the Deleted Items folder, the item is in the Recoverable Items folder and remains available. Since the item is less than one year old, the policy need not take any action."
  - content: "A user created a calendar item in their mailbox. You have an MFA tag, applied by a policy to all mailboxes, which permanently deletes items after five years. When will the tag delete the calendar item?"
    choices:
    - content: "Five years after it was received"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The age calculation for calendar items isn't based on the date that it was received."
    - content: "Five years after it was created"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The age calculation for calendar items isn't based on the date that it was created."
    - content: "Five years after its end date"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The age calculation for calendar items is based on the item's end date."
