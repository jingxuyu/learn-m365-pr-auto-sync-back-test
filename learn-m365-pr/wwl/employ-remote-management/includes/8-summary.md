This module discusses methods used to remotely access and manage Windows clients. Remote Desktop is used to remotely access a Windows device as if you were physically using it. This can be beneficial for working remotely from a different device or troubleshooting other user's device issues. For assisting other users with their devices, Remote Assistance and Quick Assist help facilitate that process. Remote Desktop is the primary technology when accessing virtual desktop experiences, including Remote Desktop Services, Azure Virtual Desktop, and Windows 365.

Administrators can also remotely manage desktops remotely. Windows Admin Center provides a visual dashboard for remotely viewing and editing client configuration. PowerShell remoting can provide an effective method of performing configuration changes at scale using a command line or scripting.
