Microsoft Teams Phone System can be configured as a cloud-only system using Calling Plans when you do not have requirements for retaining an existing PSTN and you want a system that doesn't need you to purchase or maintain extra equipment. For situations where you do need to make use of an existing PSTN or continue to use a third-party PBX you can configure Phone System with Direct Routing.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Understand which Microsoft voice solution is right for your organization
- Understand the Contoso voice migration case study
