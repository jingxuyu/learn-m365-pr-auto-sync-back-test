The next of the **4Cs** is Check-in. This is updating the progress of your OKRs in Viva Goals and this should be done on an ongoing basis. This can either be on a regular schedule decided by your organization, such as every week, or by integrating Viva Goals with an outside data source.

There are 3 ways to update the progress of OKRs in Viva Goals.

These are:

- **Manual Check-in** - You log into Viva Goals and enter the latest value of the metric you are tracking.

- **Semi-Manual Check-in** - You update the progress of your OKRs via a collaboration platform such as Microsoft Teams.

- **Automatic Check-in** - The progress of the OKR is automatically updated every hour via an integration with an outside data source such as Azure DevOps or Microsoft Excel.

Your organization will decide how regularly it requires you to check-in and you can receive reminders to do this via email or a collaboration platform. These can be setup by your Viva Goals Admin.

### Manual Check-in

To check-in and update the progress of your **Key Result** navigate to the required Key Result.

1. Select the **Check-in** button.
1. Update the metric field with the latest figure.
1. Viva Goals will automatically suggest a **Status**.
    1. This is based on the actual progress as measured against the **Expected** progress. Using the **Start** figure and the **Target**, the system will calculate the **Expected** figure based on current point in the OKR time period.
1. You can adjust the **Status** using your own judgement based on all the applicable factors.
1. If you are not **On Track**, the guidance is that the **Status** should be **At Risk** if you are off target and do not have a plan to catch up.
1. The **Status** should be **Behind** if you are off target and do have a plan to catch up.
1. The **Include a note** field can be completed with comments giving context on the progress of the **Key Result**. You can **Upload an attachment** for further context and evidence.
1. When you are ready, select the **Check-in** button.

The progress of your **Key Result** will be updated. This will roll up and update the progress of the **Objective** it is aligned to.

### Semi-Manual Check-in

It is possible for you to update the progress of your **Key Result** via certain collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams. Your Admin can enable the integration with these platforms.

Once these integrations have been enabled and connected, it is possible for you enter the latest figure for your **Key Result** metric into the collaboration platform, and this will be reflected in Viva Goals.

For a full description of all Viva Goals integrations and how to enable and connect them, see **Introduction to Viva Goals Integrations**. \[INSERT LINK HERE\]

### Automatic Check-in

The progress of the OKR can be automatically updated every hour via an integration with an outside data source.

Your Admin can enable and then connect Viva Goals to an outside data source. A number from that system can then be used to update the progress of your **Key Result** metric.

**Key Results** that have been integrated to an outside data source display the relevant icon for that third party system.

To manually sync with the outside data source to receive the most up to date figure, select that icon and select **Sync now**.
