During your add-in development, you need to verify functionality and fix issues. Several developer tools are available to help you debug your add-in.

## Host your add-in on a web server

As you develop and test your add-in, it can be hosted locally on your machine. If you use Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins, your add-in will be hosted using Node.js. With Visual Studio, your add-in will be hosted using ASP.NET. To make your add-in accessible to other users, you need to host it on a web server, either your own or through a service like Azure.

## Test and debug your add-in

To work on and test your add-in, you'll start by sideloading it (that is, installing it locally) then debug to figure out why it's not behaving as expected. Test your add-in to ensure it works properly on platforms and Office application versions that your users are on.

Depending on your needs, you can take advantage of the Office 365 Developer Program that provides you with an Office 365 tenant for your testing.
