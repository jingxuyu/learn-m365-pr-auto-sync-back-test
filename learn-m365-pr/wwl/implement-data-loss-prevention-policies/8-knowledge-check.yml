    - content: "Sending a notification"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The option to override is per rule. It overrides all the actions in the rule, with one exception. The Sending a notification action can't be overridden."

  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer was a bit confused as to how a notice appeared on the Microsoft Purview compliance portal's Home page that indicated someone had sent an email containing a credit card number. Fabrikam's DLP project team, which Holly was leading, had yet to create its first DLP policy. Without a custom DLP policy in place, how could this DLP violation have been caught?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Purview DLP includes multiple templates that are constantly checking for specific violations"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. DLP does include templates, but they're used for creating custom DLP policies. They're not actively checking for DLP violations."
    - content: "Microsoft Purview DLP has a default policy that's in-place and running"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Before an organization even creates its first Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy, DLP is helping to protect its sensitive information with a default policy. The default policy helps keep an organization's sensitive content secure by notifying it when email or documents containing a credit card number are shared with someone outside the organization. This recommendation is displayed in a tile on the Home page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal."
    - content: "Exchange Online has a built-in DLP policy that checks for emails containing sensitive data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Exchange Online doesn't include a built-in DLP policy checking for sensitive data."
