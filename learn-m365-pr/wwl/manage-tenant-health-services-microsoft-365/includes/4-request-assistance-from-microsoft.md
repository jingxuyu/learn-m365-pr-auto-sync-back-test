### Administrator role and responsibilities

People with Microsoft 365 administrator roles are the only ones in the customer’s organization authorized to access the Admin section of the Microsoft 365 portal and to communicate directly with Microsoft about Microsoft 365 service requests.

With Microsoft 365 Enterprise and Microsoft 365 Business plans, you can choose several types of administrators who serve different functions. This service description uses the generic title administrator to refer to all categories of administrators.

The administrator is:

 *  responsible for service administration and account maintenance.
 *  the primary contact that sets up and supports each service user.
 *  authorized to submit service requests to Microsoft.

The administrator’s role is to:

 *  provide user account setup and configuration to allow users access to the services.
 *  address client connectivity, client software, and mobility installation issues.
 *  address service availability issues within the customer’s organizational span of control.
 *  use Microsoft’s self-service support resources to resolve support issues.

Microsoft support’s role is to:

 *  troubleshoot and provide technical guidance for customer issues and escalations.
 *  gather and validate information related to specific service requests.
 *  provide issue coordination and resolution management.
 *  maintain communication with the administrators to help ensure that issues are addressed on an ongoing basis.
 *  aid with licensing, invoicing, and subscription inquiries, and purchasing and trial inquiries.
 *  continually gather customer feedback on how to improve the service through surveys.

To Submit a Service Request:

1.  In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Show all**, select **Support**, and then select **New service request**.
2.  Fill out the required fields and be as descriptive as possible with what you're experiencing.
3.  Select **submit**.
