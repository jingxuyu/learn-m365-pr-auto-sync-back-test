Cybercriminals are unrelenting and will exploit any vulnerability in your security perimeter. When dealing with each attack, it's important to understand the attack vector and shut it down.

As you've seen, Microsoft 365 Defender empowers your security staff to respond to attacks as they happen in the form of incidents. It lets them quickly analyze the attack and its impact, respond with remediation, and classify the incident and its alerts. It can even notify essential staff when it detects a new incident or if there's an update in an incident.

Without the incident response capability of Microsoft 365 Defender, it would be much more difficult to pinpoint attacks and to act swiftly to resolve them.
