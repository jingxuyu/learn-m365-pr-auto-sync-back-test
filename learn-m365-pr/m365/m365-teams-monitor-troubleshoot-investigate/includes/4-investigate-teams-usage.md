Currently, Microsoft Teams usage reports are available from both the Microsoft 365 admin center, and the Teams admin center. The reports are similar, but not the same. Use the activity reports to identify users who haven't started to use Teams or are using only a limited number of features. By monitoring activity reports, you can better understand what training or communication is required.

## Microsoft 365 admin center reports

To view usage reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you must have global administrator permissions. There are two types of usage reports: **Teams user activity** and **Teams device usage**. To access both Teams usage reports:

1. Sign into the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
2. Select **Show all** > **Reports**.
3. Expand **Reports** > **Usage**.
4. From **Select a report**, select **Microsoft Teams**.
5. Select **Device usage** or **User activity**.

The reports display a line chart and a detailed table view for 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. In the **detailed view**, select the three bars to change the sort order, filter the data, or choose which columns are displayed. To export data to Microsoft Excel, select **Export**.

## Teams admin center reports

You can view various reports from the Teams admin center, including live event usage and public switched telephone network (PSTN) reports. To access reports from Teams admin center:

1. Sign into the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/), select **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**.
2. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select the relevant report.
3. Select the date period if applicable. Reports that require a date period also allow you to select a custom date range up to a year in the past, or six months before and after the current date.
4. For the Teams live event usage report under **Organizer**, you can optionally add a user name. When you start typing, a list of potential matches is displayed.
5. Select **Run report**.

The reports available from the Teams admin center are:

- Apps usage
- PSTN blocked users
- PSTN minute and SMS (preview)
- PSTN and SMS (preview)
- Teams device usage
- Teams live event usage

The **Apps usage report** shows app usage over 7, 30 or 90 days.  This allows trends to be identified to see what apps users are using to identify trends in order that more effective business decisions can be made.
