  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the recommended way to submit requests to anonymous HTTP REST APIs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Import the jQuery library and use the `jQuery.ajax()` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `HttpClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API."
    - content: "Use the `HttpClient` object from the SharePoint Framework API, accessible from the component's `context` object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the browser's built in support for the Fetch API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `HttpClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API. Older browsers supported by SharePoint may not implement the Fetch API, such as Internet Explorer 11."
  - content: "Why should you use the `HttpClient` object included with the SharePoint Framework API instead of the browser's native support for the Fetch API?"
    choices:
    - content: "Not all browsers support the Fetch API. The `HttpClient` is a wrapper to the Fetch API. It loads a polyfill that implements the Fetch API when the current browser doesn't implement it."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The `HttpClient` offers no benefit to the Fetch API; the SharePoint Framework offers two options for calling anonymous APIs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `HttpClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API. Older browsers supported by SharePoint may not implement the Fetch API, such as Internet Explorer 11."
    - content: "Don't use the `HttpClient` object. Use the Fetch API supported by all browsers."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `HttpClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API. Older browsers supported by SharePoint may not implement the Fetch API, such as Internet Explorer 11."
