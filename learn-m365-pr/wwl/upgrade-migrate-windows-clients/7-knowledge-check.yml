  - content: "Adventure Works Cycles has an older Windows 8.1 device that it wants to replace with a new device running Windows 11. The Desktop Administrator for Adventure Works wants to replace the current device by running a side-by-side migration to its replacement device. The Desktop Admin has completed the first three steps in the migration process. The user data and application settings on the source device were backed up to a network location. The Windows 11 OS was installed, and the most current Windows updates were installed. What's the next step that must be completed in the migration process?"
    choices:

Performing an upgrade by using a clean installation and migration process doesn't migrate the installed applications. When you complete the Windows installation, you must reinstall all applications. Windows may block the installation of any incompatible programs. To install any of these programs, contact the software vendor for an updated version that is compatible with the OS version installed."
