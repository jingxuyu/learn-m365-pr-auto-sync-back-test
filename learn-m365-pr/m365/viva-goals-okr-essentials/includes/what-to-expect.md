While the OKR framework and its implementation are relatively straightforward, introducing a new goal-setting framework across an organization can be a process that often requires employees to adjust their way of working. Put differently, introducing change requires more than a simple tactical approach, especially when it involves peoples' daily work rhythms and changes in expectation. People need time to adjust and process change. Recognizing this process and giving time and space for it increases adoption and long-term success.

Fortunately, companies often share a common journey. This unit will outline what to expect as people navigate change in their daily work rhythms and offer tips for successfully getting started with a new OKR program.

## Emotional Cycle of Change

:::image type="content" source="../media/emotional-cycle-change.jpg" alt-text="Diagram that shows the emotional cycle of change.":::

Changes are rarely as straightforward as we imagine they'll be. Think back to a major change that has happened in your own life, like moving to a new city, changing jobs, or getting a new pet. Adjusting to these changes can often feel chaotic or random, which is unsettling and makes it harder to adapt.

However, two psychologists (Don Kelley and Daryl Connor) found that the path through change is actually quite predictable. They called it the Emotional Cycle of Change, and it always consists of these five stages: uninformed optimism, informed pessimism, the valley of despair, informed optimism, and success and fulfillment.

What this means is that the emotional cycle an employee goes through as a company rolls out an OKR program might actually feel quite similar to the experience of bringing home a new puppy. Having a framework for this cycle will equip you to navigate this change more successfully and support your team to do the same.

There are five stages within the Emotional Cycle of Change.

1. **Uninformed Optimism**. This stage is similar to the feeling of getting a new puppy: you're excited, the puppy is cute, and there hasn't been any real work required of you yet. This is going to be great! In other words, resistance has not set in because the impact of change isn't yet known. With OKRs, this moment feels like OKRs will instantly catapult your company to the next level.
1. **Informed Pessimism**. Following our puppy analogy, you quickly realize that puppies require a lot of work and can be quite destructive while they're young. People at this stage are experiencing internal turmoil that the security of their past is ending but may often appear calm and collected. Within the OKR change, people are recognizing the work involved, new behavior patterns must be remembered, and things feel unfamiliar.
1. **Valley of Despair**. At this point, the puppy has begun chewing on the furniture, interrupting sleep with whining, disrupting life patterns, and the future state is unknown (that is, is this puppy going to become a great well-behaved dog?). This is the moment when a lot of people who have tried to implement OKRs give up; the results aren't in yet, and people are feeling discouraged about the work to results ratio.
1. **Informed Optimism**. This stage illustrates when people begin adapting to the change and are becoming more comfortable. The puppy has stopped chewing, and the training feels more natural. At this point, the change becomes the status quo. People tell war stories about the way it used to be and how difficult it was to get to the new way. People's fears, biases, and insecurities are no longer in play, and people are getting the hang of the rhythms, seeing how OKRs can reduce work and create alignment. The vision for how implementing OKRs will benefit everyone feels within reach.
1. **Success and Fulfillment**. Finally, you and your puppy live together peacefully, and you don't know how you ever lived without her. In the last stage of the cycle of change, people have adopted OKRs and seen the need for the change. It's no longer viewed as a threat but as an opportunity. This is the part of the OKR journey where the benefits of OKRs are felt and realized. The work of behavior change now feels natural. Individuals, teams, and departments are aligned to company goals and people experience how their goals are clarified and realized.

Understanding the Emotional Cycle of Change prepares you for what's to come and increases resilience when you or your team experiences challenges along the way. Remembering that OKRs are a journey that takes time reduces the pressure people may feel to become immediate OKR experts. A good reminder: no one jumps from Uniformed Optimism to Success and Fulfillment.

## Five best practices for getting started

### 1. Begin with the end in mind

:::image type="content" source="../media/finish.jpg" alt-text="A picture showing a group of people running on a track.":::

One of the best ways to create clear and lasting change is to be clear about why OKRs are important to your organization and what your ultimate goal is.

*Why* are you implementing the program?  

- To provide better transparency across your organization?
- To align distributed workers around a common goal?
- To spearhead a new product launch?
- To provide focus to fend off a competitor?  

Being clear on your "why" will help galvanize your employees as you kick off your program and create sustaining power when you're halfway through the quarter and excitement subsides.  

Take a moment to jot down what success looks like to you. A year from now, how will you know if you've achieved your goals?

### 2. Define your team

:::image type="content" source="../media/symphony.jpg" alt-text="A picture of a group of people playing instruments.":::

Much like an orchestra, a successful OKR rollout requires a solid team working together in concert to have a great performance. Here are the key OKR stakeholders and what they do:

- **OKR Champion:** Responsible for spearheading OKR adoption, communicating its value, and driving progress from the top.
- **OKR Admin:** Responsible for managing the product implementation process from start to finish.
- **Technical contact:** Responsible for helping with software integrations, sign-on decisions, permissions, security, and other technical questions.
- **Team Leadership:** Individuals who own Objectives and goals for the company.
- **Individual Team Members:** Individual employees who might have direct ownership of Key Results or may be observers of organization goals.

> [!NOTE]
> In smaller companies, these positions often overlap. For example, the OKR Champion could also be a senior leader, or the admin might also handle technical implementation.

### 3. Communicate clearly

:::image type="content" source="../media/presenter.jpg" alt-text="A picture containing person presenting to a group.":::

We've found that the most successful rollouts have full support and clear communication from upper management.  

It's critical that senior leaders:

- Educate their organization on the value of OKRs
- Explain why they're being implemented
- Reflect on their current culture
- Identify key stakeholders

This is especially critical when you consider the transparent nature of OKRs. Senior leaders should lead by example with regular OKR check-ins and program adoption.

### 4. Leverage the right tools

Skill yourself in all that Viva Goals has to offer! Familiarizing yourself with the basics will ensure you're off to a great start, but taking a moment now to learn about features like Integrations or Dashboards can exponentially increase the effectiveness of your OKR program.  

### 5. Be patient

:::image type="content" source="../media/patience-sapling.jpg" alt-text="A photograph showing a sapling growing out of the ground.":::

Implementing OKRs will likely take several quarters (if not years) to become truly proficient. This is normal and expected. Adjust your expectations now to a long-term learning curve and cultivate patience with yourself and your team to gain these skills.

A few things to expect:

- You'll face a few bumps in the road.
- You'll have some terribly written OKRs at the start.  
- And you'll have people in your group (from top to bottom) that will need extra convincing to get with the program.

OKRs are strategic and powerful, but they're not magic. Committing to this process, adjusting your expectations, and using a powerful tool like Viva Goals will give you the best chance at achieving your goals and rolling out a successful OKR program.
