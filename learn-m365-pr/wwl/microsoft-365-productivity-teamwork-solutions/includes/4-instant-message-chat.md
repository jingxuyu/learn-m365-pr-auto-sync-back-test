When you need to get things done, chat and instant messaging help you to work more effectively. Instant messaging or chat is ideal if you need to check something with a colleague or ask a quick question. You can also have a group discussion, to get everyone's input.

Chat and instant messaging let you work together, without cluttering up your email.

**Microsoft Teams** is your central hub for collaboration within your organization and provides a chat-based workspace to help everyone work efficiently. These are some of the advantages of using chat:

- Chat one-to-one or in groups - **keep people informed**, and **get input**.
- Eliminate email clutter including acknowledgments and putting multiple people on copy. Keep **in-boxes clear** for important messages.
- Encourage **open discussion**, asking questions and promoting **thoughtful debate**.
- Start a **call** or **share screens** to get things done faster.
- Messages are real-time, but don't interrupt your colleagues' work. So **everyone can be productive**.
- You can chat from your **mobile device** to keep in touch wherever you are.
- Useful **files can be shared** using Teams to keep everything close to hand.

Teams has everything you need to collaborate effectively, including chat, meetings, and calls. You can host audio, video, and web conferences, and chat with people inside or outside your organization.
