Mobile device users can use preinstalled (native) email and calendar apps, or install Microsoft Outlook for iOS and Android, and connect to Exchange Online with the minimum of configuration steps. However, sometimes problems can arise with connections and item synchronization.

Suppose you work for a sales outsourcing company. Your users spend all their time on the road and rely heavily on their phones and tablets to retrieve email and free/busy information. Some users have had trouble making connections and others don't see their appointments on their devices. You need to resolve these issues quickly to mitigate their impact on the users' productivity.

After completing this module, you'll know how to troubleshoot common problems that can arise when mobile devices are used to access Exchange Online.
