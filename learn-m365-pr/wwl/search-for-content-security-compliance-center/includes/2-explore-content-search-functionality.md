Organizations can use the Content search eDiscovery tool in the Microsoft 365 compliance center to search for in-place content. This type of content includes email, documents, and instant messaging conversations in your organization. The Content search tool can search for content in the following Microsoft 365 data sources:

 -  Exchange Online mailboxes<br>
 -  SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive for Business accounts<br>
 -  Microsoft Teams<br>
 -  Microsoft 365 Groups<br>
 -  Yammer Groups<br>

After you run a search, the number of content locations and an estimated number of search results are displayed on the search flyout page. You can quickly view statistics, such as the content locations that have the most items that match the search query. After you run a search, you can preview the results or export them to a local computer.

The following diagram shows that a content search is a simple keyword-based search against the Microsoft 365 services or locations in a tenant.

### Content search permissions

To have access to the **Content search** page to conduct searches and preview and export search results, an administrator, compliance officer, or eDiscovery manager must be a member of the eDiscovery Manager role group in the Security &amp; Compliance Center. You don't have to assign extra search permissions in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, or for OneDrive for Business sites.

### Content search limits

Various limits are applied to eDiscovery search tools in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. These limits include searches run on the Content search page and searches that are associated with an eDiscovery case on the Core eDiscovery page. Search limits help to maintain the health and quality of services provided to organizations.

There's no limit on the number of mailboxes and sites you can search using a Content search. However, there are limits applied to Content search to maintain the health and quality of services provided to Microsoft 365 organizations. You usually can't modify these limits, but you should take them into consideration when planning, running, and troubleshooting searches.
