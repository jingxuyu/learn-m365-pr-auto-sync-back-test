SharePoint Syntex is an Office 365 service that allows your organization to easily do three main things:

- Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to amplify human experiences
- Automate content processing
- Transform content into tangible knowledge

With SharePoint Syntex, you can use AI and machine learning to automatically and thoughtfully organize and classify documents in your SharePoint library. How this is achieved can be broken into three parts.

## Content understanding

The first part of Syntex is content understanding. AI models that don’t require any coding are what drive content understanding. Using AI, you can classify and extract the information that you pre-define in your content so that metadata is automatically applied, appearing as columns in your SharePoint document library. This allows for quicker and more efficient understanding of the information within your content.  

Returning to our mortgage finance company, automated and AI-driven content understanding can be extremely valuable for documents like inquiries where there may be less uniformity and structure to the documents, but they still need to be processed and understood in a timely manner.

## Content processing

Content processing is the more “assembly-line” version of content understanding. This is where AI models take in structured and semi-structured documents to capture, ingest, and categorize the content so that business processes can be streamlined.

At Contoso Electronics, this would be how you handle sales contracts. These contracts will have specific information and concrete data that is kept within a uniform document structure. Information from these contracts needs to be extracted so that the necessary members of your company have exactly what they need to process the contracts.

## Content compliance

And overall, this clear understanding of your content and organization allows for increased management and governance over all your data. When content is properly tagged and labeled, you will have better control over your data and be able to follow regulations more easily. Being able to correctly process data is key to ensuring that it is secure and accurate.  

Your electronics company will receive and handle very sensitive client information. Being able to easily locate and dispose of this data when appropriate sets both the company and its clients up for compliance and data governance success.

## Benefits of SharePoint Syntex

We’ve defined what it does, but what outcome can Syntex create?

By utilizing AI and machine learning to better understand your content, you can more accurately and efficiently classify and extract information. Rather than clicking and sorting through hundreds, or even thousands of files, Syntex pulls the metadata for you, making search and discovery of essential document content streamlined and seamless. This gives your team back valuable time to not only dive deeper into the content and truly understand it, but also to increase document insight and control.

Being able to work more effectively with your content and the data within it creates stronger business processes. If your team can label and categorize your content more accurately, you can leverage this information to implement better business processes. Greater organization of your data creates better organization of your business.  

And finally, control and clear insight into your content creates peace of mind. Ensure proper governance throughout all your data by establishing the processes that adhere to the necessary compliance and security standards.
