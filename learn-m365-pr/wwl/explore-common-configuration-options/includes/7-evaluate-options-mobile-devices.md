Computers play an important part in people's daily lives. The ability to carry out computing tasks at any time and in any place has become a necessity for many users.

When Windows is installed on a mobile device such as a laptop or tablet, there are several additional options unique to the mobile user.

You can access and configure mobile computer settings by using the various Settings app category pages of configuration settings. You can access various settings such as System, including Display, which the previous topic detailed, and Power, which the next topic covers. In Windows 10, the System setting also includes the tablet mode settings, which allows you to use tablet devices with full touch capabilities. Tablet mode is no longer an option in Windows 11, as the updated interface in Windows 11 provides a single interface that works well for desktop and tablet devices.

The Action Center can help you manage many of the mobile-device settings with simple tiles referred to as Quick Actions. To open the Action Center, select the Notifications balloon icon on the taskbar's notification area. You can select the Quick Actions tiles, or touch them on a touch capable device. The Quick Actions tiles let you edit different settings quickly. These tiles are:

 -  **Tablet mode**. Enables you to go into tablet mode with one select, and back to normal mode by selecting or touching it again. When tablet mode is in effect, this tile is live.
 -  **Connect**. Connects searches for wireless display and audio device by using Bluetooth, wireless, Miracast, or WiGig capable components. In the computing industry, WiGig refers to Wireless Gigabyte Alliance, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 802.11ah.
 -  **Note**. Brings up Microsoft OneNote for Windows 10.
 -  **All Settings**. Takes you to the Settings app.
 -  **VPN**. Connects a VPN connection, if you have one.
 -  **Quiet hours**. Turns off all Windows notifications during the time that you configure. This means that a new email or friend's Skype status will not trigger an audio alarm and a pop-up notification. The benefit of this Quick Action is that you do not have to turn off all notifications manually, and when you disable Quiet hours, you then see all your notifications.
 -  **Location**. Turn on or off the location based settings that many apps use.
 -  **Battery saver**. Switches the Battery saver mode on and off, which lowers the screen brightness and limits background tasks, and adjusts other settings to reduce your device's power consumption.
 -  **Airplane mode**. Turns airplane mode on or off. Airplane mode turns off wireless, cellular, and Bluetooth transmissions while keeping the device running for local tasks.
 -  **WiFi**. Turns your wireless adapter on or off.
 -  **Bluetooth**. Turns your Bluetooth adapter on or off.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Quick Actions tiles will be available on your device. Some of these tiles require that your device has specific hardware or software installed.
