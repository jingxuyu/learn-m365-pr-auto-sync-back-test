quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What are three ways OKR Champions can help ensure program success?"
    choices:
    - content: "Plan OKRs, execute OKRs, close OKRs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that ensuring program success extends beyond the mechanics of OKRs and must also focus on people and company culture."
    - content: "Create psychological safety, establish business rhythms, and make it visible."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. These three strategies create a safe place for change that intentionally builds muscle memory and familiarity."
    - content: "Focus primarily on profit, product, and people."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that ensuring program success extends beyond the mechanics of OKRs and must also focus on people and company culture."
  - content: "What are two ways OKR Champions can cultivate psychological safety?"
    choices:
    - content: "Normalize intelligent failure and celebrate small wins."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Normalizing intelligent failure creates a safe atmosphere to set stretch goals and celebrating small wins creates a more positive atmosphere where people are recognized for their work."
    - content: "Reward OKR success with bonuses and only talk about OKR successes."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that people need to feel like it's safe to fail in order to be willing to take risks (and risk-taking is essential to OKRs)."
    - content: "Increase vacation time and incentivize competition for successful OKRs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that people need to feel like it's safe to fail in order to be willing to take risks (and risk-taking is essential to OKRs)."
  - content: "What are the three stages that create the OKR framework and help make OKRs a part of daily business rhythms?"
    choices:
    - content: "Immature, intermediate, mature"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that the three stages correspond to a time period, but also refer to the actions taken along the way that build OKR muscle memory."
    - content: "Week, month, year"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that the three stages correspond to a time period, but also refer to the actions taken along the way that build OKR muscle memory."
    - content: "Create, check-in, close"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Each of these stages are a crucial part of the OKR cycle that are essential for the long-term success of the OKR program."
  - content: "What is habit stacking?"
    choices:
    - content: "A strategy for implementing new behavior that groups small activities and links them to an established habit."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Habit stacking connects a new action to one that already established."
    - content: "A method for organizing tasks to make sure they all get completed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that habit stacking helps ensure program success by using existing behaviors to help add new ones."
    - content: "A mathematical approach to adding a new habit that doubles the action and halves the time."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remember that habit stacking helps ensure program success by using existing behaviors to help add new ones."
