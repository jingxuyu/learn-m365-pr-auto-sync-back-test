As previously mentioned, Microsoft 365 includes two Mobile Device Management (MDM) services: Basic Mobility and Security and Microsoft Intune. This unit provides a detailed examination of each offering. Hopefully, this information will help your organization determine which solution provides the best fit to meet your MDM requirements.

### Introduction to Basic Mobility and Security

The Basic Mobility and Security service provides a built-in MDM solution within Microsoft 365. This service provides the core device management features available in Microsoft 365. It's hosted by the Intune service and includes a subset of Intune services. Even though it includes some Intune features, it's not an "Intune-lite" solution. The Basic Mobility and Security service provides core MDM functionality within Microsoft 365 for managing devices in your organization.

Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that are used to access work email, calendar, contacts, and documents play a significant part in making sure that employees get their work done anytime, from anywhere. So it’s critical that you help protect your organization's information when people use devices. You can use Basic Mobility and Security to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices if they’re lost or stolen.

You can use Basic Mobility and Security to manage many types of mobile devices, such as Windows Phone, Android, iPhone, and iPad. To manage mobile devices used by people in your organization, each person must have an applicable Microsoft 365 license, and their device must be enrolled in Basic Mobility and Security.

After Basic Mobility and Security is set up and your users have enrolled their devices, you can manage the devices, block access, or even wipe a device, if needed.

### Introduction to Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune provides the core features found within Basic Mobility and Security, plus more advanced device management features. Intune is Microsoft's gold-level standard for MDM solutions. It's not only a cloud-based service, but its focus extends beyond mobile device management (MDM) and also includes mobile application management (MAM).

 -  **Device management.** Intune enables an organization to control how its devices are used, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. It also enables people in your organization to use their personal devices for school or work. On personal devices, Intune helps ensure that organization data stays protected, and it can isolate organizational data from personal data.
 -  **Application management.** Intune enables organizations to configure specific policies to control applications. For example, you can prevent emails from being sent to people outside your organization.

Many organizations, such as Microsoft, use Intune to secure proprietary data that users access from their company-owned and personal mobile devices. Intune helps organizations secure and monitor data access by including:

 -  device and app configuration policies
 -  software update policies
 -  installation statuses (charts, tables, and reports)

It's common for people to have multiple devices that use different platforms. For example, an employee may use Surface Pro for work and an Android mobile device in their personal life. It's also common for people to access organizational resources, such as Microsoft Outlook and SharePoint, from each of their devices.

With Intune, you can manage multiple devices per person and the different platforms that run on each device, including iOS/iPadOS, macOS, Android, and Windows. Intune separates policies and settings by device platform. So it's easy to manage and view the devices of a specific platform.

### <br>Differences in capabilities<br>

While Microsoft Intune and built-in Basic Mobility &amp; Security both give you the ability to manage mobile devices in your organization, there are key differences in capabilities between the two solutions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Basic Mobility and Security service provides core MDM functionality and a subset of functionality provided by Intune. For organizations requiring a more advanced MDM solution, Microsoft Intune provides this same core functionality as Basic Mobility and Security, plus advanced MDM features and Mobile Application Management (MAM).

The key differences between these two MDM offerings are summarized in the following table. You can use this side-by-side comparison to help decide which Microsoft 365 MDM service is the best fit for your organization.<br>

> [!NOTE]
> You can manage users and their mobile devices using both Intune and Basic Mobility &amp; Security in the same Microsoft 365 Business Standard organization. To do so, you must set up Basic Mobility &amp; Security first and then add Microsoft Intune. This design enables organizations to choose whether they want to manage a user’s devices with Basic Mobility &amp; Security or the more feature-rich Intune solution. The license assignment determines which service the device is enrolled in. For example, assigning an Intune license enables the Intune-only features.
