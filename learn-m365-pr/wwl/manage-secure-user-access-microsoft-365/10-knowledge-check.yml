    - content: "Password reset is only available for Microsoft 365 users with cloud identities that have passwords that aren't linked to the on-premises AD DS"

Which of the following items must you define as part of the internal user policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "The sites that Contoso's internal users need access to"
