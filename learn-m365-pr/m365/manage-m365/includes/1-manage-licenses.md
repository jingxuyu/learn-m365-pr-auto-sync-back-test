When you buy a Microsoft 365 subscription, you specify the number of licenses that you need, based on how many people you have in your organization. If you have more than one subscription, you can assign licenses to different people for each subscription.

The Microsoft 365 admin center is where you create accounts for people and assign licenses to them. As your organizational needs change, you can buy more licenses to accommodate new people. You can also remove a license when a user no longer requires it, enabling you to re-assign the license to a different person. By doing so, you can maintain the correct number of licenses your organization requires without paying for unneeded additional licenses (known as over-licensing), or running out of licenses for additional users.

Administrators might also encounter an expired license, meaning that the license wasn’t renewed, or the payment for the latest billing cycle is past due. In this case, the user whose account is associated with the expired license will have reduced functionality with Microsoft 365 features and products until the license is renewed, or an administrator allocates another license to that user. 

Administrators can also turn functions on or off within a single license for each user. As depicted in the following figure, there can be many services and tools within a single license that administrators can toggle on or off to fine-tune each user’s account settings. Note, however, that deactivating any or all features for a user does not affect license consumption; these individual controls within the user’s product licenses pane are separate from allocating a license to a user, or removing a license from a user.
