Phone System is the logical extension of Microsoft Teams that can work with or replace an organization's existing private branch exchange (PBX) used by its staff to make internal and external calls. With Phone System, users can use Teams to place, receive, and transfer calls using their mobile devices, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones that work with Teams.

Phone System provides many key capabilities to help an organization's users to be productive and collaborate in a protected way. These methods include call sharing, protected voicemail, number blocking, and more.

The followings are the key features of Phone System:

* **Auto attendants and Call queues** - Auto attendants enable an organization to set up menu options to route calls based on caller input. Call queues are waiting areas for callers. Used together, auto attendants and call queues can easily route callers to the appropriate person or department in an organization.

* **Cloud Voicemail** - Cloud Voicemail, powered by Azure Voicemail services, supports voicemail deposits to Exchange mailboxes only. Cloud Voicemail is automatically set up and provisioned for online-only users after they're assigned a Phone System license.

* **Calling identity** - By default, all outbound calls use the assigned phone number as calling identity (caller ID). With Phone System, a detailed caller ID can be displayed that pulls information from the corporate directory when calling from inside the company, showing picture ID and job title instead of just a phone number.
