Your organization has been delivering in-person, live events as part of its annual summit for years. You need to figure out how to use that experience to move from in-person to virtual, and make sure it's an accessible and inclusive event. You've previously learned about the different accessibility features available in Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams. Now it's time to look at inclusivity.

## Plan to include everyone

Creating an inclusive event starts with planning. Your virtual summit team should include people with diverse experiences and roles, including people that haven't participated in the past. (You can see the roles we recommend, including on your event team, in [Introduction to delivering virtual events with Microsoft 365](/learn/modules/m365-introduction-deliver-virtual-events-using-microsoft-teams).)

Consider these recommended tasks during the planning process:

- Prepare, publish, and enforce a Code of Conduct for the event. Include a point of contact for any concerns. Check out this [Microsoft example](https://aka.ms/VECodeofConduct).
- Include ways for people to share their preferences during registration. This can include preferred pronouns, physical and mental requirements, and other accommodations they might need. (These preferences are the equivalent of asking about dietary limitations and allergies for in-person events.)
- Review your speaker list. How diverse are they? Are there opportunities to bring in newer talent to work with seasoned presenters?
- Plan for post-event surveys to get feedback from everyone involved.

### Plan for inclusive attendees

One of the advantages of moving from in-person to virtual is that it broadens the pool of who can attend your event. Attendees may be participating from unique locations, they may have physical disabilities, and it's important that you consider who they are and what they're hoping to get from your event.

Start with [Simple things count](https://news.microsoft.com/stories/simplethingscount/), our guidance about simple ways you can be more inclusive of people with disabilities. Beyond your virtual event, this guidance can help you in all of your work and professional relationships. There are seven ways to be more inclusive – you can view a short video of each in our guidance:

- Be your usual self.
- Make sure your work is accessible.
- Disability is a strength.
- Follow the principles of inclusive design.
- Accept each person as a human first.
- Learn the appropriate etiquette.
- Follow our lead.

Consider the following questions about who your attendees are, what they're using, and where they're joining from to mitigate common event issues.

|Area  |Questions  |Actions  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Identity**     | Are the attendees members of your Microsoft 365 tenant? <br/><br/>Do you support guest attendees? Anonymous attendees?        |  Configure these items in your service policies and meeting options. Decide the scope of your viewing audience in advance.       |
|**Devices and clients**     |  What hardware and software are your attendees using? <br/><br/>Windows and Mac devices? Browsers or desktop clients? Mobile devices and tablets? <br/><br/>Room devices?           | Device type dictates elements of the experience. Teams minimizes that impact by prioritizing quality, allowing for meeting controls and focus modes.        |
|**Location**     | Hard wired or wireless? <br/><br/>Mobile networks? <br/><br/>Cellular service only?        | Network bandwidth can impact your event. Include an on-demand viewing strategy to ensure attendees can access your content when they return to a good signal location.        |

Everyone's time is valuable so be clear about what people can hope to gain from attending your event. This starts with making the name and description of your event understandable.

Think about asking all attendees to download Teams for desktop, or to upgrade their web browsers to the latest version.

If you know that your audience isn't experienced with Teams, consider including links to Teams guides on attending events with your event invitation.

## Evolve your physical events to a digital format

If you already have content that you were going to use for an in-person event, or you're creating new content, consider how to optimize it for your virtual attendees. New methods of sharing information are key to delivering a successful virtual event. These tips will help improve the engagement and accessibility of your event.

### Shorter sessions

Minimize the amount of information you share. Have a clear topic and a follow-up call to action. Consider breaking up long sessions into multiple, shorter sessions. Virtual events can be more tiring than in-person events, for both presenters and attendees.

For multi-hour and multi-day events, plan for breaks. Include programming breaks to give your attendees time to stretch, walk their dog, or visit the facilities.

Create an agenda that's flexible enough to cater for sessions going over or under their allotted time. Think about what you want people to see on their screens when there isn't a presenter.

### Interactive content

Look for opportunities to use online polls, trivia games relevant to your content, and prepared videos to keep the content moving. 
Allow plenty of time for Q&A. Pre-seed questions in the chat window to get the ball rolling. Sometimes people are hesitant to come off mute and speak in the virtual forum. (But remember to allow enough silence to accommodate delays in audio transmission/unmuting.)

### Presenter skills

Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse! There's no replacement for preparation. Use your virtual team as a beta audience for your presenters.

Online presentation skills are more complex when you don't have access to the non-verbal feedback from your audience. Consider making speaker training mandatory for your presenters.

Use the best hardware you can to improve video and audio. This can include external mics, video cameras, and lighting.

### Semi-live model

Consider including pre-recorded content mixed in with your live content. You can play back pre-recorded sessions with Q&A moderators. This can help reduce some of the pressure on your production staff and speakers.

### Avoid common issues

This is a lot of information. Creating a quality event can sometimes feel impossible. These recommended steps from our experts can help you avoid common issues:

- **Time to prepare**: Even a one-person event takes time to produce. Schedule events in advance and avoid throwing things together at the last minute, if you can.
- **Service and network health**: Work with your IT department to ensure your network, service, and devices are healthy. When possible, share hardware and software requirements with your attendees in advance, and ask them to make sure they're ready for the event.
- **Content quality**: Focus on the quality of your content – not even the best production can make up for poor content. Is your message clear? Will someone new to the topic understand?
- **Presentation skills**: Your speakers are the heart of your event. Make sure they have time to prepare and understand the presentation process.

**Event support**: The longer and more complex your event is, the more you'll need event support staff. Train them early. Provide easy ways for presenters and attendees to ask for help. Every event producer knows that things can and often will go wrong, but your planning and preparation can help make sure your audience has the best possible attendee experience.
