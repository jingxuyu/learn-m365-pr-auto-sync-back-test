        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "If you configure a policy using the Departing employee data theft template, you'll need to configure a Microsoft 365 HR data connector so that you can import user and log data from 3rd-party risk management and human resources platforms. HR connectors allow you to pull in human resources data from CSV files, including user termination and last employment dates. "
      - content: "Data leaks "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "If you configure a policy using the Data leaks template, you'll need to configure at least one data loss prevention (DLP) policy to use the full signal detection features of the policy template.  An HR data connector is not needed. "
