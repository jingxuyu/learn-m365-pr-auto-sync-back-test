Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to build apps that interact with the data available in Microsoft 365. In this module, you'll learn how to retrieve a list of calendar events from a user's calendar by using Microsoft Graph.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Learn how to retrieve a list of calendar events from a user's calendar by using Microsoft Graph for a given period.
- Display retrieved calendar events in an application.

## Prerequisites

- Global administrator access to aâ€¯[Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn&WT.mc_id=m365-16105-cxa)
- [Basic understanding of authentication and authorization on Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msgraph-javascript-app/?WT.mc_id=m365-16105-cxa)
- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript
- [Basic understanding of Microsoft Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/msgraph-intro-overview/?WT.mc_id=m365-16105-cxa)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Scenario

Your company is building a custom web application that allows salespeople to work with customers. One of the goals of this custom web application is to help a sales team manager arrange a meeting with the customer's accounts manager to discuss the account. The application checks the availability of the accounts manager and provides a list of times when a new meeting can be scheduled with them. The sales team manager can easily select the most suitable time, and the app then schedules the meeting for them.

When you build an application that relies on meetings or calendar events, you'll need to integrate it with a calendar. A calendar in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem can be a user's calendar or a Microsoft 365 group calendar.

Although you can write custom code for your own calendar functionality, you'll want to use the calendars in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Microsoft Graph provides a unified endpoint that can be used to connect and simplify the overall development process. The Microsoft Graph calendar API lets you manage calendar event operations for a user or a group calendar.

In this module, you'll use Microsoft Graph to list a signed-in user's calendar events for the upcoming week.
