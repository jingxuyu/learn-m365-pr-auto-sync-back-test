This module examined the compliance features available in the Exchange admin center for Exchange Server and Exchange hybrid deployments.

Compliance settings in the Microsoft 365 compliance center only apply to messages stored in Exchange Online that are routed through Exchange Online and Exchange Online Protection. These settings aren't applied to messages in on-premises Exchange Servers. If you're running a hybrid environment and you're still routing your mail flow over your on-premises servers, or if you still maintain mailboxes outside of Exchange Online, you must combine the compliance features from the on-premises Exchange admin center with the modern compliance features from the Microsoft 365 compliance center.

The module began by examining the differences between in-place and litigation hold. Organizations apply holds to preserve electronically stored information, including email that's relevant to litigation cases. You then explored how Messaging Records Management (MRM) helps organizations manage the email lifecycle and reduce legal risks associated with email and other communications.

The module then examined how to configure Data loss prevention (DLP) policies. A DLP policy is a collection of mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) that contain specific conditions, actions, and exceptions that filter messages and attachments based on their content. DLP policies can use the full power of mail flow rules to detect and then act on messages in transit.

The module concluded with an analysis of message tracking. You learned how to use message tracking for message forensics, mail flow analysis, reporting, and troubleshooting.
