This module examined how to implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) in Microsoft 365. Before the introduction of MDM solutions, companies traditionally joined desktop devices to on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and managed them through Group Policies and Configuration Manager. But in todayâ€™s world, users are employing not only desktops, but a wide assortment of devices. Most devices are mobile, and they're used from anywhere. They're often not connected to the company network, and some of them are running non-Windows operating systems. In many cases, it's not suitable or even possible to join such devices to an on-premises AD DS.

In this module, you learned that Mobile Device Management manages all popular mobile devices without joining them to an on-premises AD DS. To manage devices with MDM, organizations just need to enroll them into their MDM solution. In Microsoft 365, that means enrolling it to either Intune or Basic Mobility and Security. After devices are enrolled to MDM, organizations can still manage them through both group policies and profiles. However, MDM provides more device management features that aren't available in on-premises AD DS, such as device compliance and conditional access.

An organization should first plan its MDM solution before deploying MDM, enrolling devices to it, and managing device compliance. To assist organizations in that effort, this module examined the features of effective MDM planning. It also examined the two MDM authority solutions included in Microsoft 365 - Microsoft Intune and Basic Mobility and Security. In doing so, it compared the basic features in Microsoft Intune and Basic Mobility and Security. You also learned about the policy settings for mobile devices in each solution. The module concluded by exploring how email and document access are controlled on devices managed by MDM.
