:::image type="icon" source="../media/image7.png":::In this module, let us imagine a large chain of regional hospitals,
Lamna Healthcare, that needs an employee experience tool for their
diverse types of employees. These employees include physicians and surgeons, nurse
practitioners, Human Resources professionals, IT professionals, office
administrators, custodial staff, and many more. View a simplified Lamna Healthcare
org chart below:

Now, let’s review some scenarios Lamna Healthcare wants to support with
Viva Connections below.



### Viva Connections use cases in action
:::image type="icon" source="../media/image9.png":::

**Communicate and connect**

:::image type="content" source="../media/Kendall.png" alt-text="profile image of Kendall with headshot and job title.":::
Kendall
is a nurse at Lamna Healthcare Region C hospital ER. He needs to stay
updated on important workplace events, news, and team communication.
Quickly accessing organization communications is essential to his
everyday workflow with ever changing policies and regulations. Kendall
regularly checks his Viva Connections Feed to see the latest protocols
and procedures updates.

**Reminder:** Administrators for the Dashboard can target specific
content to different groups, so employees see the most important
organization news and access the resources they need most. This might
include highlighting office updates for remote workers, any new
organization-wide rules and regulations for managers, and any updates on
critical policy updates for frontline workers like Kendall.

**Schedule and Task Management**

Kendall also needs to regularly access schedules, task lists, and
training materials. Through the Viva Connections Dashboard, he has
direct access to his schedule and list of daily tasks. Lamna Healthcare
designed the view for the frontline workers’ Dashboard, so the most
important information and tools are right at the top. As Kendall starts
his day, he clocks in through his mobile device by accessing Teams, then
selecting Viva Connections app, and then by selecting a card. Once he is
clocked in, he can navigate to a separate Dashboard card to view new
tasks added by his manager. Now, Kendall is ready to get to work!

**View** **pay and benefits**

:::image type="content" source="../media/Jessie.png" alt-text="profile image of Jessie with headshot and job title.":::
Jessie
works in Lamna Healthcare’s Human Resources team. She is a Benefit
Specialist and answers repetitive questions from employees, including
where to find paystubs and how to request time off. Jessie collaborates
with the Dashboard administrator to make sure the Viva Connection’s
Dashboard offers self-service cards so people in the rest of the
organization can report time off and view their pay summaries. Then,
Jessie has more time to assist employees with more complex benefit
related questions.

To further customize employees’ experiences, Dashboard admins can use
Viva Connections Resources to link to other SharePoint portals like
Human Resources sites or content like frequently asked questions.

**Training and onboarding**

:::image type="content" source="../media/Amber.png" alt-text="profile image of Kendall with headshot and job title.":::Amber
is a leader at Lamna Healthcare and manages a team of eight employees.
As Lamna Healthcare has been rapidly growing its business in the past
two years, her team has been growing and becoming more diverse. As a
manager, one of her top objectives is setting up successful onboarding
and training processes for her new team members. With Viva Connections,
managers like Amber can work with the Dashboard administrator to set up
cards for new employees that include the onboarding tasks and training
in [Viva Learning](viva-connections-launch-and-monitorviva-connections-launch-and-monitor/viva/learning/) that
they need to complete. Integrations with another Viva module, [Viva
Insights](viva-connections-launch-and-monitorviva-connections-launch-and-monitor/viva/insights/), can help
create a well-rounded onboarding experience by helping team members
prioritize mental health, reserve time for focused work, and take
breaks.

Integrations with other [Microsoft Viva
modules](viva-connections-launch-and-monitorviva-connections-launch-and-monitor/viva/) like Viva Learning and
Viva Insights can help new and existing employees continue building skills through curated training and manage their work-life balance.  

**Digitize processes**

In addition to onboarding and training, Amber spends a lot of time
communicating with her team and managing tasks like approving time off
requests, reimbursements, signing documents, and managing her team’s
projects. With Viva Connections, the Dashboard administrator works with
people managers to include cards and content targeted towards managers
that make it easy to access popular documents, training materials, and
other manager-specific tools.
