**Microsoft Viva** is an employee experience platform (EXP) that empowers people and teams to be their best, from anywhere. Viva brings together communications, insights, knowledge, learning, and resources within the flow of everyday work and collaboration. Viva is powered by the full breadth and depth of Microsoft 365. It's experienced through Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 apps that people use every day. Viva includes four modules – Viva Connections, Viva Insights, Viva Topics, and Viva Learning.

### Viva Connections

**Viva Connections** was created to keep everyone in the workforce connected to each other. Today, in Microsoft 365 we have many capabilities for employee communications and engagement. We have SharePoint, Yammer, Teams and Stream. Viva Connections brings all of these capabilities together into a company branded app in Teams. It's a gateway to the employee experience, with personalized news, communications, tasks, people and resources. It provides a single curated employee destination that can be configured for specific roles like frontline workers. Leaders can communicate and engage their employees. Employees can get easy access to the tools and resources they need from one place.

Viva Connections offers added functionality through three primary components described in the following list:

 -  **Dashboard.** The dashboard is your employee’s digital toolset. It brings together the tools and resources your employees need, enabling quick and easy access whether they are in the office or in the field. The dashboard uses dynamic cards that employees can interact with to do things like complete simple tasks such as time-off requests or review health checks.
 -  **Feed.** The feed delivers updates to the right people at the right time with powerful targeting and scheduling capabilities. It’s closely integrated with Yammer, SharePoint news, and Stream to display a personalized and relevant feed, based on post-level targeting of the group's employees belong to.
 -  **Resources.** The resources experience enables a way to navigate across platforms. It provides users with a familiar navigation structure from the SharePoint app bar and allows them to open sites, pages, news, and more.

### Viva Insights

**Viva Insights** provides privacy-protected insights and actionable recommendations that help everyone in the organization work smarter and achieve balance. Viva Insights is accessed in Microsoft Teams. It uses quantitative and qualitative data to empower individuals, managers, and leaders to improve organizational productivity and wellbeing.

 -  **Individuals.** These insights provide you with personal insights that only you can see. The insights will help you identify opportunities to change how you might work so that you can do your best work. Get actionable recommendations, such as recharging with a quick mental break, protecting time for focused work, and mindfully disconnecting after-hours to help you improve wellbeing and boost productivity.
 -  **Managers.** These insights give managers the much-needed visibility into work patterns that might lead to burnout and stress. These include regular after-hours work, meeting overload, or too little focus time. Viva Insights can provide managers with recommendations like encouraging your team to turn off notifications, set boundaries in their calendar, and set daily priorities to focus on what matters most to help foster a healthy and successful team. Viva Insights in Microsoft Workplace Analytics also have advanced analysis tools and templates for customized, deep-diving into data that's shown to managers.
 -  **Organizations.** These insights can help company leaders address complex challenges and respond to change by shedding light on organizational work patterns and trends. Leaders can see how their work culture is affecting their organizational resiliency and boosting employee engagement. Viva Insights can provide recommendations on the outcomes page to see opportunities where a change could improve both employee experience and business outcomes. Viva Insights in Microsoft Workplace Analytics also have advanced analysis tools and templates for customized, deep diving into data that's shown to leaders.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft MyAnalytics and Workplace Analytics are part of this new feature set and are being updated to reflect the Microsoft Viva Insights branding over time.

### Viva Topics

**Viva Topics** focuses on knowledge and expertise. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify knowledge and experts and then organizes them into shared topics. Viva Topics helps to address a key business issue in many companies, which is providing information to users when they need it. For example, new employee hires need to learn much new information quickly, and encounter terms they know nothing about when reading through company information. Viva Topics brings knowledge to your users in the Microsoft 365 apps they use every day.

AI automatically creates a topic page for each topic. The topic page gives you more details, including definitions, relevant people, and resources from across Microsoft 365 and external sources like ServiceNow. And these topic pages are surfaced as topic cards right in apps like Office, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams. When employees select on a card, a topic page appears with documents, videos, and related people. These topic pages are edited and approved by experts and then kept up to date by AI. It’s like Wikipedia for the enterprise where AI does the first draft.

The topics are displayed to users through:

 -  Topics highlighted on SharePoint pages.
 -  Topic answers in search results.
 -  Search in office applications.
 -  Topic center home page.

### Viva Learning

**Viva Learning** is a centralized learning hub in Microsoft Teams that lets you seamlessly integrate learning and building skills into your day. In Viva Learning, your team can discover, share, recommend, and learn from content libraries provided by both your organization and partners. They can do all of this without leaving Microsoft Teams.

Viva Learning allows employees to easily discover informal and formal learning in the flow of work. It aggregates content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, third party training content, and internal content of your own all in one place. Along with AI providing aggregation and recommendations, it also allows managers to assign, track, and report on training within and across multiple teams.

There are three main views in the Viva Learning app:

- **Home.** Discover new content, trending content, and browse learning content libraries.
- **My Learning.** Access your recommendations and assignments, as well as bookmarked, recently viewed, and completed courses.
- **Manage.** Track the progress of recommendations that you made.
