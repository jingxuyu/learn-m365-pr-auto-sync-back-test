You want people in separate parts of your organization to be able to share and explore ideas together. You want to enable your organization to improve collaboration across teams and departments.

## What is Yammer

While Microsoft Teams is there to help you work with teammates on projects, Yammer is designed to help you connect with people across your organization who you might not work with directly on a regular basis. Yammer helps facilitate community collaboration and idea-sharing for your organization. You can use Yammer through your browser, or you can install Yammer on your desktop or mobile device.

## What is a Yammer network

A Yammer network is used to represent people who are all part of a single organization, and regularly collaborate. All users who are part of the same Microsoft 365 tenant (with a valid Yammer subscription) can use Yammer to work together.

Your organization can set up a domain in Microsoft 365 before to start using Yammer. For example, if your organization's domain is contoso.com, your organization's users can access the Yammer network by going to [https://www.yammer.com/contoso.com](https://www.yammer.com/contoso.com).

Yammer networks come with many settings that can your organization set, to help decide how your users should access Yammer, including:

- Setting a name for your Yammer network
- Deciding who is allowed to upload files, and enforce file format limitations
- Allowing or restricting which third-party applications can be used
- Deciding whether Yammer should fetch details about links in messages
- Choosing whether to give users the option for Yammer to auto-translate messages.
- Configuring a default language for system-wide messages

Your organization can have more than one Yammer network.

## Yammer features and capabilities

Yammer enables your users with features and capabilities to help them communicate, with a particular focus on:

- **Open communication**: Yammer helps your users from across your organization to communicate with others they wouldn't have had the chance to communicate with otherwise. For example, users from different parts of the world, and different job roles, can come together to work on a passion project or help answer questions, and resolve issues together.
- **Seamless integration with apps**: Yammer connects with Microsoft 365 Apps and other applications. For example, a group of users can work together and edit a document from their Yammer conversations.
- **Security**: Yammer helps you take advantage of the enterprise-level security features that Microsoft 365 uses to help protect your data.
- **Compliance**: Yammer comes with tools like eDiscovery to query and manage data, designed to help you to stay compliant with legal and regulatory requirements.
