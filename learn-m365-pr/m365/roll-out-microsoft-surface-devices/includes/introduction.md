Suppose you work for a small manufacturer in their admin team. Your company has invested in new Surface devices for your employees and this hardware will be rolled out team-by-team over the next few weeks. You want to ensure that you can automate the configuration and management of the devices as much as possible.

When you deploy Surface devices in an organization, you can use Microsoft tools to administer them:

- **Microsoft 365 admin center** - the place your admins manage users, licenses, and passwords.
- **Windows Autopilot** - preconfigure new devices and automatically enroll devices into Intune.
- **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** - control firmware and software management with a zero-trust strategy.

In this module, you'll explore the features of both the Microsoft 365 admin center and Microsoft Endpoint Manager. You'll follow the journey of a Surface device and see how to use Intune and Windows Autopilot to improve the out-of-box experience for your employees.
