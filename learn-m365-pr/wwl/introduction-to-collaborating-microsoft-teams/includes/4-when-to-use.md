Every team is different; there's no one-size-fits-all approach to collaboration. In this unit, you'll explore a few scenarios where Microsoft Teams can improve collaboration.<br>

When deciding if Microsoft Teams can be useful in your scenario, it can be helpful to think about business scenarios where you are currently collaborating in fragmented ways. Perhaps you don't have an organized way of storing and sharing files on your team; or it's difficult to keep track of conversations that happen across your team via email and on other platforms. In those situations, you can often bring those fragmented approaches to collaboration together in a channel with relevant apps and tools that will help everyone get their work done.

Every team and company has unique needs when it comes to collaboration. Review the following examples to understand how other teams have used Microsoft Teams to improve collaboration.
