Communication compliance is part of the new insider risk solution set in Microsoft 365 that helps minimize communication risks by helping you detect, capture, and take remediation actions for inappropriate messages in your organization. Pre-defined and custom policies allow you to scan internal and external communications for policy matches so they can be examined by designated reviewers. Reviewers can investigate scanned emails, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, or third-party communications in your organization and take appropriate remediation actions to make sure they're compliant with your organization's message standards.

Communication compliance policies in Microsoft 365 help you overcome many modern challenges associated with compliance and internal and external communications, including:

- Scanning increasing types of communication channels
- The increasing volume of message data
- Regulatory enforcement and the risk of fines

As you can see, Compliance Communication is a powerful tool that can help monitor and detect aberrant and undesirable communications either between your staff, or between your staff and third-parties.  Communication compliance isnâ€™t enabled by default, and can be found in the Solutions Catalog, under Insider Risk Management.

Once enabled, you can use the advanced machine learning to track emails and team conversations looking for inappropriate message sentiment, profanity, resumes, source code, targeted harassment, and threats. In addition, you can use it to identify instances of insider trading by looking for account details, monetary values, and credit or bank account details.

Communications Compliance is a power tool, that can help maintain and safeguard your staff, your data and your organization.
