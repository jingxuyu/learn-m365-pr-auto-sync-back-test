Microsoft Search answers—like bookmarks, Q&As, and acronyms—help provide fast, authoritative results for users looking for work or school information. For some answer types, you can target specific groups, like new hires, remote workers, or people in different regions. Also, there are features and tools to help you build answers more quickly and easily.

People outside your organization don't have access to any of the files, sites, or content in Microsoft Search answers or results. Only users signed in to a valid work or school account for your organization can see internal results. To learn more about the enhanced measures on Bing that help protect your organization, see [Security and Privacy for Microsoft Search in Bing](/microsoftsearch/security-for-search).

Here's a list of the answer types we’ll cover in this module:

- Bookmarks and Q&As
- Acronyms
- Locations and floor plans
- Files
- Sites
- People, org charts, and groups
- Calendars
- Conversations
- Power BI reports and dashboards

**Scenario:** Senior management at a large aerospace company is aiming to reduce costs and resources spent on basic IT support tickets. They’ve seen an uptick in simple questions and requests like: *How do I reset my password? Where can I get a recovery key? When should I contact the help desk?* Knowing that Microsoft Search can help answer common workplace questions like these, they reach out to the company’s Search admin to come up with a solution.
