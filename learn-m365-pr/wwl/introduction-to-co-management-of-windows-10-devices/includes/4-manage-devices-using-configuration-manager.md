Since October 2019 (starting in version 1910), Configuration Manager has been part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager. In prior versions (version 1906 and earlier), System Center Configuration Manager provided a unified management console with an automated set of administrative tools to deploy software, protect data, monitor health, and enforce compliance across all Windows devices in an organization.

This training focuses on Configuration Manager. It's designed to support the faster pace of updates for Windows 10. Configuration Manager can also manage other versions of the Windows operating system, and it can be integrated with Microsoft Intune. The integration of Configuration Manager and Intune is referred to as Co-management.

Configuration Manager enables quick and easy delivery of updates. As a result, you can always have the latest Windows management features available. Updates for Configuration Manager (Current Branch) are released three times a year. Each version is supported for 18 months from its general availability release date.

The following table identifies the main features included in the Configuration Manager (Current Branch).
