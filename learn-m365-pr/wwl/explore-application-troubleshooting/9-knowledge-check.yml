  questions:
  - content: "Your organization deployed a new sales desktop app a month ago. A few users are experiencing issues starting this app. What method should you try first to resolve the issue for these users?"

If an application repair doesn't resolve the problem, then try reinstalling the application."

      explanation: "Correct. Activation of Microsoft 365 usually occurs during installation. To remain activated, Microsoft 365 connects to the Internet at least once every 30 days. Office goes into reduced functionality mode when there is an activation issue. In this mode, most commands are unavailable and users see “product deactivated” messages when they try to use Microsoft 365 applications. The user should try to reactivate Microsoft 365 from one of the Office applications or access the Microsoft 365 portal to manage Microsoft 365 installations."
