Audio and video conferencing, desktop sharing, and other business-critical functionality in Microsoft Teams can generate significant network traffic. Make sure your network is optimized so users communicate freely and promote productivity.

Many organizations are moving work to the cloud to become more efficient and better manage costs. With Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams, you can build a cloud system that does as well as an on-premises one, providing you consider the following issues:

- Before implementation, assess your current network capability.
- Plan to configure your network for best performance with Microsoft 365 and Teams.
- Improve security using Zero Trust principals.

Microsoft Teams is part of the Microsoft 365 experience and builds on its core cloud computing features. To optimize the network for Teams, you start by optimizing Microsoft 365, following the published guidance, and then complete some extra steps that are specific to Teams.  

Suppose you work for a large multi-national company that builds bicycles. Your board of directors has approved the decision to migrate all file management, video conferencing, and chat functionality into Teams and your Microsoft 365 subscription. They've put you in charge of assessing your on-premises network to ensure it can handle the anticipated traffic Teams might generate.

In this module, you'll learn how to plan network infrastructure that supports intense Teams usage.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the networking principals that create optimal performance in Microsoft 365 and Teams, when architects follow them.
- Design your local network to ensure fast communications with Microsoft 365.
- Describe how to optimize network security by implementing Zero Trust principals.
- Demonstrate how to ensure that Teams meetings work well for users.
