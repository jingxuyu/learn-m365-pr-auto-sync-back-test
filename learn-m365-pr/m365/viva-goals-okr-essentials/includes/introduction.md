Viva Goals is an employee experience platform that allows individuals, teams, and companies to organize and track their goals or "Objectives and Key Results" (OKRs). OKRs are a goal-setting framework that drives focus, visibility, and alignment across organizations.

Imagine you work for a major company who has decided to implement OKRs. Before you can begin writing OKRs and incorporating them into your daily work rhythms, you'll need an understanding of the basic framework and how it all fits together.

OKRs are a strategy execution program that lets you layer up to your organization's mission, vision & values, and execute through Objectives and Key Results. Put differently, OKRs help connect the work you do to the mission of your organization.
