Managing your organization's resources can be complex. However, Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you by providing a single, modern, integrated management platform for managing, protecting, and monitoring all of your organization's endpoints. Endpoints include mobile devices, desktop computers, and apps that an organization uses. These endpoints may also include the on premises computers and devices used by an organization. Microsoft Endpoint Manager is the overall management platform you can use to manage your organization's endpoints. Both Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager are part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

Suppose that you're the administrator or business decision maker of a company with several thousand employees. You need to keep your corporate data safe by protecting data, apps, and devices that your employees use, as well as keep your employees productive and maximize the return on your endpoint management investment. You and your company have determined that you need to manage aspects of both your on-premises endpoints, as well as your cloud-based endpoints. Microsoft Endpoint Manager provides this capability by using cloud attach. The first part of cloud attach is called tenant attach. The second part of cloud attach is called co-management. Each can be completed independently and neither requires the other.

In this module, you'll step through the process of setting up tenant attach. When you're complete, you'll have connected your Configuration Manager implementation to your cloud tenant. All of these steps will prepare you to add and manage devices and apps from Microsoft Endpoint Manager, whether your endpoints are on-premises or cloud-based.
