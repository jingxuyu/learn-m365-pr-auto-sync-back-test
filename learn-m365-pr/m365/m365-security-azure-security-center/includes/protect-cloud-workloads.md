Azure Security Center provides proactive and comprehensive protection for your workloads in the cloud, including:

- Virtual machines and servers.
- Containers.
- Data and storage.
- Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure.
- Azure Key Vault.

In your organization, many instances of these workloads could be running at any given time, and they’re used for different business processes. You need to provide robust and intelligent protection to all your workloads.

Here, you’ll learn how you can use Azure Defender capabilities to protect these different workloads.

## Protect virtual machines and servers

Azure Security Center protects your virtual machines and servers through several measures, including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Servers, just-in-time access, adaptive application controls, and vulnerability assessments.

### Use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Azure Security Center is designed to work with other Azure services to continuously protect and monitor your servers. Azure Security Center can extend how it protects your cloud workloads by integrating with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Servers. Both services will work together to provide intelligent endpoint detection and response capabilities. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint detects threats, and triggers alerts. You can then see these alerts from Azure Security Center. From there, you can jump to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, and carry out detailed investigations to understand the scope of an attack.

You’ll need to complete some steps. For example, you can do the following higher-level steps to use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration with Azure Security Center, to protect your Windows servers:

1. Onboard your Windows servers to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
1. Make sure your Windows servers are onboarded to Azure Security Center Standard.
1. The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint sensor is then automatically enabled for Windows servers that are onboarded to Azure Security Center. Both services then begin to cooperate.

> [!NOTE]
> Use the links in the **Learn more** section at the bottom of this unit for a detailed rundown of how to perform these steps.
>
> Also, automated onboarding is only available for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows Server 2016.

### Use just-in-time (JIT) to protect virtual machine access

Attackers frequently look for accessible machines through open management ports such as Secure Shell (SSH) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This means that all of the virtual machines in your environment could be targets for an attacker. If a virtual machine becomes compromised, it can be used to attack other resources in your environment.

Of course, you want to prevent this from ever happening by perhaps closing as many ports as you can at all times. The problem is that, because your users also use these ports, you can’t practically always keep them closed. Here’s where just-in-time (JIT) can help you. JIT enables you to lock ports for inbound traffic on your virtual machines, but allow them to be opened temporarily when necessary.

You select the ports on the virtual machine you want to block for inbound traffic. Azure Security Center creates "deny all inbound traffic" rules in the Azure Firewall rules and network security (NSG) rules for the ports you specified. When a user wants to access a virtual machine, Azure Security Center checks whether they have the correct permissions, and then updates the NSGs and Azure Firewall (if there is one). This action allows inbound traffic for that user’s IP address (or range), but only for a specified duration. After this duration, Azure Security Center restores the NSGs and Azure Firewall to how they were before access was granted to the user.

Here’s how to enable JIT to protect your virtual machines:

1. In Azure Security Center, select **Just-in-time VM** access on the left pane, under **Advanced cloud defense**.

1. The **Just-in-time VM access** pane opens. You’ll see your virtual machines have been grouped into several tabs. Select **Not configured**, to configure just-in-time access for a virtual machine.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-tab.png" alt-text="Select the Not Configured tab":::

1. Select the virtual machines you want
to configure for JIT, and then select **Enable
JIT on VMs**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-enable-virtual-machines.png" alt-text="Enable JIT on virtual machines":::

1. You’ll see a list of ports that Azure Security Center recommends to protect. These include 22 for SSH and 3389 for RDP. You select any of these ports if you want to make changes to their configuration. The **Add port configuration** pane opens up for you to make changes. When you’re done, select **OK** at the bottom.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-add-port-configuration.png" alt-text="Add port configuration":::

1. Finally, select **Save**.
    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-save-port-configuration.png" alt-text="Save port configuration":::

### Adaptive application controls

Adaptive application controls are a sophisticated way for you to only allow specific applications to run your machines. Your organization probably has a group of machines that usually run the same processes on a day-to-day basis. Azure Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the kind of applications that run on your machines and create an allowed list of known and safe apps that can be further customized. Through adaptive application controls, you can get security alerts if an application other than the "allowed" ones you’ve defined ever runs on any machine. 

Here’s how you can take advantage of adaptive application controls.

If Azure Security Center identifies machines in your environment that usually run a similar set of applications, you’ll find the following in your Azure Security Center recommendations pane: **Adaptive application controls for defining safe applications should be enabled on your machines**. You can find the recommendations pane by selecting **Recommendations** under **Resource security hygiene** on the left pane of Azure Security Center.

1. When you see the recommendation, you can select **Adaptive application controls** on the left pane of Azure Security Center. This opens the adaptive application controls pane.

1. Select the **Recommended** tab. You’ll see groups of machines for which Azure Security Center recommends you apply application controls to define a list of known-safe applications.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-recommended.png" alt-text="Select the recommended tab":::

1. Select any group.

1. To configure the new rule, you’ll need to review the different sections of the **Configure application control rules** pane. These will be unique to this specific group of machines.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-configure-application-control-rules.png" alt-text="Configure application control rules":::

    1. **Select machines**: You can clear any machines you want to exclude.

    1. **Recommended applications**: You can review the list of applications that are common to this group of machines and are recommended to be allowed to run on them.

    1. **More applications**: You can also review a list of applications that either run less often on these machines, or are known for being exploitable. When you see a warning icon, it means this specific application can be used by an attacker to bypass the allow list. Be careful when you review this list.

1. When you’re done, select **Audit** at the bottom.

### Vulnerability assessment

Vulnerabilities in your machines can have a serious impact on your environment. Your machines could become vulnerable for different reasons. For example, some applications installed on your virtual machines could have vulnerabilities that might lead to an attacker breaching your virtual machine, and subsequently accessing your wider environment. Azure Security Center provides vulnerability scanning to protect your machines and the wider environment. 

Azure Security Center tries to find out whether there’s a vulnerability assessment solution installed on your machines. If a machine doesn’t have one installed, Azure Security Center gives the following recommendation for that machine: **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines**.

Here’s how you deploy vulnerability scanning to your virtual machines:

1. Go to the **Recommendations** pane in Azure Security Center.

1. Select the **A vulnerability assessment solution should be enabled on your virtual machines** recommendation:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-vulnerability-assessment.png" alt-text="Recommendation details":::

1. Select the **Unhealthy resources** tab then select the virtual machines where you want the scanner to be deployed.

1. Select **Remediate** at the bottom of the list. 

1. You can choose between different options. Select **Recommended: Deploy ASC integrated vulnerability scanner powered by Qualys (included in standard pricing tier)**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-recommended-vulnerability-solution.png" alt-text="Select recommended vulnerability solution":::

The scanner will then be installed on the machines within a few minutes. After installation, scanning will begin automatically and take place at four-hour intervals.

You can view findings for your vulnerability assessments by doing the following:

1. In the **Recommendations** pane, select the **Vulnerabilities in your virtual machines should be remediated** recommendation.

1. You’ll see findings for all of your virtual machines in your selected subscription, ordered by severity.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-affected-resources.png" alt-text="Affected resources":::

1. Look for a specific virtual machine by selecting the **Affected resources** tab. You can then select the virtual machine to view which vulnerabilities have been identified for it.

1. If you want to learn more about a certain vulnerability, you select it. A details pane will appear on the right. You can then remediate it by following the steps in the details pane.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-virtual-machine-vulnerabilities.png" alt-text="Virtual machine vulnerability details":::



## Container protection

When it comes to containers, Azure Security Center provides protection for the following resource types:

| **Resource type**                              | **Details**                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Container   hosts**                          | Azure   Security Center will scan your Docker configuration and inform you of   misconfigurations through a list of failed rules that were assessed. |
| **Azure   Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters**  | Through the Azure Security Center’s AKS bundle, you can gain better insight into   the security state of your nodes, cloud traffic, and more. |
| **Azure   Container Registry (ACR registries** | Through   the Azure Security Center’s ACR bundle, you’ll gain deeper information   about vulnerabilities of images in your ACR registries. |

> [!NOTE]
> Use the links in the **Learn more** section of this to find out more about the AKS and ACR bundles.

Azure Security Center provides protection for your containers and their apps through several measures, including:

- **Vulnerability management**: Scanning is done on your container images.

- **Environment hardening**: Your Docker configuration and Kubernetes clusters are monitored continuously.

- **Run-time protection**: Real-time threat detection for your containerized environments.

### Vulnerability management

To use vulnerability management, you’ll need to make sure you’re on the Azure Security Center standard tier. You can then enable the Container Registries bundle. You do this by going to **the Pricing & settings** pane, and then enabling **Container registries**:

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-enable-container-registries.png" alt-text="Enable container registries":::

When an image is pushed to your registry, Azure Security Center will scan it using a Qualys scanner. If issues are identified, you’ll receive recommendations through the Azure Security Center’s **Recommendations** pane. Select a
recommendation to implement it:

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-qualys-recommendation.png" alt-text="A recommendation for the Container Registry images":::

1. You’ll see details about the recommendation, including a list of registries with vulnerable
images, under the **Affected resources** section. You select a specific registry to view affected repositories:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-affected-container-registries.png" alt-text="Affected registries":::

1. Under the **Unhealthy repositories** tab, you select a repository, to see its
vulnerable images:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-unhealthy-repositories.png" alt-text="Unhealthy repositories":::

1. Then you select an image to see its vulnerabilities:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-unhealth-images.png" alt-text="Unhealthy images":::

1. You’ll see the list of findings. When you select any finding, a pane appears on the right that you can use to investigate further, and begin to remediate it.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-vulnerability-details-pane.png" alt-text="Vulnerability details":::

After you’ve remediated the issue, you’ll need to:

- Push the updated image, which will trigger another scan.
- Check the **Recommendations** pane again to make sure the **Vulnerabilities in** **Azure Container Registry images should be remediated (powered by Qualys)** recommendation is no longer there.
- Delete the old vulnerable image from your registry.

### Continuous monitoring

Azure Security Center continuously monitors your Docker configurations and Azure Kubernetes clusters. For example, it will identify unmanaged containers hosted on Linux virtual machines that run Docker containers. Azure Security Center will assess the configurations of your containers continuously, and compare them against the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark. 

Azure Security Center will then tell you if there are any containers that don’t meet a particular control. After it gives you recommendations, you can implement them as follows: 

1. Select **Compute & Apps** in the left pane of Azure Security Center, under **Resource security hygiene**.

1. Select the **Containers** tab. You’ll see a list of container host machines.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-containers.png" alt-text="Select the containers tab":::
1. Select any machine to investigate further.

1. The **Container host information** pane opens. In the **Recommendation list** section, you select a recommendation you want to implement.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-select-containers-recommendation.png" alt-text="Select a recommendation":::

1. A new pane appears. Use it to review further details about the recommendation, and possible remediation steps to take to resolve the issue.

### Run-time protection

You can also use real-time threat protection for containerized environments, and Azure Security Center will also generate alerts for security issues. 

Threat protection is provided at two levels that are configured differently:

- **Host level**: A Log Analytics agent can be installed to monitor your Linux hosts, and triggers alerts for suspicious activities coming from a node or the container that runs on it. For example, it will monitor for activities like connections with known suspicious IP addresses, or access to API servers, and alert you.

- **AKS cluster level**: When you enable the **Kubernetes option** from the **Pricing & settings** pane, Kubernetes audit logs are analyzed through agentless monitoring. Azure Security Center then monitors AKS-managed services using logs fetched by AKS. It will monitor for events like the creation of sensitive mounts or any high privileged roles.

Alerts will show up in Azure Security Center when a suspicious event occurs. These alerts help you to remediate security issues on time, and improve the protection of your containers.

## Data and storage protection

Azure Security Center helps you protect your data and storage. Azure Security Center will detect threats to your data and storage resources, alert you, and suggest remediation steps to deal with those threats. With Azure Security Center, you don’t have to be an expert, and you don’t need to learn multiple security monitoring systems to keep your data and storage secure. Azure Security Center helps you protect different data and storage resources and services including:

- Azure Storage
- Azure CosmosDB
- Azure Key Vault
- SQL Database

Azure Security Center provides specific protections for each resource or service. For example:

### Azure Key Vault support

Through advanced threat protection, Azure Key Vault detects suspicious attempts to exploit or access your Azure Key Vault accounts. When suspicious activities are detected by Azure Security Center, you’ll receive alerts.

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-key-vault-alerts-inline.png" lightbox="../media/4-key-vault-alerts-expanded.png" alt-text="Azure Key Vault security alerts":::

Azure Security Center will also send an email to the subscription administrator, which includes information about activity that occurred, and how to remediate it.

Here’s how you configure advanced threat protection for your Azure Key Vaults:

1. Go to the **Pricing & settings** pane in Azure Security Center, then select your subscription.
1. Make sure you’re on the standard tier.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-enable-key-vaults.png" alt-text="Enable Key Vaults":::

1. Set **Key Vaults (preview)** to **enabled**.
1. Select **Save** at the top.

#### Microsoft Defender for Identity for Azure Storage

Through advanced threat protection, Azure Security Center provides protection for different types of Azure Storage resources, including:

- Blob containers
- File shares
- Data lakes

For example, Azure Security Center will monitor for activities across your Azure Storage accounts and alert you based on the type of event that has occurred. You’ll receive alerts for:

- Suspicious activity: For example, someone might have accessed one of your storage accounts from an IP address that’s known to be an active exit node of Tor.
- Anomalous behavior: Normally, your storage accounts are accessed from the United States, but now access might have been attempted from another country, on a different continent. So Azure Security Center decides to alert you.

Azure Security Center also uses malware reputation screening, where hash reputation analysis is used to find out whether an uploaded file could be harmful. This means your uploaded files aren’t opened or scanned. Instead, the storage logs are scrutinized and hashes of uploaded files are compared with hashes of known viruses, spyware, trojans, and ransomware. If Azure Security Center suspects a file contains malware, it will raise an alert.

You can select an alert to get more information, along with details about how you can remediate it.

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-remediate-malware-alert-inline.png" lightbox="../media/4-remediate-malware-alert-expanded.png" alt-text="A malware alert":::

Azure Security Center can also send an email to the storage owner to approve or delete the file. You can set up workflow automation for this, by configuring an automated workflow that deletes suspicious files whenever the **Potential malware uploaded to a storage account** alert is triggered.

Here’s how you configure advanced threat protection for Azure Storage:

1. Go to the **Pricing & settings** pane in Azure Security Center, and select your subscription.
1. Make sure you’re on the standard tier of Azure Security Center.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/4-enable-storage-accounts-protection.png" alt-text="Enable storage accounts protection":::

1. Set **Storage accounts** to **enabled**.
1. Select **Save**.

## IoT protection

Every new addition to your IoT infrastructure has the potential to become another attack surface. To secure your IoT infrastructure, you’ll need to provide protection at every level. Azure Security Center helps you provide end-to-end protection for your IoT infrastructure. Through Azure Defender for IoT, you can mitigate security threats and implement security best practices and analysis across your IoT devices, hubs, and related compute and data assets and resources. You can also get a unified view and control of the security of your workloads in the cloud or on-premises, and use intelligent threat detection to respond promptly and effectively to threats.

When you want to enable Azure Defender for IoT, two different deployment options are available. Choose one of the following deployment options, based on what best meets your needs:

- **Built-in deployment**: Use this option to quickly integrate Azure Defender for IoT into your IoT Hub. You’ll get security analysis of your IoT Hub configuration, your hub and device communication patterns, along with device identity and management, and monitoring.

- **Enhanced deployment**: Use this option for enhanced security capabilities. These capabilities include comprehensive security posture management, and full threat detection across your devices, such as monitoring logins, remote connections, active applications, and more. This deployment option requires the installation of IoT security device agents on your devices to collect and analyze security events.

You’ll need to make sure the following components are in place to enable Azure Defender for IoT:

- **IoT Hub standard tier**
  - You’ll also need an Azure role that has the **Owner** role over it
- **Azure Security Center**
- **Log Analytics Workspace** (one is created for you automatically when enabling Azure Defender for IoT)

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to use enhanced deployment, you need to also check the supported platforms for agents. You should also make sure that your IoT Hub is in one of the supported regions. You can find details about supported platforms and regions in the **Learn more** section of this unit.

### Enable Azure Defender for IoT

1. Go to your **IoT Hub** in the Azure portal.
1. On the left pane, select **Overview**, under **Security**.
1. Select **Secure your IoT solution** .
1. Fill in the onboarding form that appears.

After you’ve enabled Azure Defender for IoT, it will automatically begin to identify other Azure resources and services that are part of your IoT infrastructure, and are connected to your IoT Hub through automatic relationship detection. You can also select which resources, resource groups, or subscriptions to add. Azure Defender for IoT provides security alerts and recommendations for them too.

For example, you can select Azure resources to add by doing the following steps:

1. Go to your **IoT Hub** in the Azure portal.
1. In the left pane, select **Resources** under **Security**.
1. Select **Edit**, then pick the resource groups that you want to add.
1. Select **Add**.

Azure Defender for IoT will then begin to monitor the resources you’ve added.

### Investigate and remediate security alerts and recommendations

After you’ve set up Azure Defender for IoT, it will begin to provide security alerts and recommendations to help protect your IoT infrastructure. You can now view and investigate security alerts, using the following steps:

1. Go to **Azure Security Center** in the Azure portal.
1. Select **IoT Hubs & resources**, under **Resource security hygiene**.
1. You’ll see security recommendations for your IoT Hubs. Select a recommendation to investigate it further.
