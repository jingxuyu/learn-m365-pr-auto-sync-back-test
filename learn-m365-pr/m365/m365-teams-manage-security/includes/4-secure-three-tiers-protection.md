In every company, data of different types is likely to require different levels of protection. For example, your physical locations, addresses, and reception phone numbers should be public, but employee details should be carefully protected.

Suppose you want to analyze the data that will be stored in Teams and classify it so that you can plan how much protection to implement. You want to harden your Teams data as much as possible without reducing productivity or inconveniencing customers.

Here, you'll learn about Microsoft's recommended three tiers of protection for data in Teams.

## Classify and secure data in three tiers

Microsoft recommends three tiers for protecting data, identities, and devices. The three tiers are:

-	Baseline
-	Sensitive
-	Highly sensitive

Based on these three tiers, the table below shows four configurations for Microsoft Teams and their associated SharePoint sites. The baseline tier has two options: one for public teams and one for private teams.
Use this as a guide and adjust the configurations to meet your organization's requirements. You might not need every tier.


|Setting  |Baseline (public)  |Baseline (private) |Sensitive |Highly sensitive |
|---------|---------|---------|--- |--- |
|Team |Public |Private |Private |Private |
|Restrict access to |In-tenant users, including B2B users| Members of the team, others can request access | Members of the team|Members of the team|
