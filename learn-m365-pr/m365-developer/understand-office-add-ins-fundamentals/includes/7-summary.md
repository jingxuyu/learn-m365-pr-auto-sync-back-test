In this module, you learned about the fundamental concepts and aspects of Office Add-ins.

- Office Add-ins extend the functionality of Office applications.
- Task pane and content add-ins are ways to integrate with an Office application.
- Dialogs enable authentication scenarios and provide additional space for displaying content.
- Custom functions are your own defined JavaScript or TypeScript functions that you can access like native Excel functions.
- Add-in commands are the custom ribbon or menu buttons for an add-in.
- The purpose of the manifest is for you to configure how the add-in integrates with Office.
