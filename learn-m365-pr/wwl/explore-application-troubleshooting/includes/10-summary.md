Win32 applications are typically built using Windows Installer. The Windows Installer is used by developers to package an application and ensure it's correctly installed, including the necessary dependencies. Over time, these dependencies might be impacted by other actions that can affect the application. While Windows Installer is primarily a software development tool, administrators can use the msiexec utility to perform command-line actions and troubleshoot application installations. While best practices dictate that applications shouldn't require Administrator privileges, sometimes this practice isn't always followed by developers, and elevating privileges is necessary. While most applications will run on Windows 10 or later clients, tools like the Application Compatibility Toolkit can be used to mitigate incompatible legacy applications.
