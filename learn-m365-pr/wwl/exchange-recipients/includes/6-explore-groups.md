Exchange provides different types of groups so that you can group together recipients and make them available in your global address list. This unit focuses on groups that can be used by Exchange to address a group of recipients.

> [!NOTE]
> Exchange also enables organizations to create security groups that aren't mail-enabled and can't be used for distributing email to multiple recipients in Microsoft 365. These groups are commonly used to provide access to resources, such as control access to OneDrive and SharePoint. They can also be used for Mobile Device Management.

The following table identifies the different types of groups that you can create and manage in the Exchange admin center (EAC) portal.

    Dynamic distribution lists

(Dynamic distribution groups)
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    These groups don't have a predefined member list because they use recipient filters and conditions that you define to dynamically determine membership at the time that messages are sent.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    Membership is dynamic, based on a query against the Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Domain Services.

    Microsoft 365 groups
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    These groups are available in Microsoft 365 only. They provide distribution list team collaboration functionality for small to medium teams when the requirements include functionality such as conversations, coauthoring of documents, a shared OneNote notebook, or task-based planning.
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    Membership is managed by the administrator or self-managed. This design enables users to search for a Microsoft 365 group and join it. Dynamic group membership is possible but requires an Azure AD Premium license.
