Channels are a place for the members of a team to have conversations that are relevant and public to the entire team. In this unit, you will learn how to create, manage and engage with conversations in channels to communicate with your team.

## Create and format a post or announcement

When you go to any channel in Microsoft Teams the first tab you'll see is **Posts**. Think of this as one big group conversation. Everyone who has access to the channel can see the messages on the Posts tab.

Channels have threaded conversations, meaning that all replies to a channel message stay attached to the original message. This way, the whole thread of the conversation can be easily followed by anyone reading it.

To start a conversation with the members of a channel, select the **New conversation** button at the lower left on the Posts tab. To reply to an existing conversation, select the **Reply** link underneath the message.

> [!NOTE]
> The New conversation button may be inactive (grayed out) depending on channel settings. In this case, only channel moderators may create new conversations.

Replying to an existing message thread or starting a new conversation opens a compose box for you to type and format your message. Either option sends a message to everyone in a particular channel.

You can decide who can reply to your message. Select **Everyone can reply** and change it to **You and moderators can reply** if you don't want all members of the channel to be able to reply to your message. When you're done composing your message, select **Send** :::image type="content" source="../media/send-button.png" alt-text="send button":::
. Voila! Your message is now live in the channel.

### Create an announcement

Sometimes your message needs to stand out. When you create an announcement instead of a default message you have additional options for a headline and image, which can bring more attention to your message.

:::image type="content" source="../media/announcement.png" alt-text="create announcement":::

To create an announcement:

1. In the channel, select **Format**  under the box where you type your message.
2. At the top of box that appears, select **New conversation** then change the selection to **Announcement**.
3. Enter a headline, change its background color, or add a background image for the headline area - choose from the options to format your message as needed.
4. Enter the topic of your announcement in the **Add a subhead** area, then enter the body of your message, and select **Send**.

## Post a message to multiple channels

If you have information that is relevant to members of multiple channels, you can cross-post an announcement or message to share it across multiple channels at once. You can cross-post to channels you are a member of.

To cross post in multiple channels, just select **Post in multiple channels** at the top of the message area while authoring your post or announcement.

:::image type="content" source="../media/post-in-multiple-channels.png" alt-text="post message to multiple channels":::

From there, you can select which channels to post your message or announcement to, then select **Update.**

The **To** field of the message will be updated to reflect which channels the message is being posted to. You can then finish composing your message and select **Send** when you're ready to send it. Your post will appear in the selected channels.

### Edit a cross-post

You can edit your original message in a cross-post anytime by selecting **More actions** :::image type="content" source="../media/more-options-button.png" alt-text="more options ellipse button":::
 in the post, and then choosing **Edit** :::image type="content" source="../media/pencil-edit.png" alt-text="edit pencil button":::
.

From here, you can also add channels to post in, or you can remove channels from the list. Select **Post in multiple channels &gt;Select channels** to find a channel to add. To remove a channel, just delete it from the **To** field.

Finally, for any post you create, you can make it a cross-post later by clicking **More actions** :::image type="content" source="../media/more-options-button.png" alt-text="more options ellipse button":::
 , then choosing **Edit** :::image type="content" source="../media/pencil-edit.png" alt-text="edit pencil button":::
 **&gt; Post in multiple channels &gt; Select channels**, and then selecting the channels you want to add.

## Get attention with @mentions

To get someone's attention in a channel conversation or a chat, **@mention** them. Just enter @ before their name and then select them from the menu that appears.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also mention someone simply by typing their name. Start by capitalizing the first letter and as you continue to type the name, a list of people will show for you to choose from.

:::image type="content" source="../media/mentions.png" alt-text="use at mention to get attention":::

They receive a notification, which they can select to go directly into the point in the conversation where they were mentioned.

To get the attention of an entire group, try one of the following:

* Post something in the Team's general channel. The channel name appears bold for every team member.
* Type **@general** to message everyone in the general channel.
* Type **@team** to notify everyone on that team.
* Type **@channel** to message everyone in that channel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A team owner must first enable these features.
