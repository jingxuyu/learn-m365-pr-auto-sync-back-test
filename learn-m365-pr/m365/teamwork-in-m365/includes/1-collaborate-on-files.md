Work together with anyone in real time or anytime: 

- Keep up to date with progress on your documents 
- Ask questions of your colleagues and get insights 
- Store content easily with version history and secure sharing 

Users work in a number of different ways. Sometimes they work along departmental lines; other times they work in project groups made up from team members from other departments. Often they work with people from outside their own organization, such as suppliers and customers. As a result, you must provide your users with the means to share their documents and data. This is known as collaboration.
