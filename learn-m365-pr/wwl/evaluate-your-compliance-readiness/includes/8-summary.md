This module explored the tools Microsoft 365 has to help ensure an organization's regulatory compliance. Conforming to industry and governmental regulations is critical to the successful operation of any business. The focus of this module was on the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center and formulating an organization's compliance score.

Organizations traditionally had their own networks, each of which was protected by a firewall. This design enabled them to protect the data, devices, and users within their networks. As technology has evolved, many organizations have implemented hybrid environments, with data being stored on-premises and in the cloud. Organizations are increasingly using cloud applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365 and Azure. They also have users external to their networks, using different devices to access that data. So the challenge for organizations today is to protect that information, and protect the devices and users that aren't connected to their networks.<br>

In this module, you examined how Microsoft 365 addresses these challenges to information protection and governance. Its approach provides comprehensive policies to protect and govern organizations' most important data, throughout its life cycle. You learned how Microsoft achieves this goal through a four prong approach:

 -  Unified approach to discover, classify, and label.
 -  Automatically apply policy-based actions.
 -  Proactive monitoring to identify risks.
 -  Broad coverage across locations and applications.

This module examined the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center and how to access it. It also explored the purpose and function of the Microsoft Compliance Score. You learned how an organization's compliance score is determined, and how assessments are used to formulate scores.
