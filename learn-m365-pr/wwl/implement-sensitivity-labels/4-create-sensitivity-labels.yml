  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson has created and published several sensitivity labels. Holly later used the Edit Sensitivity Label wizard to edit the settings in a label that was previously published by using a label policy. What must Holly do next to the edited label for the changes to become available to the same users?"
    choices:
    - content: "Republish the label policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't the next step that Holly should complete."
    - content: "Add the label to a new label policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't the next step that Holly should complete."
    - content: "No extra steps are needed once the wizard is finished"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If you edit a label that's already published by using a label policy, no extra steps are needed when you finish the wizard. For example, you don't need to add it to a new label policy for the changes to become available to the same users."
