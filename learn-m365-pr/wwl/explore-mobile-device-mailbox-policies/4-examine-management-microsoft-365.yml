  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Tailspin Toys, Alan Deyoung wants to implement Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365. What must Alan do to implement MDM for Microsoft 365?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implement multifactor authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While itâ€™s recommended that you implement MFA because it provides an extra layer of security, configuring MDM for Microsoft 365 doesn't require MFA. Try again."
    - content: "Configure domains for MDM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To configure MDM for Microsoft 365, you must add two publicly accessible DNS CNAME records in your custom public DNS zone that point to Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365. These records are used by clients to access and enroll in MDM."
    - content: "Subscribe to Microsoft Intune"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft Intune is a more advanced Mobile Device Management and Mobile Application Management (MAM) solution. However, it isn't required to implement MDM for Microsoft 365. Try again."
