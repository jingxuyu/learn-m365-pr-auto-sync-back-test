Organizations can use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies to identify, monitor, and protect sensitive information across Microsoft 365. They want people in their organizations who work with this sensitive information to stay compliant with their DLP policies. At the same time, they don't want to block them unnecessarily from getting their work done. Email notifications and policy tips can help achieve this goal.

A policy tip is a notification or warning that appears when someone is working with content that conflicts with a DLP policy. For example, a user shares an Excel workbook that contains personal information with an external user.<br>

Email notifications and policy tips can be used to increase awareness and help educate people about an organization's policies. Users can also be given the option to override the policy. By having this option, they won't be blocked if they have a valid business need, or if the policy is detecting a false positive.

When creating a DLP policy in the Security and Compliance Center, you can configure the user notifications to:

 -  Send an email notification that describes the issue to the people you choose.<br>
 -  Display a policy tip for content that conflicts with a DLP policy:<br>
    
     -  **Email messages in Outlook.** For email in Outlook on the web and Outlook 2013 and later, the policy tip appears at the top of a message above the recipients while the message is being composed.<br>
     -  **SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive for Business accounts.** For documents in a OneDrive for Business account or SharePoint Online site, the policy tip is indicated by a warning icon that appears on the item. To view more information, you can select an item and then choose the Information icon (a circle with the letter "i" in it) in the upper-right corner of the page to open the details pane.<br>
     -  **Microsoft Office documents.** For Excel, PowerPoint, and Word documents that are stored on a OneDrive for Business site or SharePoint Online site that's included in the DLP policy, the policy tip appears on the Message Bar and the Backstage view (**File menu &gt; Info**).<br>
