This training uses the enhanced adoption framework for teamwork and the modern workplace designed by the Microsoft Teams engineering team in partnership with adoption and marketing partners at Microsoft. This framework represents what we've learned from working with customers, listening to partners, and observing our service adoption programs worldwide. Key enhancements to this framework are:

1. It is broken into three iterative phases: **Start**, **Experiment**, and **Scale**. The phases let organizations adopt services at different rates in different regions or segments of the business. The phases also shorten the time that individual groups of people may be living in the pre- and post-change world.
1. It separates service decisions required for a scale deployment from decisions required to start experimenting with the new technology or process. This enables hands-on learning in your own environment first.
1. It emphasizes light business process mapping, identified success measures, and frequent feedback loops to ensure you're on track for success. If you get off-track, you can course correct sooner in the process to deliver a more agile project implementation.
