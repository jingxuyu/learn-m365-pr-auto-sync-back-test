Each member on your virtual summit event team has a role to play in ensuring your event is a success. While the organizer is responsible for setting up the events and working with presenters to create great content, when the meeting starts, it's the producer's time.

Producers manage the technology involved in your broadcast. Often in small to mid-size events, the organizer and the producer are the same person. In large-scale productions, this is a dedicated role with the required technical acumen. Producers should work hand in hand with the relevant IT professional staff to ensure network & service readiness for your event.

This unit walks you through how to produce a great virtual event, from getting things ready before to helping with attendee Q&A.

## Producer's view

When the organizer sets up a live event, they assign roles to participants, including the producer role. When you join the event as a producer (from either Outlook or Teams), you'll see tools and actions specific to producing the event.

 :::image type="content" source="../media/producer-overview.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the producer view in Microsoft Teams. There are callouts for the different tools, described in the text the follows this graphic." border="true":::

The right pane of the meeting window includes the following producer tools:

- Meeting health
- Q&A manager
- Meeting notes
- Chat with event team members during the event. (This is a separate chat from the meeting chat, visible only to the event team, not attendees.)
- List of the event team members
- Device controls
- Meeting information for the event team (not visible to attendees)

Your view has two panes – the **Queue** and the **Live event**. The Queue's your staging area, where you prepare the video or camera and content for the event before you send it live to the audience. You can also see when your presenters join, and you can mute them. (Be aware that presenters have to *unmute* themselves – that's not something you can do for them.)

## Get your presenters ready

You can see your presenters (and other members of the event team) by selecting **Show participants**.

You can add presenters before the event goes live by entering the presenter's name in the **Invite someone** field. If one of your presenters is late, you can use the Teams **Ask to join** feature to remind them to join the meeting.

## Pre-live

It's standard practice to ask your presenters to join 10-15 minutes before the live event starts to run through final audio and visual checks. Think of this pre-live time as your green room.

While in pre-live, the audience can't hear any audio and can only see video or shared screen content if you select **Send live**.

To queue up your first presenter, ask them to turn on their camera, and then select their video to send it to the **Queue**. If your presenter is sharing content, like a PowerPoint presentation, you can change the layout from **Single source** to **Content left**, and select their content to send it to the **Queue**. (Remember that you can use the Producer/Presenter chat to coordinate with the team.) You'll see both the content and the presenter's video in the **Queue**. You can switch between the two layouts at any time during the live event.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only one presenter can share their screen content at one time. If another presenter shares their screen during the live event, they'll override the active presenter. This is one of the reasons the producer role is important – be sure to coordinate any content changes while you're preparing for the event to ensure the smoothest event possible.

## Go live

Your presenters and content are queued up and ready to go. Select **Send live** to send the queued content to the **Live Event** pane. Confirm that you see the content and video that you expect, and then select **Start** to start the live event and begin broadcasting your presenter's audio, video, and content to the attendees.

You should see something like this:

:::image type="content" source="../media/producer-send-live.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the producer view in Microsoft Teams. There are red boxes around the elements of the view that are currently being broadcast live as part of the event - the speaker's camera and their content." border="true":::

## Run the event

Congratulations! You started your event – now you need to run it.

To change presenters, select the next presenter's camera and any other content they need in the **Queue** pane, and then select **Send live**. This replaces the current feed with the items from the **Queue**.
 
If your event has Q&A enabled, attendees can post questions. If your event team includes a moderator, they'll take care of the Q&A, but if not, you, as the producer, can review, triage, and publish the questions. Questions you publish are visible to everyone in the **Published** section of the event window; questions or messages you dismiss are in the **Dismissed** section.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unlike a Teams meeting, a live event cannot be stopped and restarted. If you accidentally select **End**, it will end the event for all attendees, and the organizer must create a new live event invite to replace it.

## End your event

The final presenter's done, the questions have all been answered, your moderator's thanked the attendees – it's time to end your event. To do this, mute everyone's audio and wait 20-30 seconds before you select **End**. (Waiting ensures any final remarks from you or your moderator reach your attendees before the end of the event.)

## Manage resources after the event

After your event, producers and presenters can access the following event resources through the event invite in the Teams Calendar:

- Event recording
- Q&A report
- Attendee engagement report
- Recording (If you do *not* want attendees to be able to access the event recording, disable that option here.)
- Transcript and other event content
