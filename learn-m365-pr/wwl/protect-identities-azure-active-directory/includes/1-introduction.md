As the number of different sets of credentials that one should manage increases, password security becomes weaker and weaker. Users often use the same password or very similar passwords for their private email accounts, social networks, and business accounts. This results in a scenario where a security breach of any user’s digital identity can jeopardize all other identities. Because of this, it’s recommended that you use additional methods of authentication when authenticating against business resources, as well as to use alternative methods for authentication. In addition, you should use technologies that can monitor user identities and user account behavior and proactively work to protect and prevent attacks.
