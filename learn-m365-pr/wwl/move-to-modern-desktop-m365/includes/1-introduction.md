Shifting to a modern desktop improves productivity and security for users and streamlines work for IT professionals.  A modern desktop is always up-to-date and uses insights and security powered by the cloud.  A Windows 10 device running Microsoft 365 Apps, managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) and powered by Microsoft 365, the world’s productivity cloud, is a modern desktop. 

## Benefits of the modern desktop 
Right now, the top reason organizations are switching to a modern desktop is to **address security concerns**. Putting the right technology in the hands of users can help protect against some of the most common security threats, like compromised credentials. Windows 10 provides security features like Windows Hello, which enables companies to eliminate passwords. It also provides support for FIDO2 security keys, which enable organizations to better secure their data and devices. Microsoft 365 Apps helps round out the security offerings for Microsoft 365, with its built-in features that integrate with Windows 10 to help you protect sensitive data, stay in control in the cloud, and meet your compliance needs. 
 
In addition to improving security, Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Apps **improve how your users get their work done**. Users can find apps, settings, documents, and messages by using enterprise search and Cortana. They can use Timeline to see a chronological view of their activities and documents.  

For both Windows 10 and Microsoft 365 Apps, **feature updates are released more frequently**, which means your users will get security and productivity capabilities multiple times a year, instead of once every three years.

## Shifting to the modern desktop 
Shift to a modern desktop by deploying Windows 10 with Microsoft 365 Apps and adopting a stay-current process that uses Windows and Office servicing to deploy regular security and feature updates.

To help you get ready for your deployment, Microsoft has released new tools and features that you can use to prepare your environment. Windows includes delivery optimization, a feature that can help improve how you deploy and manage updates to Windows and Office across your network. Application compatibility, which is always a concern for organizations that are upgrading to a new operating system or a version of Office, has been greatly improved and includes compatibility testing and the tools for testing and fixing the applications in your own environment. 

To deploy, you can use cloud-based services, including Microsoft Intune, or existing software management solutions such as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. Whatever tool you use, it’s become easier than ever to deploy and manage Windows and Office from the cloud. After deployment, Microsoft provides regular security and feature updates to keep your devices secure and as productive as possible. You can choose how to manage these updates, including automating them across your organization or defining exactly when and how they are delivered to different groups.
