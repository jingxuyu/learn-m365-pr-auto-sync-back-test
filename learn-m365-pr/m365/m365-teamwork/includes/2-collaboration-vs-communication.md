Sometimes users work along departmental lines; other times they work in project groups made up from team members from other departments. Often, they work with people from outside their own organization, such as suppliers and customers. No matter how they work you must provide your users with the means to share their documents and data. This is known as collaboration. Itâ€™s also necessary to enable these users to discuss their work. This is known as communication.

Microsoft 365 provides a few different services that enable both collaboration and communication. 

## Collaboration services 
You can use the following services to enable collaboration between your employees: 

- **Teams**. With Teams, you can create projects, share files within a project, create a wiki platform for your project, track activities, and chat and call your colleagues. 
SharePoint Online. With SharePoint, you can easily collaborate with colleagues and external contacts using file sharing, content management, Team sites, intranets, and automated workflow. 
- **Yammer**. You can use Yammer to engage with others through polls and announcements and share content with files and notes. 
- **Exchange Online Public folders**. Public folders is a feature of early versions of Exchange Server for on-premises collaboration. Exchange Online also supports this feature to enable support for your apps that require public folders. 
Skype for Business Online. Although primarily a communications platform, you can also collaborate using Skype for Business by recording meetings, screen sharing, and PowerPoint annotation. Use whiteboard, polls, Q&A, and built-in IM chats during your business meetings to make them more productive.
