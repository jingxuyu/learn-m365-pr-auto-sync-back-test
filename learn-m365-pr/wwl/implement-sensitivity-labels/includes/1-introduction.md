Sensitive data presents significant risk to a company if it's stolen, inadvertently shared, or exposed through a breach. Risk factors include reputational damage, financial impact, and loss of competitive advantage. Undoubtedly, protecting the data and information your business manages is a top priority for your organization.

Sensitivity labels are an important tool in addressing data protection within Microsoft 365. The foundation for creating these labels is known as Data Classification. Before organizations create sensitivity labels, they should first develop a Data Classification framework that provides the foundation upon which their sensitivity labels will later be built. Data Classification is a specialized term used in the fields of cybersecurity and information governance. It describes the process of identifying, categorizing, and protecting content according to its sensitivity or level of effect. In its most basic form, data classification is a means of protecting data from unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction based on how sensitive or impactful it is.

This module examines the importance of developing a Data Classification framework, the process of developing that framework, and the pain points that organizations experience when doing so. It also provides guidance on how to implement this framework to support the use of sensitivity labels.

With your Data Classification framework in place, you'll then learn how to create sensitivity labels and a label policy. The module will then examine how to publish labels, how to remove labels from a policy, and how to delete labels.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Create a plan for deploying sensitivity labels.
 -  Describe the requirements for creating sensitivity labels.
 -  Create and configure sensitivity labels.
 -  Publish sensitivity labels by creating a label policy.
 -  Identify the differences between removing and deleting sensitivity labels.
