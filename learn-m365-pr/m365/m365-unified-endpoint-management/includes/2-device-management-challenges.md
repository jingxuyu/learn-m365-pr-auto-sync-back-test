In today’s workplace, IT departments typically support a lot of devices that are configured in different ways. Mobile phones and tables may use Android and iOS operating systems, PCs might be using Windows 10 and macOS, and users might have their own customized devices outside of the configurations we just discussed. All of these devices must must be supported, and they must meet organizational standards of security and device health. In addition, IT professionals must be able to configure all of the various types of devices to support organizational apps and features, such as VPNs, email settings, and updates.

Laptops, tablets, or other mobile devices are the primary devices used in enterprise environments today. These devices present a unique set of management challenges to enterprise IT departments. A few common challenges include: 

**Mobile devices connecting to unsecured networks.** Mobile devices frequently connect to networks outside your organization. Organizational computers often connect to Wi-Fi access points in public places, like airports and cafés. Using Wi-Fi access points, hackers can capture network traffic and try to insert malware into your browsing sessions. This can impact everyone in your organization.

**Mobile devices intermittently connecting to organizational networks.** Mobile devices can be difficult to manage using tools such as Group Policy, which assumes devices are always connected to the organizational network.

**Backing up data.** When a device is connected to your organizational network, users are more likely to use documents in central locations, such as file shares and SharePoint sites. These locations are typically backed up. Mobile devices, including laptops, may not regularly connect and use content from central locations. This means the data is likely stored only on the device. If something happens to a device - like getting lost, stolen, or suffering a hardware failure - you might also lose your data, which can be frustrating and disruptive.

**Mobile devices more easily lost or stolen.** The average cost of replacing a stolen device can exceed the cost of the device. This cost is higher because your organization must configure the new device and determine what data was lost or stolen. In some cases, that data exists only on the mobile device, and is then lost to the organization.

**Compromised devices connect to the internal network.** A mobile device infected with malware can leak data, and introduce the malware into the organization. Organizations must treat mobile devices as possible malware carriers and take precautions to prevent leaks and attacks.

**Many mobile devices are user owned.** Personal devices are a challenge to organizations. IT departments need to find a balance between allowing access to applications and data with users wanting to use their own devices. When considering a mobile device support policy, ask the following questions:
- Is the device owned by the user or the organization?
- Should you let user-owned devices access sensitive applications and data? Or, only allow access if the owner agrees to have the device managed by IT?
- What actions can your organizations take to protect data stored on the device if the device is lost, or if the user leaves the company?

Mobile devices are more likely than larger devices (such as laptops) to be lost or stolen. This loss can mean that private and organization-specific data potentially becomes public. Organizations that allow mobile devices access to sensitive data must have policies in place to address these scenarios.
