You make and receive calls using a Teams Client. The Teams Client is an app that provides a graphical user interface for Teams. Microsoft provides the Teams Client app for the desktop running on Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as mobile devices running Android and iOS. A web client is also available. All clients provide similar functionality for making and placing calls.

## Make a call

You make a call from the **Calls** pane in the Teams Client.
The pane is split into three areas. The left-hand pane enables you to place a call to an external number using the keypad, or an internal call by specifying the name of a contact within your organization.

The middle pane provides a call history. You can filter this list to obtain a record of calls made to specific contacts or numbers.

The right-hand pane enables you to add speed dial icons.

## Record a conversation

Teams Client enables the meeting owner (usually the person that started the call) to record a conversation. Other members of a team can replay this recording if they were unable to be present for a call.

Teams can generate captions in real time, using voice recognition algorithms. A profanity filter detects and removes cuss words. The text is displayed at the bottom of the Teams pane. This service is currently only available for English.

The captions aren't saved. Captioning has to be enabled by a user in the conversation. An administrator can set Teams meeting policy controls to determine whether users can create captions for meetings.

You can also create a full transcription of a meeting. The text appears in the Transcription pane, and is annotated with the identity of the speaker. The meeting owner can download, edit, and distribute the transcript when the meeting has finished.

## Transfer a call to another client

A key facet of Teams Calling is mobility. The Teams Client is available on multiple devices, and the same user can connect to Teams from any device that has authenticated access to Teams in your organization.

Additionally, you can transfer a call from once device to another. For example, you can start participating in a call using your desktop in the office, and then transfer the call to your mobile phone if you need to continue while on the move. Call transfer is seamless, and does not cause any interruptions to other participants.
