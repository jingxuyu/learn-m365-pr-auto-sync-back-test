The Steps Recorder tool can be a useful diagnostic tool for visually recording the steps that lead to a problem. You can load the Steps Recorder tool from **Start** in the **Windows Accessories** folder in **All apps**. To record steps, in the Steps Recorder tool, select **Start Record**. Then, perform the necessary steps to reproduce a particular problem. When you finish, select **Stop Record**. You then can save the recording. Saving the recording creates an MHTML file (stored in a zipped format) that you can later analyze to see the steps involved in a particular procedure. Aside from troubleshooting, you also can use the recorded steps to demonstrate particular procedures for your users.
