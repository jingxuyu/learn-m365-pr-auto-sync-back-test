Microsoft Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) identifies the most significant risks for Microsoft and provides a consistent risk management approach across the organization. ERM includes a formal risk management methodology, which includes defined roles and responsibilities, provides continuous input, and supports timely decisions to mitigate risks. Highly visible senior leadership support and involvement ensure accountability and underscore Microsoft’s commitment to managing enterprise risks effectively.

ERM performs a semi-annual Enterprise Risk Assessment to evaluate risk across Microsoft. The process begins with identification of company opportunities, aspirations, and commitments. With these in mind, the assessment proceeds to identify the most significant risks to Microsoft’s objectives. This analysis includes an assessment of the operating environment, including internal risk assessments from business units and external factors such as competition and the regulatory landscape. The Enterprise Risk Assessment also considers historic data such as previous audits and assessments. Additionally, Microsoft leverages knowledge and feedback from industry groups, forums, and peer reviews to develop a broad picture of the external risk environment.

The risk assessment process includes discussion and engagement across the entire organization, involving Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), Corporate VPs, and senior leaders. These stakeholders provide feedback on identified risks to ensure they accurately represent the risk posture of Microsoft. The output of the risk assessment process includes a final Enterprise Risk Management report that captures the opinion of Microsoft senior leadership.
