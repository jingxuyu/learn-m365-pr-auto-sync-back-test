Email is one of the most pervasive and powerful forms of communication and collaboration. It’s also the most prolific attack vector that we see today. Emails can compromise users and penetrate organizations. The most common way attackers use emails to breach your organization includes:

- **Spam**
   - Malicious or unsolicited mail sent to a mailbox without the option to unsubscribe
   - Often used as a catch-all for any undesired or questionable mail
- **Bulk**
   - An email sent to a large list of recipients for promotional purposes. Typically, the sender has a reputation with us.
   - Good: Recipient intentionally signed up to receive emails for newsletters or promotions. Reputable ones provide the option to unsubscribe.
   - Bad: Recipient didn’t sign up to receive emails. Sometimes they provide the option to unsubscribe. 
- **Phishing**
   - An attack on a group of mailboxes with the intention of garnering personal information or credentials
   - Spear phishing: a targeted attempt at a specific user (typically a high-profile user or admin) or organization
- **Malware**
   - Malicious code often distributed in email to a recipient; for example, spyware, key loggers, and RAM scrapers.
   - Payload can be delivered as an attachment or URL.

Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is an email filtering service that provides additional protection on top of existing Exchange Online Protection. ATP helps protect against unknown malware and viruses and provides better zero-day protection to safeguard your messaging system. ATP includes:

- **Threat protection policies** - Define threat-protection policies to set the appropriate level of protection for your organization.
- **Reports** - View real-time reports to monitor ATP performance in your organization.
- **Threat investigation and response capabilities** - Use leading-edge tools to investigate, understand, simulate, and prevent threats.
- **Automated investigation and response capabilities** - Save time and effort investigating and mitigating threats.

ATP anti-phishing applies a set of machine learning models together with impersonation detection algorithms to incoming messages to provide protection for commodity and spear phishing attacks. ATP anti-phishing protects your organization according to policies that are set by your global or security administrators.

Other ATP features include:

- **Safe Attachments** - Protect against unknown malware and viruses by opening attachments in cordoned-off virtual environments to detect malicious behavior.
- **Safe Links** - Provide real-time, time-of-click protection against malicious URLs by wrapping external links in special URLs that check the destination URL for threats before opening them.
- **Click Trace** - Provides rich reporting and URL trace capabilities by keeping a record of every user who has clicked on a Safe Link-wrapped URL for additional protection.
