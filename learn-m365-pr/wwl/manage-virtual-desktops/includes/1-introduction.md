Virtual Desktops, as opposed to physical desktops, are becoming more popular for solving challenges related to providing remote access to resources. Microsoft provides solutions such as Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Azure Virtual Desktops (AVD) are typically configured by an Azure Administrator. Windows 365 desktops, while built on the same fundamentals as AVD, can be set up and configured without Azure Administrator experience. In either case, both virtual desktop platforms can be managed using the same methods as physical desktops.

### Objectives

 -  Describe the differences between Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365
