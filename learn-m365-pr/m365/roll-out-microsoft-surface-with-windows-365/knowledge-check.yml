quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "You have some proprietary design software that you need to make available to your 10-strong design team, but don't want it to be installed natively on their computers. To improve collaboration, they also require access to all their regular tools, such as email and Teams. What solution would enable this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a server and allow all users to access it via remote desktop"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While you can configure the server to accept multiple remote desktop connections, this is not a robust solution."
    - content: "Provide a VPN to a server where the application can be run remotely"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You would not use a VPN to access a computer remotely."
    - content: "Use a Windows 365 Cloud PC with the required software installed, and grant the user access"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If you create a Cloud PC for each user in the design team, they can access the resources they need and work collaboratively without any change in working practices."
  - content: "Which tool would you use to manage your organization's Surface devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Endpoint Manager"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft Endpoint Manager brings together all the tools to manage your Surface devices in one place."
    - content: "Windows 365 portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Windows 365 portal controls access to a Windows 365 Cloud PC. It would not be used to manage Surface devices."
    - content: "Azure Active Directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Among other things, Microsoft Azure Active Directory is responsible for managing identity and conditional access. It's not responsible for the direct management of Surface devices."
  - content: "Microsoft Endpoint Manager unifies device management and control by bringing together four services: Microsoft InTune, Configuration Manager, Azure Active Directory, and what other service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Windows 365 Cloud PC"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While you can provision and deploy Windows 365 Cloud PCs using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, it's not one of the core services."
    - content: "Windows Autopilot"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Windows Autopilot is essential in the provision and management of Surface and other devices."
    - content: "Windows 365 Endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A Windows 365 endpoint represents a virtual machine running on a network. It's not a core service of Microsoft Endpoint Manager."
