title: Optimize network traffic with Microsoft Graph
summary: Microsoft Graph provides a unified programmability model that you can use to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with the data of millions of users. In this module, students will learn how Microsoft has implemented throttling to Microsoft Graph to limit the overuse of Microsoft Graph resources. Students will learn how to avoid requests from being throttled, and how to properly handle scenarios when Microsoft Graph throttles high user traffic in a graceful way.
