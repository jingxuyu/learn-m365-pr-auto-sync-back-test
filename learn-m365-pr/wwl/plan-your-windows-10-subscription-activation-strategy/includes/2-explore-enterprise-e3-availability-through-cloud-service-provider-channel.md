Windows 10 Enterprise E3 is available through a subscription-based model and delivers Windows 10 Enterprise edition features. In a subscription-based model, you pay a monthly fee for using Windows 10. You also don’t need to buy them before you can start using them. This offering is available through the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) channel through the Partner Center as an online service. Windows 10 Enterprise E3 in CSP provides a flexible, per-user subscription for small- and medium-sized companies. It ranges from one to hundreds of users.

To take advantage of this Windows 10 Enterprise E3 offering, organizations must meet the following prerequisites:

 -  **Devices must include Windows 10 Pro, version 1607 (also known as Windows 10 Anniversary Update) or later.** Windows 10 Enterprise E3 is available only as an upgrade. Therefore, each device must have a previously installed Windows 10 operating system.
 -  **Use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity management.** Windows 10 devices must be joined to Azure AD or on-premises AD DS, which is synced to Azure AD.

Starting with Windows 10, version 1607 (Windows 10 Anniversary Update), you can upgrade from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise easier than ever before. There are no longer any keys or reboots. An organization just needs to assign a Windows 10 Enterprise E3 license to its Azure AD users or groups by using the Azure portal or the Microsoft 365 Admin portal.

Then, when a user signs in by using Azure AD credentials associated with a Windows 10 Enterprise E3 license:

 -  the operating system upgrades automatically from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise.
 -  All the appropriate Windows 10 Enterprise features are unlocked.

When a subscription license expires or is transferred to another user, the Windows 10 Enterprise device seamlessly steps back down to Windows 10 Pro.

When an organization purchases Windows 10 Enterprise E3 through a CSP partner, it receives the following benefits:

 -  **Windows 10 Enterprise edition**. Windows 10 can use either the Semi-Annual or Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) servicing channel. Windows 10 Enterprise E3 doesn't include rights to use the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC).
 -  **Support from one to hundreds of users**. Although the Windows 10 Enterprise E3 in CSP program doesn't have a limitation on the number of licenses that a company can use, the offering is designed for small- and medium-sized companies.
 -  **Deploy on up to five devices**. For each user covered by the Windows 10 Enterprise E3 license, the user can deploy and use Windows 10 Enterprise edition on up to five devices.
 -  **Roll back to Windows 10 Pro at any time**. When a user’s subscription expires or Windows 10 Enterprise E3 license is transferred to another user, the Windows 10 Enterprise device reverts seamlessly to Windows 10 Pro edition, after a grace period of up to 90 days.
 -  **Monthly, per-user pricing model**. Organizations pay a monthly fee for using Windows 10. They don’t need to purchase Windows 10 before they can start using it. This monthly, per-user pricing model makes Windows 10 Enterprise E3 affordable for any company.
 -  **Move licenses between users**. Licenses can be quickly and easily reallocated between Azure AD users within an organization. This design enables the company to optimize its licensing investment against changing needs.

Windows 10 Enterprise includes all the features that are included in Windows 10 Pro. It also includes the following extra features:

 -  Credential Guard
 -  Device Guard
 -  AppLocker management
 -  Application Virtualization (App-V)
 -  User Experience Virtualization (UE-V)
