Conforming to industry and governmental regulations is critical to the successful operation of any organization. This module explores the tools Microsoft 365 provides to help ensure an organization's regulatory compliance. The focus of this module is on the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. It specifically examines the Compliance Manager tool and the Microsoft compliance score.

The following statistics reflect the challenges faced by organizations in today's working environment:

 -  140+ days between infiltration and detection.
 -  4.2 billion records compromised in the last year.
 -  50% of employee time is spent in collaborative work environment,
 -  78% of employees use mobile devices for work.
 -  50% year-over-year growth in electronic data.
 -  45% of organizations lack data governance, leaving them open to litigation and data security risks.
 -  87% of senior managers admit to using personal accounts for work.
 -  88% of organizations are no longer confident they detect and prevent loss of sensitive data.

Organizations traditionally had their own networks, each of which was protected by a firewall. This design enabled them to protect the data, devices, and users within their networks. As technology has evolved, many organizations have implemented hybrid environments, with data being stored on-premises and in the cloud. Organizations are increasingly using cloud applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365 and Azure. They also have users external to their networks who use different devices to access that data. So the challenge for organizations today is to protect that information, and protect the devices and users that aren't connected to their networks.

In this module, you'll examine how Microsoft 365 addresses these challenges to information protection and governance. Its approach provides comprehensive policies to protect and govern an organizations' most important data, throughout its life cycle. The center of compliance in Microsoft 365 is the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. And from a practical, day to day tracking of compliance status, organizations use the Compliance Manager dashboard.

This module examines how Compliance Manager helps simplify compliance and reduce risk by using:

 -  Pre-built assessments for common industry and regional standards and regulations.
 -  Custom assessments to meet your unique compliance needs.
 -  Workflow capabilities to help you efficiently complete your risk assessments through a single tool.
 -  Detailed step-by-step guidance on suggested improvement actions to help you comply with the standards and regulations that are most relevant for your organization.
 -  A risk-based compliance score to help you understand your compliance posture by measuring your progress in completing improvement actions.
