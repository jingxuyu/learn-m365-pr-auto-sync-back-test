At Contoso Electronics, you recognized a need to organize document libraries and to improve content understanding. You developed a proposal for using SharePoint Syntex to streamline content understanding processes and to help make the case for leadership buy-in.

You began by understanding how form processing and document understanding models could work for different types of documents within the organization.

You identified the necessary SharePoint Syntex roles such as SharePoint/Knowledge admin, Power Platform admin, knowledge manager, and model owner. With the roles identified, you then shopped your presentation to the stakeholders within your organization. By putting together a thoughtful Sharepoint Syntex strategy for one business unit, you supported the business case for the adoption of SharePoint Syntex throughout the organization.
