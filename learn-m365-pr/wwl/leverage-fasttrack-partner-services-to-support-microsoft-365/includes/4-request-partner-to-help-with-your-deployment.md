If an organization is looking for a partner to assist it with the FastTrack process, it should begin by accessing the [I’m looking for a solution provider](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home?azure-portal=true) website.

To locate a solution provider, the organization should enter its city, organization size, and the services, skills, or products it needs assistance with. The website will then display a list of partner candidates that it can choose from. Each partner will be broken down in categories. Once an organization has made its selection, the partner will contact it and start the onboarding process.

When the onboarding process is complete, the partner’s information will be displayed in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Navigate to the **Partner Services** tab, which is located under the **Settings** tab in the left-hand navigation pane.
