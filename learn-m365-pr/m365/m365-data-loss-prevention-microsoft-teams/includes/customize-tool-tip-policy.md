Account information: For all of the walkthroughs in this module, you'll need to open a browser and connect to <https://compliance.microsoft.com/homepage> using your admin credentials.

If you're working with content that conflicts with a DLP policy, a policy tip can be presented to help the user understand and resolve the conflict.

To perform this task, you must be assigned a role that has permissions to edit DLP policies. Members of your compliance team who will create DLP policies need permissions to the Security & Compliance Center. By default, your tenant admin will have access to this location and can give compliance officers and other people access to the Security & Compliance Center, without giving them all of the permissions of a tenant admin. To do this, we recommend:

1. Create a group in Microsoft 365 and add compliance officers to it.
1. Create a role group on the Permissions page of the Security & Compliance Center.
1. While creating the role group, use the Choose Roles section to add the following role to the Role Group: DLP Compliance Management.
1. Use the Choose Members section to add the Microsoft 365 group you created before to the role group.

You can also create a role group with view-only privileges to the DLP policies and DLP reports by granting the View-Only DLP Compliance Management role.

These permissions are required only to create and apply a DLP policy. Policy enforcement does not require access to the content.
