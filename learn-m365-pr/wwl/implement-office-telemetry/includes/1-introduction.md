This module examines Office Telemetry, which assesses the way an organization uses its Office products. Telemetry collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and products used in an organization. This data is stored in a central database for reporting and viewing. By analyzing the collected data, you can make informed choices of versions and products that are needed by the users in your organization.

In this module, you'll learn about the Office Telemetry Dashboard. The dashboard is an on-premises tool that collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and solutions used in your organization. Data collected for the Office Telemetry Dashboard is different than Office diagnostic data, which can be sent to Microsoft. The settings used to manage the Office Telemetry Dashboard have no impact on Office diagnostic data.

This module examines the five components of the Office Telemetry Dashboard and the role each plays in collecting and analyzing your organization's Office data. You'll also learn about the basic Telemetry process, including the prerequisites that must be in place before collection can begin. To assist you with your Office Telemetry planning, you'll learn about the typical Telemetry deployment requirements and issues that you need to consider.

The module concludes by examining the data that is collected by the Telemetry Agent, and how to install and configure Office Telemetry.

 *  Identify the five components of the Office Telemetry Dashboard
 *  Describe the typical deployment requirements and issues when deploying Office Telemetry
