With Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, you can take advantage of reports that will help you understand the threat and vulnerability landscape, the health of your devices, and whether your devices are compliant with your organization's security requirements.

Here, you'll learn about the threat protection report, the vulnerable devices report, and the device health and compliance report.

## What is the threat protection report?

You use the threat protection report to view information about alerts across your organization at a high level. Use it to access trending information based on alert attributes such as:

- **Alerts severity**
  - Indicates the level of potential impact of threats to your organization. Helps you to prioritize critical alerts.
- **Classifications**
  - Describes how you've classified alerts when resolving them. For example, whether they've been classified as true alerts (actual threats) or false alerts (incorrect detections).
- **Detection sources**
  - Information about the detection sensors and sources that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint has used to trigger alerts.
- **Threat categories**
  - Information about the types of threats (such as malware, ransomware, and more) that have been associated with alerts across your organization.

You can find the threat protection report by selecting **Reports** in the Microsoft 365 Security Center portal navigation pane, and then selecting **Threat Protection**:

The threat protection report consists of two sections, these are **alert trends** and **alert status**:

- **Alert trends**
  - Alert trends is where you'll find trending information about your alerts mapped over time. You use it to view information such as classification of alerts, status of alerts, and more. By default, it displays information from the last 30 days, but you can change the range from anywhere between 30 days to any custom period of time of your choosing.
- **Alert status**
  - The alert status section shows the same information about alerts that is available in the trends section, but scoped to the current day. Use it to get an overview of the current state of threats across your environment.

### Filter the threat protection report

To meet your organization's threat reporting requirements, you can filter the threat protection report according to your needs, such as based on threat category, severity levels, detection sources, and more:

## What is the vulnerable devices report?

You use the vulnerable devices report to gain insights into the vulnerability of devices across your organization. Use the report to access information such as:

- **Device vulnerability severity levels**
  - A mapping of vulnerability severity for your endpoints. You use it to prioritize devices that have critical vulnerabilities.
- **Device exploit availability**
  - Information on devices that have vulnerabilities that are susceptible to verified exploits.
- **Device vulnerability age**
  - Older vulnerabilities have a higher chance of being exploited. Use it to track older vulnerabilities, and improve the average remediation time for your devices.
- **Vulnerable devices by operating system**
  - Information on how vulnerabilities have been discovered for your devices based on the different operating systems in your environment.

You can find the vulnerable devices report by selecting Reports in the navigation pane, and then selecting Vulnerable devices:

The vulnerable devices report consists of two sections, these are **Trends** and **Status**:

:::image type="content" source="../media/1-vulnerable-devices-report-dashboard-inline.png" lightbox="../media/1-vulnerable-devices-report-dashboard-expanded.png" alt-text="Vulnerable devices report.":::

- **Trends**
  - The trends section is where you'll find trending information about your vulnerabilities mapped over time. Use it to view information such as vulnerable devices over time, vulnerability severity, emergence of exploits over time, and more. By default it displays information from the last 30 days, but you can change the range from anywhere between 30 days to any custom period of time of your choosing.
- **Status**
  - Use the status section to view the same information about vulnerabilities as in the trends section, but scoped to the current day. Use it to get an overview of the current state of vulnerabilities across your environment.

### Filter the vulnerable devices report

To meet your organization's vulnerability reporting requirements, you can filter the report according to your needs, such as based on vulnerability age, severity levels, operating systems, and more:

## What is the device health and compliance report?

You use the device health and compliance report to review high-level information about the overall health of your devices, and how they're holding up to your organization's compliance needs. You use it to view device attributes such as:

- **Sensor health state**
  - For example, how many sensors are inactive, have impaired communications, or have provided no sensor data.
- **Antivirus status**
  - For example, which devices have had their antivirus protection disabled, or not updated.
- **OS platform**
  - For example, how many devices are running Windows 10, compared with Linux, or macOS.
- **Windows 10 version**
  - For Windows, you can also see how many devices are running each different version of Windows 10, which allows you to see how many devices are not compliant because they're lagging behind in updates.

You can find the health and compliance report by selecting **Reports** in the navigation pane, and then selecting **Device health and compliance**:

The health and compliance report consists of two sections, **device trends** and **device summary**:

:::image type="content" source="../media/1-device-health-report-dashboard.png" alt-text="Device health and compliance report.":::

- **Device trends**
  - You use the device trends section to find information about the health and compliance of your devices over time. For example, you can track information such as the sensor health status, antivirus status of your devices, and more. By default, it displays information from the last 30 days, but you can change the range from anywhere between 30 days to any custom period of time of your choosing.
- **Device summary**
  - Use the device summary section to view the same information as the device trends section, but scoped to the current day. Use it get an overview of the current state of health and compliance of your devices.

### Filter the health and compliance report

To meet your organization's device health and compliance reporting requirements, you can filter the report according to your needs, including based on sensor health, Windows 10 versions, antivirus protection status, and more:
