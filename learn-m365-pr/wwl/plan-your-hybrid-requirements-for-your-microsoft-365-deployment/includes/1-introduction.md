This module examines how to successfully plan an organization's hybrid needs and begin the integration process. To do so, you'll examine the key areas that organizations must plan for to create hybrid environments for Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business.

Creating a hybrid environment involves connecting your existing on-premises services, such as Exchange and Active Directory, with corresponding services that are housed in the Cloud. Each on-premises service and its corresponding cloud service creates a trust connection and allows information to flow freely between both environments, as shown in the following diagram.
