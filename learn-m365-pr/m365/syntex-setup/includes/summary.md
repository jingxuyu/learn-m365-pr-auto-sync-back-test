To better support Human Resources' document understanding and compliance maintenance, Contoso Electronics took part in a staged rollout of SharePoint Syntex. Your project team selected the Human Resources department's content library as the first target. To ensure document confidentiality, you chose to create a content center dedicated to just Human Resources content, which you named _"Contoso Electronics Human Resources content center"_. You worked alongside the Human Resources management team to set up SharePoint Syntex on the Human Resources SharePoint library.

When we think about the experience with SharePoint Syntex, your organization, Contoso Electronics, made a smart decision by focusing on one department first when enabling SharePoint Syntex. The Human Resources department created a centralized location for form processing and document understanding models, allowing them to configure the models to their specific needs. With SharePoint Syntex configured, Contoso Electronics Human Resources can now spend less time on maintaining document compliance and more time supporting initiatives that add value to Contoso Electronics as a whole.
