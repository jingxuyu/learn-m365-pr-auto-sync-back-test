This module examined how Microsoft provides built-in policy templates within Microsoft 365 to help organizations get started with implementing DLP policies. While policy templates provide an efficient starting point for creating DLP policies, some businesses require custom policies that are more aligned with their unique requirements. There are several things an organization can do to customize a policy based on a built-in template, such as:

 -  Changing the content locations
 -  Adding a new rule
 -  Deleting a rule
 -  Editing a rule

Organizations can also create a custom policy from scratch.

In this module, you followed along in the process of customizing a policy created with a policy template. This process edited one of the policyâ€™s rules. You learned that the process of editing an existing rule and the process of adding a new rule are similar, since both procedures configure the following properties:

 -  Name
 -  Conditions
 -  Exceptions
 -  Actions
 -  User notifications
 -  User overrides
 -  Incident reports

User notifications, user overrides, and sending incident reports can also be considered actions. There were examined in separate units within this module.

This module examined the entire workflow to create a DLP policy. You learned how to modify existing rules within DLP policies and how to add and modify custom conditions and action to a DLP rule. You also learned how to change user notifications and policy tips. This module also provided instruction on how to configure the user override option to a DLP rule. The module concluded with an introduction to incident reports that are sent when a DLP rule violation occurs.
