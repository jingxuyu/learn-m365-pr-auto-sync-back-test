Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is a cloud-based email filtering service. It provides anti-malware and anti-spam policies to protect organizations against spam and malware. EOP includes features to safeguard organizations from messaging policy violations.

This module will introduce you to EOP features and functionality. You'll also learn about the primary ways in which EOP can be used for messaging protection.
