Co-management enables organizations to use modern management features with their current devices. These features include Conditional Access and strong authentication by using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). There are two ways to prepare your existing environment for Co-management:

 -  **If an organization's devices are currently managed by Configuration Manager, but not yet by Intune, it must enroll them to Intune.** Depending on the company's size, it can achieve this goal in several different ways. For example, it can use provisioning packages, manual enrollment, or enrolling them by using Configuration Manager.
 -  **If an organization's devices are currently managed by Intune, but not yet by Configuration Manager, it must install the Configuration Manager client on the devices.** Organizations can install the client in several different ways. For example, they can use Intune app deployment or manual installation.

The following diagram compares the components of traditional device management with the components of modern device management such as Co-management.

New devices can include the Configuration Manager client. They can automatically be enrolled to Intune during the deployment. Integrating Configuration Manager and Intune forms the basis of Co-management.

In this module, you'll examine how to prepare your Windows 10 and later devices for Co-management. You'll begin by exploring the prerequisites for using Co-management. You'll then learn how to configure Configuration Manager for Co-management. The module will then conclude by showing you how to enroll your Windows 10 and later devices to Intune.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the prerequisites for using Co-management.
 -  Configure Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for Co-management.
 -  Enroll Windows 10 and later devices to Intune.
 -  Modify your co-management settings.
 -  Transfer workload management from Configuration Manager to Microsoft Intune.
