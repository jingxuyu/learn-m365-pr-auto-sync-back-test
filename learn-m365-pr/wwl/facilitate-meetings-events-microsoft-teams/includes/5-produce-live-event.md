## Produce a live event

Before you go live, let's get everything set up with your Teams live event. The producer’s screen has three areas. What’s live is on the right side. On the left, the **Queue** shows you what’s next, and the bottom tray has all content you can share.

## Producer capabilities

Teams live events provide flexible options for event producers:

 *  If you want to broadcast a Teams meeting, bringing remote presenters and screen sharing into the event, you can produce your live event in Teams.
 *  If you’re running an event with a production crew, you can use an external app or device to produce your event. This method is powered by Microsoft Stream.
