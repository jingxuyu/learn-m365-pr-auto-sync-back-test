In the previous unit, we reviewed how companies have the option to work solely in the cloud or to connect existing on-premises systems to the cloud to extend the value of their legacy infrastructure. These two different service models require different approaches to migration.

For example, if a smaller company has a free, web-based mail service and decides to change to the more productive and secure email that Microsoft 365 provides, they’ll need to migrate all their users’ email accounts from the free online service to Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. After that migration, users access their old email and inboxes through Outlook, and the data is stored in Exchange Online; there is nothing left in the old system to use. We use the term migration in this context to emphasize how everything is moved (or migrated) from the old to the new with the intent of removing the old system once the migration is complete.

If, however, a company wants to create a hybrid environment where their new Microsoft 365 subscription will extend their existing Microsoft Exchange servers, then they configure coexistence, linking the on-premises Windows Server Active Directory and Exchange Server to their online Azure Active Directory and Exchange Online counterparts. We use the term coexistence in this situation to emphasize how two different systems—one on-premises, and the other in the cloud—connect and work together at the same time (or coexist) as a single service (such as email).

## Migration considerations
|What you need to migrate|Strategies/considerations|
|-|-|
|Office client to Office 365 ProPlus|Reasons to upgrade to Microsoft 365 licenses: <br><br>After Oct 2020, accessing Office 365 services (like Exchange Online, SharePoint) won't be supported if you're using Office 2013.<br><br>  
Office 2010 is only supported until 2020 and Office 2007 isn’t supported at all.| 
|Office Server versions to equivalent Office 365 services|	Reasons to upgrade to Office 365 services:<br><br>
Office Server 2013 and Office Server 2016 products (like Exchange Server and SharePoint Server) don’t take advantage of the cloud-based services and enhancements.<br><br>Some Office Server 2010 products have a specified end-of-support date.<br><br>Office Server 2007 products are no longer supported. To help with migration from this version, hire a Microsoft partner. You can then roll out the new functionality and work processes to your users and decommission the on-premises servers running Office 2007 server products when you no longer need them.|
|Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on your devices to Windows 10 Enterprise|	Perform an in-place upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise.|


All of these migrations bring your organization closer to the modern workplace: a secure and integrated environment that unlocks teamwork and creativity in your organization through Microsoft 365.
