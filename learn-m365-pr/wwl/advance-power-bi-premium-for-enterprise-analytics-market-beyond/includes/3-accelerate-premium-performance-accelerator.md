Power BI Premium provides enhanced performance on any capacity size, anytime: Analytics operations will run up to 16X faster. Operations will always perform at top speed and will not slow down when the load on the capacity approaches the capacity limits.  Performance levels are guaranteed and are based on the number of v-cores, or CPU cycles. Memory is not even a consideration, apart from per-dataset overall size limits, as memory is allocated as needed. The CPU charge for query refreshes will be allocated immediately, but the usage allocation will be spread out throughout the day. This method provides consistent fast performance without requiring resource overallocation to handle peaks due to resourcing.
