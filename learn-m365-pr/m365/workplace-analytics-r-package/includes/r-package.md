An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of R. R packages allow you to take advantage of visualization capabilities, machine learning, and data wrangling, and are key to success with R. At the time of this writing, over 17,000 R packages are listed on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). There are even more on GitHub.

The `wpa` R package is a set of tools and functions to analyze and visualize data from Viva Insights through the Workplace Analytics app.
