Microsoft Teams is core to Microsoft's vision for intelligent communications. It brings together conversations, meetings, files, Office apps, and third-party integrations to provide a single hub for teamwork in Microsoft 365. To achieve its vision for intelligent communications, Microsoft has designed comprehensive calling and meetings capabilities into Teams, along with data and insights from the Microsoft Graph, and a strong roadmap of innovation to empower teams to achieve more.

The Microsoft Teams design is built on a new, modern infrastructure for enterprise-grade voice and video communications. Microsoft's next generation, cloud-born architecture is already powering communication experiences in Microsoft Teams, and is evolving rapidly. Teams provides both speed of innovation and higher-quality communication experiences.

Teams has evolved into the primary client for intelligent communications in Microsoft 365, replacing the Skype for Business client.
