This module introduced you to sensitivity labels and how Microsoft 365 uses them to help protect sensitive data. So why the need for sensitivity labels? Well, to get their work done, people in an organization collaborate with others both inside and outside the organization. By doing so, content no longer stays behind a firewall. It can roam everywhere, across devices, apps, and services. And when it roams, it should do so in a secure, protected way that meets its organization's business and compliance policies.

This module explored how sensitivity labels in Microsoft Purview Information Protection solutions let you classify and protect your organization's data, while making sure that user productivity and their ability to collaborate isn't hindered.

All Microsoft Purview Information Protection solutions are implemented by using sensitivity labels. You learned in this module how create and configure the sensitivity labels that you want to make available for apps and other services.
