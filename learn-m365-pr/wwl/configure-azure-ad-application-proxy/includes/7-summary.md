In this module, you learned how to configure Azure AD Application Proxy. Azure AD Application Proxy supports remote workers by publishing on-premises applications that will be accessed over the internet. These applications can be published through the Azure portal to provide secure remote access from outside your network. This module examined the benefits of using Application Proxy to publish your local applications. It also reviewed the types of applications that work with Application Proxy, and how Application Proxy works.

This module also examined the role that connectors play in making Azure AD Application Proxy possible. You learned about the installation and maintenance of connectors and the benefits of creating connector groups.


Finally, the module provided instruction on how to publish an on-premises app for remote access. You also learned that once the app is published, you must verify the app is functioning properly by adding a test user and then testing the published app.
