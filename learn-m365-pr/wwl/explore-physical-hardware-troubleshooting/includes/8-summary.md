Physical hardware failure symptoms can sometimes be the result of driver failure. When drivers are applied manually, failure can arise because the incorrect driver was used, or is incompatible with the OS version. Like applications, sometimes the driver itself may have bugs. USB devices are the most common type of device connected by end users. They provide convenience but also potential security risks. Group Policy can be used to restrict what devices can be attached. Attaching devices via wireless connection is also commonly used, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. When troubleshooting hardware issues, use the Event Viewer and Device Manager to help identify the underlying issue.
