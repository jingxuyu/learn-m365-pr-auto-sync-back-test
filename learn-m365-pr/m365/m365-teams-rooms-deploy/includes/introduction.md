**Deploy Microsoft Teams Rooms** covers a few different disciplines. You’ll  learn how you can standardize Teams Rooms deployments to simplify the distribution of Teams Rooms across your environment. This includes standardizing on things like shipping, components, and logistics.

You’ll learn how the various components of Teams Rooms connect with one another. How does a table microphone connect to the compute module? How do simple room configurations differ from complex room configurations?

We’ll look at the resource account. The resource account is the account that represents the meeting room in Microsoft Teams. When you invite a room to a meeting, it's really the resource account that you're inviting. Beyond just learning how to create this account, you’ll learn how to customize it using features such as Places and additional responses.
