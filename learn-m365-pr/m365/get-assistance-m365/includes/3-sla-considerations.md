Although the cloud has much to offer, it’s not unlike any other network, server, or on-premises service, where an unforeseen problem or disaster can cause the service to be unavailable. Therefore, before signing any service agreement between your organization and the cloud provider, thoroughly review the SLA. 

When reviewing the agreement, ask yourself the following questions:

- How does the CSP determine whether service levels are being achieved?
- Who is responsible for measurement, and how can I obtain reports?
- What exceptions are there in the SLA?
- When the SLA is not met, what’s the remedy for the deficiencies?
- What happens when maintenance (both scheduled and emergency) is performed?
- What happens when a malicious hacker targets my organizations or the infrastructure that we’re running on, and the result is downtime? 
- What happens when third-party system failures or services are not under the vendor’s control?
- What happens if the service is brought down by acts of war or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, storms, tornadoes, or hurricanes?
- What limits to the CSP’s liability are stated in the SLA?
