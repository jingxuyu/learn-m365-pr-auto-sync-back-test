Business units and product groups at Microsoft are responsible for specific implementations of Microsoft security policies, standards, and requirements. Microsoft 365 documents security implementations in the Microsoft 365 Information Security Policy. This policy aligns with the Microsoft Security Policy and governs the Microsoft 365 information system, including all Microsoft 365 environments and all resources involved in the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, and disposal of data.

## Scope

The purpose of the Microsoft 365 Information Security Policy is to enable Microsoft 365 to operate according to best practices, achieve the corporate objective of building and maintaining customer trust, complying with regulatory requirements and customer commitments, and supporting public promises with respect to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Microsoft 365 services.

The Microsoft 365 information system includes the following components governed by the Microsoft 365 Information Security Policy

- Infrastructure: The physical and hardware components of Microsoft 365 systems (facilities, equipment, and networks)
- Software: The programs and operating software of Microsoft 365 systems (systems, applications, and utilities)
- People: The personnel involved in the operation and use of Microsoft 365 systems (developers, operators, users, and managers)
- Procedures: The programmed and manual procedures involved in the operation of Microsoft 365 systems
- Data: The information generated, collected, and processed by Microsoft 365 systems (transaction streams, files, databases, and tables)

All Microsoft 365 information system components are governed by the Microsoft 365 Information Security Policy.

## Microsoft 365 Control Framework

The Microsoft 365 Information Security Policy is supplemented by the Microsoft 365 Control Framework. The Microsoft 365 Control Framework details the minimum-security requirements for all Microsoft 365 services and information system components, and references the legal and corporate requirements behind each control. The framework includes control activity names, descriptions, and guidance to ensure effective control implementations by service teams. Microsoft 365 uses the control framework to track evidence of control implementations for internal and external reporting.

The Control Framework consists of 18 objectives in the following key domain areas:

- Access Control (AC)
- Awareness and Training (AT)
- Audit and Accountability (AU)
- Security Assessment (CA)
- Configuration Management (CM)
- Contingency Planning (CP)
- Identification and Authentication (IA)
- Incident Response (IR)
- Maintenance (MA)
- Media Protection (MP)
- Physical Access (PE)
- Security Planning (PL)
- Program Management (PM)
- Personnel Security (PS)
- Risk Assessment (RA)
- System and Services Acquisition (SA)
- System and Communications Protection (SC)
- System and Information Integrity (SI)

## Exception process

All exceptions to the Microsoft 365 Information Security Policy must have a legitimate business justification and be approved by an appropriate governance entity within Microsoft 365. Exceptions must also have service team management approval and be documented in the Microsoft 365 risk management tool. Depending on the scope of the exception and the potential risk it represents, approval for exceptions may need to be obtained from a corporate vice president or higher. Exceptions are entered into the Microsoft 365 risk management tool, where they are reviewed and approved for continued relevance.
