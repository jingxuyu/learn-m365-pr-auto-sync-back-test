Threat protection starts with reducing the overall attack surface, helping prevent attacks in the first place. Reduce the number of places where attackers can find a way into the system, network, or an endpoint. This means filtering out malicious code and links before they ever reach a user. By intercepting threats in mail or document sharing, and detecting unusual operating system behaviors, you can help isolate users from attacks.

But when an attack occurs, security teams need to detect and block them quickly. Preventing attacks is part of the story, but security teams need to be able detect and respond breaches. Itâ€™s not a matter of if, but when a company will be breached. And security teams need to be prepared with the right tools. Microsoft 365 provides unique capabilities to help here, such as our ability to detect memory and kernel-based attacks on endpoints. 

In the event of a breach, security teams need to respond quickly to contain the damage and prevent further infection. Large organizations need to review and triage incoming issues easily and Microsoft 365 security features supporting incident management and alerts can help security teams respond to issues more quickly.  The automated investigation and remediation capability leverages various inspection algorithms and processes used by analysts to significantly reduce alert volume and help prevent the spread of an attack, allowing security teams to better investigate and analyze the issue. 
Microsoft Threat Protection is backed by the intelligent security graph, a vast collection of signals and insights that helps Microsoft protect its customers.
