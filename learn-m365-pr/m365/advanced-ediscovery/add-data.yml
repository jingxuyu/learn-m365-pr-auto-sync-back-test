  description: eDiscovery offers built-in tools such as Content Search to help identify data used as evidence in legal cases. Content Search helps identify relevant data directly in Microsoft Purview, reducing the amount of data that customers need to prepare and export to their third-party compliance tools. eDiscovery (Premium) builds on the eDiscovery (Standard) solution, helping organizations respond more quickly with a streamlined end-to-end eDiscovery workflow, intelligent search capabilities to decrease manual work, and save on third-party storage costs.
