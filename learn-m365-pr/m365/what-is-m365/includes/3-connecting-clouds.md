## Unlocks creativity 
Microsoft 365 provides powerful capabilities through AI powered tools to unleash your creativity and fuel innovation.

Use SharePoint Online to share resources, news, and apps across the organization with dynamic sites and portals. Build communities, conduct live and on-demand events, share knowledge and best practices, and crowdsource ideas with Yammer. Use OneDrive for Business to share your files securely, view version history, and track changes in apps like Word and PowerPoint to more effectively co-create content.
