Vast amounts of money are involved with major companies handing over huge sums to recover data quickly to minimize impact. It's suspected that the biggest payout was made by an insurance company, who reportedly paid out over $40 million to unlock data and restore its network, although the company hasn't officially confirmed or denied this.

The following facts give an indication of the scale of the problem:  

- Globally, in 2021, known ransomware attacks cost companies more than $20 billion.
- The working from home transformation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic caused a 178% increase in ransomware pay-outs.
- Ransomware attacks in the first half of 2021 exceeded the level for the whole of 2020.
- The top 10 targeted countries in the Western world make up approximately 87% of all attacks.

## Indirect targets

We tend to think that large organizations are at risk, but individuals can be indirect targets as we don't always appreciate that many personal devices are wireless, which means they receive their information directly from the computer systems held at the main organization; this means if the main organization is attacked, then the personal device is also affected.  

The following list highlights areas you might not have considered to be indirect targets:

- Personal devices such as pacemakers, insulin devices, smartphones, smartwatches, body cameras and fitness monitors using cloud technology.
- Cars are increasingly using security software, which uses on-line technology to both secure and monitor any defects on the car.

## Recovering from a ransomware attack

Average payouts for a large company can be as much as $225,000, and for small businesses $6,000, so the financial demands are large.  By paying money to the attackers, you're helping to increase the problem, so the advice is always not to pay.

Of businesses that paid a ransom:

- Only 65% of stolen data is ever returned.
- Approximately 80% were attacked a second time.

Up to 60% of small business failed within six months of an attack due to a combination of:

- Lack of skilled IT resources.
- Being unable to pay out/fight violations of privacy claims.
- The impact of regulatory fines.
- Damage to the reputation of the company.

## Who is most at risk?

As is to be expected the most targeted countries are those with the highest density of population and the highest density of online users, meaning the USA and Europe experience the most attacks. Large and small companies, as well as individuals, are at risk.

The most targeted industries are shown below with the energy, financial and healthcare sectors being the most at risk.
