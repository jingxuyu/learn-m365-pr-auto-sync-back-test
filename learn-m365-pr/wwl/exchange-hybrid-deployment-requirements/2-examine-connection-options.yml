    choices:
    - content: "Cutover migration"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Cutover migration isn't a real coexistence. It provides migration of the user account information and mailbox data. However, no mail routing coexistence is required. Organizations just need to switch their DNS."
    - content: "Hybrid deployment"

    - content: "Staged migration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Staged migration requires directory synchronization to be in place and mail routing between on-premises Exchange and Exchange Online. Try again."
