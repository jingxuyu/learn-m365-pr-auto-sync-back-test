Many organizations need to trust external stores of identity credentials so that more users can access their services. In Microsoft Cloud App Security, you can integrate with a federated security provider so that it can positively identify users and guarantee secure access.

You work for Contoso, a large multi-national organization. Contoso IT management is in the stages of implementing a shift to Microsoft 365. As part of this process, it's important that IT can maintain control of critical corporate data and the apps that access it.

As a security administrator at Contoso, you're involved with implementing Microsoft Cloud App Security to help Contoso meet its security goals. In order to support your users' apps, you must integrate extra identity services with Conditional Access App Control in Cloud App Security.

After completing this module, you'll be able to onboard and configure Conditional Access Control for any app using either PingOne or Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as the identity provider.

## Learning objectives
