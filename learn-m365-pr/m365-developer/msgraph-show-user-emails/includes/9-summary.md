You needed to show a user's emails in your app to let them quickly see who they were communicating with recently. You built your app so that users can sign in to it by using their Microsoft 365 account. After they signed in, you retrieved their latest emails by using Microsoft Graph. By using the Microsoft Authentication Library and Microsoft Graph SDKs, you could quickly connect your app to Microsoft 365 and focus on building your app.
