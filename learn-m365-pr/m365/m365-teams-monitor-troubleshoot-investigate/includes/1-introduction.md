Microsoft Teams interacts with users and real-world external systems. Usage patterns, malicious attacks, and user behavior can all change over time and cause unexpected problems. To spot issues early, before they impact user productivity, administrators need to monitor the Teams system.

Suppose you're the lead administrator for Microsoft Teams at a clothing retailer. You've recently rolled out Microsoft Teams and have been asked to investigate how to track the quality of calls and meetings. You want to understand how to diagnose common problems, and to track Teams performance as demand changes.

In this module, you'll learn how administrators can use features in Teams to monitor its performance.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Demonstrate how to monitor the quality of Teams calls and meetings and eliminate any with poor sound or unreliable connections.
- Explain how to diagnose common problems in Teams by using logs.
- Describe how to maintain capacity in Teams by monitoring user demand and behavior.
