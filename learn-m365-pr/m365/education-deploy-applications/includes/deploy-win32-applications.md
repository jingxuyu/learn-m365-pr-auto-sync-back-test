Intune for Education lets you add 32-bit and 64-bit Win32 applications to your installation repository. You can use the Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) for Intune to add Win32 applications to your account. If the application is packaged as an MSI file, you can use the Intune for Education portal instead.

Here, you'll learn how to install Win32 and MSI applications using Intune and Intune for Education.

## Use MEM for Intune to install a Win32 app

The Intune for Education portal only supports Win32 applications packaged as MSI files. If your application is deployed using an executable file (EXE), you must use MEM. 

A Win32 application must not be greater than 8 GB in size. Additionally, Win32 apps only run on Windows devices; make sure that the devices to which you deploy a Win32 app are running Windows 10 version 1607 or later.

Before you upload a Win32 app, you must prepare it for use by Intune using the Win32 Content Prep Tool, **IntuneWinAppUtil.exe**. Download this tool from the Microsoft GitHub repository at [Intune GitHub repository](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2065730).

Run the tool, and provide the following information:

1. The folder containing the setup files for the Win32 app you want to deploy.

1. The name of the file used to install the app (for example, *setup.exe* or *setup.msi*).

1. The name of a folder that will be used to hold the file generated by the Win32 Content Prep Tool.

1. Optionally, te name of a folder for holding catalog information about the app.

The tool creates a file with the extension *.intunewin*. You upload this file to Intune as follows:

1. Using a browser, connect to the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

1. On the **Home** page, select **Apps** from the menu on the left.
