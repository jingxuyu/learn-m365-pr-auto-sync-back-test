Why are OKRs such a powerful tool for helping companies reach their goals? An ancient parable helps us understand how vision and purpose can change the way we work.

## Parable

In this story, while all three bricklayers were technically doing the same "job," the third bricklayer had three characteristics that set him apart, and are instructive when thinking about OKRs:  

- Focus - he knew exactly what was expected of him.
- Purpose - he was connected to the mission and vision of the project.
- Alignment - he understood how his work contributed up to the end result.

While this parable is hundreds of years old, companies today have a similar goal: drive focus, purpose, and alignment to create more engaged employees and achieve amazing results.

## Company struggles

Companies today face several challenges:

- The pace of business is faster. We live in a collaborative, distributed, cloud-based world where critical business decisions must be made quickly.  
- Industries are being disrupted. New customer behaviors, aggressive competition, and rapidly evolving technology are changing market dynamics.
- Values around work are changing. Modern employees are seeking companies with purpose, meaning, transparency, and who value employee input around key decisions.
- The workforce is global. Collaboration, networking, meetings, and teams now cross geographic, language, time zones and cultural lines.

Fortunately, OKRs help address these issues, and provide a modern business framework for high-growth companies.

## OKR benefits

While Andy Grove is considered the "Father of OKRs," an employee that worked for him named John Doerr helped the framework gain popularity in the tech world and beyond. In his book *Measure What Matters*, Doerr built on the OKR framework and developed the "Five Superpowers," which highlight the benefits OKRs bring to employees and companies. They can generally be summarized as:

- Focus
- Alignment
- Tracking
- Transparency
- Stretch

While these five benefits continue to demonstrate the value of OKRs, *how they're used* within daily business rhythms has grown and developed since Doerr's evangelism to tech firms in the late 1990s. The last 20 years have also introduced a new benefit: Integrated Evolution. Let's take a closer look at each of these benefits and their impact.

- **Focus** helps teams focus on impact rather than output and lets employees focus on the work that matters. As people gain clarity around the "Why" of their work, they experience less burnout and help move the business forward more effectively.
- **Alignment** connects individuals, teams, and departments to the company's broader strategy, which helps work get prioritized correctly and gives employees a sense of how their individual work contributes to the company as a whole.
- **Tracking** enables data-driven decisions and measurable outcomes.
- **Transparency** allows all employees to see goals publicly, which enforces accountability and improves collaboration. This also increases the possibility for employee input and fosters trust between employees and leadership.
- **Stretch** creates the possibility for exponential growth by encouraging people to make goals that are difficult to reach.
- **Integrated Evolution** creates a business rhythm that keeps teams aligned and drives review processes that push for continual improvement.

In short, OKRs allow companies to collaborate and pivot in today's fast-paced environment where industries and technologies change rapidly. OKRs make the purpose within work explicit to employees, so people know that the work they do matters. The intentionality and framework behind OKRs also create the possibility for strategic alignment and increased success, even when teams are disparate or remote.
