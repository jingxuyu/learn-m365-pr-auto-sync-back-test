Microsoft Search helps protect your users and your school's content with enhanced privacy and security measures:

- School user info and content—including profiles, assignments, and files—are never visible to public web users or other organizations, including Microsoft.
- A district or school can determine if students can see each other’s profiles. These settings are covered in Unit 5.
- Students and teachers can only access sites and files they created or have been shared with them.
- SafeSearch is set to strict by default for all web results, including images and videos. This setting is applied to everyone in your school by default.
