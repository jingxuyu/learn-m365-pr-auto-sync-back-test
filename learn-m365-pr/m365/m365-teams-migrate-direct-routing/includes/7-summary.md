Direct Routing allows you to connect an existing phone infrastructure to the Microsoft Teams service. Using a certified Session Border Controller (SBC) you route calls from your public switched telephone network (PSTN) to Microsoft's Phone System.

By developing a migration plan, you are able to properly place the SBC and prepare for the cut over. You have been able to move your users from Skype for Business Server to Teams Direct routing. In addition, you have learned how to stage the migration  and afterwards, perform some clean-up operations.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe how to prepare an on-premises Skype for Business Server telephony system for migration to Teams Direct Routing.
- Explain how to migrate a telephony system to Teams Direct Routing.
- Describe how Teams connects calls by using Dynamic Routing during the migration.
- Demonstrate how administrators complete a migration to Teams Direct Routing.
