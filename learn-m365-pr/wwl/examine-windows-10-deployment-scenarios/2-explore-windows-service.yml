  - content: "Which servicing channel is designed only for specialized devices that don’t need feature updates as frequently as other devices in an organization?"
    choices:
    - content: "General Availability Channel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This channel isn't designed for specialized devices that don’t need feature updates as frequently as other devices in an organization."
    - content: "Long-term Servicing Channel"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Long-term Servicing Channel (LTSC) is designed only for specialized devices, which typically don't run Office. Specialized systems—such as devices that control medical equipment, point-of-sale systems, and ATMs—often require a longer servicing option because of their purpose. These devices typically perform a single important task. As such, they don’t need feature updates as frequently as other devices in the organization."
