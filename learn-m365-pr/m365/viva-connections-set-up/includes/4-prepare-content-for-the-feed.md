The Feed aggregates SharePoint news posts, video news links, and conversation in Yammer into one central place. In the mobile app, the Feed displays as its own tab. On desktop, the Feed can be included by adding the Feed web part to the home site, which will be covered in an upcoming unit. Technically, *you don't need to do anything* for content to populate in the Feed if your organization already uses [SharePoint news posts](/sharepoint/organization-news-site) and [Yammer.](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=577a5b674b3c22b601cec0336b5b3382218bf922f2d243c50dbe788fd5d05742JmltdHM9MTY1NDE5MTI5OCZpZ3VpZD1jMGNjODg2MC1mMWEzLTRkM2ItOWY5Mi0xMDNkY2M4YWE4OTAmaW5zaWQ9NTE3NQ&ptn=3&fclid=52a4d99a-e29a-11ec-ac46-276dea4d8649&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9taWNyb3NvZnQtMzY1L2Jsb2cvMjAxMi8wMi8wOS9nZXR0aW5nLXN0YXJ0ZWQtd2l0aC15YW1tZXItdGhlLWJhc2ljcy1hbmQtYmV5b25kLw&ntb=1)

**Feed content comes from three main sources:**

- Organizational news posts published in SharePoint
- Posts in Yammer communities
- Videos posted as videos news links from organization news sites in SharePoint

You don't need to do anything for content to populate the Feed, but you can influence the hierarchy of content in the Feed. To ensure the most important news is prioritized in the Feed:

- **Promote important communications** - Use [News boost](https://support.microsoft.com/office/boost-news-from-organization-news-sites-46ad8dc5-8f3b-4d81-853d-8bbbdd0f9c83) to raise the visibility of the most important news posts.
- **Highlight community discussions** - [Feature posts in public Yammer communities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/engage-your-entire-organization-with-new-all-company-features/ba-p/1441124) that you’d like seen by the entire organization.
- **Publish from official news sources** - Post news from [organizational news sites in SharePoint](/sharepoint/organization-news-site) to impact content ranking.
- **Use video news links in SharePoint.** Rather than sharing a written news story, you may want to use a [Video news link](/sharepoint/video-news-links) in SharePoint to share an update, rebroadcast an all-hands meeting, or provide reusable training materials.
