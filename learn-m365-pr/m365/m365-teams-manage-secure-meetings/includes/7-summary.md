In your recruitment software company, Microsoft Teams meetings are widely used and considered essential, but you were concerned the rich meetings functionality might include security vulnerabilities when used poorly. By using Teams meetings policies, you can disable features, such as desktop sharing, which could be used to circumvent restrictions on access to information. You also investigated and secured the location of Teams recordings.

Without Teams meeting policies, you have little control over user actions in meetings. Policies are easy to create and allow you to control many meetings without configuring each one individually.

Now you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Explore how to address threats to Teams meetings.
- Demonstrate how to configure Teams meeting settings.
- Explain how to manage meetings by using meeting policies in Microsoft Teams.
- Describe how to control cloud recordings by using Teams policies.
