Microsoft 365 Live events brings live video streaming to a new level. Live events help to drive connection throughout the entire life cycle of engagement with attendees before, during, and after live events.

You can create a live event wherever your audience, team, or community is located, using Microsoft Stream, Microsoft Teams, or Yammer. Attendees receive notifications and can participate in real time. Live events can include high-definition (HD) video and interactive discussion. They can also be viewed using web, mobile, or desktop apps. For employees who are in different time zones or unable to attend live, the conversation keeps going so they still feel connected to leaders and peers. This feature helps to overcome geographical or organizational boundaries.

After an event, it’s easy to make the recording available on an event page. Doing so enables people to watch the event on their own schedule and catch up quickly with powerful AI features that unlock the content of the event recording. The recording is automatically transcribed and detects changes in speakers, making it simple to search for content later.

* **Live events in Teams** - Live events in Teams are a great way to structure and deliver large broadcast-style **internal** and **external** events to reach employees, customers, and business partners. When they host Live events in Teams, presenters can connect through their camera and share screens in just a few selections. Attendees can participate from any browser or device as easily as attending a Teams meeting. Moderated Q&A and live captions are also available to enhance the attendee experience. For more formal events, event organizers can opt for professional broadcasts that use other video production tools.

* **Live events in Yammer** - Use Live events in Yammer when you want to engage a broad **internal community** or reach employees company-wide on an issue with ongoing engagement. CEO town halls and Ask Me Anything (AMA) events work well in Yammer. Webcams and screen-sharing can be used, or for more studio-quality broadcasts, other production tools are available.

* **Live events in Stream** - Host Live events in Stream when you’re delivering **internal** live or on-demand video for learning, training, or other specialized issues. Live broadcasts can be viewed in Stream or embedded on custom intranet pages or other hosting spots, and when the event ends employees can find them there later. These events also use other production tools to enable studio-quality broadcasts.
