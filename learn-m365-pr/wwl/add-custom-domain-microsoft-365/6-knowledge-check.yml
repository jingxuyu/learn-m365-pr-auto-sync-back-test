    - content: "TXT"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This record is a requirement for Sender Policy Framework (SPF) anti-spam protection and for organizations that use federation. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, you manage the company's Microsoft 365 tenant. You have a custom domain that you want to add to Microsoft 365. However, because the IT team had several key members quit over the past year, you're not sure if one of those former employees registered the domain using their personal information. How can you find out who registered the domain?"
    choices:
    - content: "Contact any of the top 10 domain name registrars"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action won't help you find out who registered the domain. Try again."
    - content: "Contact any of the top 10 DNS hosting providers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action won't help you find out who registered the domain. Try again."
    - content: "Check the WHOIS record for that domain by using an Internet WHOIS register"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Check the WHOIS record for that domain by using an Internet WHOIS register, such as who.is."
  - content: "Fabrikam has a Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription. The company recently purchased a new subsidiary that will be named Fabrikam Residences. As Fabrikam's Enterprise Administrator, you want to add a custom domain titled fabrikamresidences.com for the new subsidiary. You also want to register a subdomain titled content.fabrikamresidences.com that will be under the fabrikamresidences.com root domain. What should you do to add these two domains to your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription?"
    choices:
    - content: "Register the subdomain first and then register the root domain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action won't add these two domains to your Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription. Try again."
    - content: "Register the root domain first and then register the subdomain"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Root domains must be added before subdomains. So fabrikamresidences.com must be registered before you add content.fabrikamresidences.com."
    - content: "Microsoft 365 Business Premium doesn't support subdomains. Fabrikam must upgrade to Microsoft 365 Enterprise before it can register a subdomain under a root domain"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both Microsoft 365 Business Premium and Enterprise plans enable you to add subdomains under a root domain. Try again."
