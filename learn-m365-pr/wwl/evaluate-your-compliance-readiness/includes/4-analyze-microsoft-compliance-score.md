Microsoft Compliance Score helps to simplify the way you manage compliance and reduce compliance risks through a user-friendly experience.

Microsoft Compliance Score is a feature in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center. Its purpose is to help an organization understand its compliance posture. It calculates a risk-based score measuring an organization's progress in completing actions that help reduce risks around data protection and regulatory standards.

An organization can use the Compliance Score as a tool to track all its risk assessments. Compliance Score provides workflow capabilities to help organizations efficiently complete their risk assessments through a common tool.

> [!NOTE]
> If you currently use Compliance Manager, you'll notice the Compliance Score is now a standalone feature with a simpler, more user-friendly design to help you manage compliance. Compliance Score shares the same back end with Compliance Manager, so any data you may already have in Compliance Manager will appear in Compliance Score. It's recommended that you begin all of your compliance management activities in the Compliance Score portal.

The main Compliance Score page is your custom dashboard. It shows the organization's current score, helps you see what needs attention, and guides you to actions to improve your score.

### Understanding your score

Your compliance score is featured prominently at the top of the Compliance Score page. It shows a percentage based on points achievable for completing improvement actions that address key data protection standards and regulations. Points from [Microsoft actions](/microsoft-365/compliance/compliance-manager-assessments), which are managed my Microsoft, also count toward your compliance score.

When you come to Compliance Manager for the first time, your initial score is based on the [Microsoft 365 data protection baseline](/microsoft-365/compliance/compliance-manager-assessments). This baseline assessment, which is available to all organizations, is a set of controls that includes common industry regulations and standards. Compliance Manager scans your existing Microsoft 365 solutions and gives you an initial assessment based on your current privacy and security settings. As you add assessments that are relevant to your organization, your score becomes more meaningful for you.

The Compliance Score dashboard displays a score that measures an organization's progress in completing improvement actions within controls. The organization accrues points when it completes actions. An organization's score is calculated based on the completion of Microsoft-managed actions and customer-managed actions. Each action has a different impact on the score, depending on the potential risks involved. This design enables the Compliance Score to rank which action to focus on to improve a company's overall compliance posture.

The Compliance Score values that are displayed for the control are applied in their entirety to the total score on a pass/fail basis. Either the control is implemented and passes the next assessment test, or it doesn't. Assigned points are added to Compliance Score when the control has:

 -  **Implementation Status** equals **Implemented** or **Alternative Implementation** and,
 -  **Test Result** equals **Passed**.

The sum of points earned by taking improvement actions is the control score. The sum of a company's control scores is its assessment score. The sum of the company's assessment scores is its overall compliance score.
