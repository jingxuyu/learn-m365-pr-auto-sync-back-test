  title: Exercise - Reduce traffic with batched requests
  description: In this exercise, you'll use the Graph Explorer to create and issue a single request that contains multiple child requests. This batching of requests enables developers to submit multiple requests in a single round-trip request to Microsoft Graph, creating more optimized queries.

quiz:
  title: Reduce HTTP round trips with batch requests
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following statements is true about the batch request support in Microsoft Graph?"
    choices:
    - content: "Batching reduces the number of round trips an application makes to Microsoft Graph by submitting multiple requests in one HTTP round trip."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Batching enables an application that has multiple Microsoft Graph requests to include them in one HTTP round trip, redicing the time it takes for each request/response pair."
    - content: "Batching enables applications to implement transactions so if one request fails, all others will fail and be rolled back."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Graph doesn't support transactions among multiple requests. Each request is executed independently whatever if its submitted within a batch or not."
    - content: "Microsoft Graph prioritizes requests submitted as a batch to reward applications that submit fewer HTTP requests."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Microsoft Graph doesn't treat a batch request any differently than an individual request."
  - content: "How can multiple requests be executed in order within a batch request?"
    choices:
    - content: "The order requests are specified in the batch object is the order Microsoft Graph will execute them."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The order the requests are listed in the batch doesn't define the order the Microsoft Graph will execute them."
    - content: "Requests can be nested in the batch object submitted to Microsoft Graph to define a dependency hierarchy."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The batch request object is a flat collection of requests, not a hierarchy of requests."
    - content: "Each request must include an ID property. Other requests use a DependsOn array to define the requests it depends on."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! Continue to the next unit in the module."
