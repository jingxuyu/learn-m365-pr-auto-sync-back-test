Everyone in your organization plays an important role in managing access to information. When adequate access controls aren't consistently applied, it can result in something we refer to as 'oversharing.' Managing access to files and sites will help prevent oversharing in search results, recommended feeds, and more.

In this module, we'll go over the solutions and controls available to manage access to information on SharePoint, OneDrive, and Delve. We’ll also look at how search entry points, like embedded search boxes and Microsoft Edge work shortcuts, can help users find work or school results faster. Lastly, we’ll discuss feedback and using it to monitor and evaluate the search experience.

**Scenario:** Suppose the leadership team at a pharmaceuticals company is concerned about sites with sensitive information appearing in search results. To address this, a Search admin has connected with other IT team members to ensure access controls are in place. The communications team is also sharing information about how users can help manage access to files broadly within the company.

## Learning objectives
