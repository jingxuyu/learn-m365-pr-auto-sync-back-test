Microsoft weaves built-in experiences, AI and automation, and an integrated eco-system into its security and compliance solution areas.


##Security
Microsoft's security solutions include the following technology areas:

* Identity and access management
* Threat protection
* Cloud security 

### Identity and access management
Most breaches begin with compromised passwords—it’s the single weakest link in most security strategies. That’s why we start with identity and access management to protect your resources. Identity is at the center of security. You must protect identity to protect your resources. It’s the front door—both in terms of security and productivity.  

With the growing importance of mobility and the transition to the cloud, we’ve built identity solutions that help keep your employees and external users productive and secure. At the same time, we help your organization stay compliant and protected against threats. Key elements of Microsoft’s Identity and access management include the following:
* Single sign-on - Get better control and visibility through a single sign-in experience across apps and devices with Azure Active Directory. All apps, whether on-premises, cloud, or third-party SaaS apps can be managed across any device. You gain control and visibility, and simplify the experience for users.
* Strong Authentication - We support a broad range of authentication options to fit the needs of your business and your users, including Microsoft Authenticator mobile app and Windows Hello.
* Conditional Access - Microsoft Conditional Access is an intelligent policy engine that helps make sure that only the right people with the right resources on secure devices can access your data.
* Identity protection - Identity protection keeps you informed of suspicious user and sign-in behavior in your environment. It works 24/7 and automatically responds to proactively prevent compromised identities from being abused. 
* Identity governance - Protect, monitor, and audit access to critical assets throughout the user lifecycle. And ensure the right access for the right users at the right time.

### Threat protection
Organizations have concerns about the high volume of data they store, as well as the increasing sophistication and impact of attacks. Integrated and automated threat protection is designed to help meet the demand for advanced security that works in the real world.

Microsoft Threat Protection’s suite of best-in-class products includes specific security solutions to help protect each of the major perimeters: identity, endpoint, apps and data. Data includes content associated with email and collaboration tools including Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business and Office clients.  Secure any endpoint, anywhere, via a unified platform for preventive protection, post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response. Microsoft Threat Protection works on the desktop, mobile devices, and servers, regardless of OS, which gives organizations and users the flexibility to choose the devices they want to use.

### Cloud security
As enterprises move more of their workloads to the cloud, it has never been more important to protect cross-cloud resources. From Azure to AWS, from Slack to Salesforce, we’ve built comprehensive cloud security to protect every layer of your resources, regardless of which cloud or cloud apps you use.  

With Microsoft Cloud App Security, you can gain rich visibility into your shadow IT, and identify and remediate cloud native attacks. You can control how your data travels across all of your cloud apps, whether they’re from Microsoft or third-party applications.  Microsoft Cloud App Security supports native integrations across Microsoft’s broader solution portfolio to ensure single-click deployments.

## Compliance

Microsoft's compliance solutions include the following technology areas:

* Information protection & governance
* Insider risk management
* Discover and respond
* Compliance management

### Information protection & governance
The exponential growth of data, blurring of traditional organizational boundaries, and acceleration of collaboration among the workforce have made protecting and governing important data more challenging than over. Data is created, stored and shared across many locations – devices, apps, cloud services and on-premises. The evolving compliance landscape only adds to the complexity. 

We give customers the flexibility to implement the necessary controls to meet both internal and external security and compliance requirements. Knowing your data, protecting your data, and governing your data are all outcomes that are powered and enriched by an intelligent platform. This includes:

* A common approach to data classification, no matter where the data resides.
* A unified policy configuration and management experience for IT.
* An analytics dashboard to monitor and remediate issues.
* A set of APIs that enables the ecosystem to extend our information protection and governance capabilities to their own apps and services.

### Insider risk management
Orangiziations need to be able to identify, analyze, and remediate internal risks before they cause harm.  Insider risk management policies give you visibility into, and control over:
* Internal data access.
* Identify and manage corporate policy violations such as harassment, code-of-conduct, and fraud.
* Data leakages by insiders, including IP theft, confidential data, etc.

### Discover and respond 
Data explosion creates challenges of finding the data you need when you need it for a variety of scenarios.  Whether it is litigation, internal investigation, responding to a regulatory request or policy obligation – you need to be able to find relevant content, refine that content and prepare that content to be handed off to the requesting body in an efficient and effective way.  Microsoft’s discover and respond solution provides intelligent tools to help address the needs of data discovery and audit, to address these compliance challenges.

### Compliance management
Compliance management enables companies to simplify compliance and reduce risk, collaborate better across teams, and manage your digital and compliance risk with recommended actions to implement effective controls.  Compliance management from Microsoft provides:
* Continuous assessments - Detect and monitor control effectiveness automatically with a risk-based score.
* Recommended actions - Reduce compliance risks with actionable guidance.
* Built-in Control Mapping - Scale your compliance efforts with built-in mapping across regulations and standards.

Throughout the modules in this learning path, we cover each of these security and compliance solution areas, and associated products, in more detail.
