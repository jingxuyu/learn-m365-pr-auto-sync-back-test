Connecting a Windows client to a network has become a typically automatic process. When Windows is installed, the default network drivers and settings are typically enough to get connected and locate a server or router that governs the network environment and provides the necessary information to the client connect to the local network. In a typical home or public network, it’s often a matter of just plugging in an ethernet cable, or in the case of wireless connections, entering the SSID (service set identifier) and a password, if applicable, to access common resources such as the Internet.

Connecting a device to an organization’s network can be more complex, and the default settings may not be sufficient for connecting to a network or accessing certain resources. Regardless of the network settings or complexity, it’s not an uncommon occurrence for a device to occasionally have difficulty connecting to a network. This is especially true of mobile devices.

So it is important that you understand the fundamentals of both IPv4 and IPv6, and know how to configure them in Windows within the context of your organization’s network infrastructure.
