Office 365 ATP provides the following benefits:

- **Industry-leading Protection.** Office 365 ATP leverages 6.5 trillion signals daily from email alone to quickly and accurately detect threats and protect users against sophisticated attacks such as phishing and zero-day malware. Office 365 ATP blocked 5 billion phish emails and analyzed 300k phish campaigns in 2018 protecting 4 million unique users from advanced threats. 
- **Actionable Insights**. Actionable insights are presented to security administrators by correlating signals from a broad range of data to help identify, prioritize, and provide recommendations on how to address potential problems. The recommendations include remediation actions empowering administrators to proactively secure their organization.
- **Automated response**. Investigation and remediation in post-breach scenarios can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Most organizations lack the expertise and resources needed for rapid investigation and effective remediation. Office 365 ATP provides advanced automated response options that security operators can leverage saving a significant amount of time, money, and resources. 
- **Training & awareness**. Social engineering attacks such as phishing often look legitimate and are hard to spot for busy users. It's critical to train end users to make the right decisions in the event of an attack. In-product notifications help users understand the risks of performing an action such as clicking on a suspicious link. Features such as attack simulator help administrators launch realistic threat simulations to train users to be more aware and vigilant. User reporting capabilities empower users to notify Microsoft of suspicious content. 

The following are the primary ways you can use ATP for message protection:

- In an Office 365 ATP filtering-only scenario, ATP provides cloud-based email protection for your on-premises Exchange Server environment or any other on-premises SMTP email solution.
- Office 365 ATP can be enabled to protect Exchange Online cloud-hosted mailboxes. 
- In a hybrid deployment, ATP can be configured to protect your messaging environment and control mail routing when you have a mix of on-premises and cloud mailboxes with Exchange Online Protection for inbound email filtering.
