Microsoft Office clients enable developers to create add-ins that extend Microsoft Outlook with custom functionality. Through a JavaScript API, developers can access and edit the contents in an email or calendar event in Outlook from an app running in the client.

In this module, you learned how to build an Outlook add-in that rendered buttons in the compose message window, implemented a button that invoked a function, and implemented a task pane that inserted content into the body of a message.
