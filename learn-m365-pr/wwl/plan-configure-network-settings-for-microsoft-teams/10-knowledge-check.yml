  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Team administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is investigating why audio quality has been acceptable in Teams meetings, but video quality has been poor. What typically causes this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Proxy servers are bypassed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It is recommended that proxy servers should be bypassed."
    - content: "Band steering is implemented"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Band steering is a technique implemented by WiFi vendors to influence dual-band clients to use the 5-GHz range."
    - content: "Bandwidth is insufficient"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When bandwidth is insufficient, Teams prioritizes audio quality over video quality."
  - content: "As the Team administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to optimize the performance of the company's Microsoft 365 cloud-based services. Which of the following items will help Holly achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "Open TCP ports 80 and 443"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When bandwidth is insufficient, Teams prioritizes audio quality over video quality."
    - content: "Use the Office 365 IP Address and URL Web Service to get change notification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item is a recommended task to improve change management, but doesn't optimize the performance of the company's Microsoft 365 cloud-based services."
    - content: "Open UDP ports 80 through 443"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Fabrikam should open UDP ports 3478 through 3481."
  - content: "As the Team administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to prepare data files for the Call Quality Dashboard. The format of the data files must meet which of the following criteria to pass the validation check before upload?"
    choices:
    - content: "The file must be either a .tsv file (columns are separated by a TAB) or a .csv file (columns are separated by a comma)"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The file must be either a .tsv file or a .csv file to pass the validation check before upload."
    - content: "The data file must include a table header row"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The data file can't include a table header row."
    - content: "The data file must be an Endpoint data file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The data file can either be a Building data file or an Endpoint data file."
  - content: "As the Teams administrator for Northwind Traders, Allan DeYoung wants to determine and organize network requirements for connecting Microsoft Teams users across the entire organization. Allan is especially excited about creating representations of Northwind Traders using sites and Microsoft recommended personas. Which of the following tools will enable Allan to meet these goals?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft 365 connectivity test"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Microsoft 365 connectivity test network assessment tool runs basic connectivity tests against your Microsoft 365 tenant and makes specific network design recommendations for optimal Microsoft 365 performance."
    - content: "Network Planner"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Network Planner is designed to assist the admin to determine and organize network requirements for connecting Microsoft Teams users across the whole organization. After providing network details and Teams usage, the Network Planner calculates the network requirements for deploying Teams and cloud voice across the organizationâ€™s physical locations. With Network Planner, Allan can create representations of Northwind Traders using sites and Microsoft recommended personas (office workers, remote workers, and Teams room system devices)."
    - content: "Call Quality Dashboard"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) provides a network-wide view of call quality across an organization."
  - content: "Contoso is currently experiencing quality issues in video and voice. For example, media packets are arriving at different rates, packets are being dropped, and media packets are taking a long time to reach their destinations. Which of the following tools will enable Contoso to address these issues by more effectively managing their resources rather than having to add bandwidth?"
    choices:
    - content: "Quality of Service"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Quality of Service (QoS) in Microsoft Teams allows real-time network traffic that's sensitive to network delays (for example, voice or video streams) to \"cut in line\" in front of traffic that's less sensitive (like downloading a new app, where an extra second to download isn't a large deal). QoS provides a way to more effectively manage the resources you have instead of adding bandwidth. Without some form of QoS, an organization may see the following quality issues in voice and video - jitter, packet loss, and delayed round-trip time."
    - content: "Call Analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Call analytics shows call and meeting quality for individual users in Teams."
    - content: "An Intrusion Detection or Prevention System"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An Intrusion Detection or Prevention System (IDS/IPS) provides an extra layer of security for outbound connections."
  - content: "As the network engineer for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to build a network-wide view of call quality across the organization. Holly wants to include different building locations or endpoint-specific views such as wired or Wi-Fi connected devices. This reporting will enable Holly to assess the data to determine whether a problem is isolated to a single user or affects a larger segment of users. Which of the following tools will provide Holly with this reporting functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call analytics"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Call analytics shows call and meeting quality for individual users in Teams."
    - content: "Call Quality Dashboard"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) provides a network-wide view of call quality across an organization. Location-enhanced CQD reports help the network engineer determine if the problem is a site-related issue. For example, you can include different building locations or endpoint-specific views such as wired or Wi-Fi connected devices. The data can be assessed to determine if the problem is isolated to a single user or affects a larger segment of users."
    - content: "Quality of Service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Quality of Service (QoS) in Microsoft Teams allows real-time network traffic that's sensitive to network delays (for example, voice or video streams) to \"cut in line\" in front of traffic that's less sensitive."
