Vast amounts of money are involved, with major companies handing over huge sums to recover data quickly and minimize impact. It’s suspected that the biggest payout was made by one insurance company, who reportedly paid more than $40 million to unlock data and restore its network. The company hasn't officially confirmed or denied this. 

Here’s an indication of the scale of the problem:  

- Globally, known ransomware attacks in 2021 cost companies more than $20 billion.
- The working-from-home transformation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 178 percent increase in ransomware pay-outs.
- Ransomware attacks in the first half of 2021 exceeded the level for the whole of 2020.
- The top 10 targeted countries in the western world make up approximately 87 percent of all attacks.

## Indirect targets

We tend to think that only large organizations are at risk, but individuals can be indirect targets too. We don't always appreciate that many personal devices have wireless capabilities, which means they receive information directly from the computer systems held at the main organization. If this organization is attacked, then the personal device is also affected.  

The following list highlights areas you might not have considered to be indirect targets:

- Personal items such as heart pacemakers, insulin devices, smartphones, smartwatches, body cameras and fitness monitors that use cloud technology.
- Cars are increasingly using security software with online technology to secure and monitor any defects.

## Recovering from a ransomware attack

Average payouts can range from $6,000 for a small business to as much as $225,000 for a large company, so the financial demands are high. By giving money to the attackers, you’re helping to increase the problem, so the advice is always not to pay.

Of businesses that paid a ransom:

- Only 65 percent of stolen data has ever been returned.
- Approximately 80 percent were attacked a second time.

Up to 60 percent of small businesses failed within six months of an attack, due to a combination of:

- Lack of skilled IT resources.
- Being unable to pay out/fight violations of privacy claims.
- The impact of regulatory fines.
- Damage to the reputation of the company.

## Who is most at risk?

As would be expected, the most targeted countries are those with the highest density of population and online users, meaning the USA and Europe experience the most attacks. Large and small companies, as well as individuals, are at risk.

The most targeted industries are shown below with the energy, financial and healthcare sectors being the most at risk.
