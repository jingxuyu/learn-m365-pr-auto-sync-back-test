Information barriers (IB) policies can play an integral part in an organization. However, they can cause issues if they're improperly configured. For example, an improperly configured policy can prevent collaboration when collaboration should be allowed. As a result, it's critical that administrators understand the capabilities of information barrier policies.

> [!NOTE]
> Information barrier policies can only be implemented using PowerShell at this time.

### Prerequisites<br>

The following requirements must be met before configuring an IB policy:

 -  **Licenses.** The minimum license needed is Office 365 E5/A5, although other licenses can be used. For a complete license list, see [required licenses and permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers?azure-portal=true).
 -  **Directory data.** Organizations must ensure their structure is reflected in their directory data. For example, organizations should ensure that user account attributes, such as group membership, department name, and so on, are populated correctly in Azure Active Directory (or Exchange Online). For more information, see the following resources:
    
     -  [Attributes for information barrier policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers-attributes?azure-portal=true).
     -  [Add or update a user's profile information using Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal?azure-portal=true).
     -  [Configure user account properties with Office 365 PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/configure-user-account-properties-with-microsoft-365-powershell?azure-portal=true).
 -  **Scoped directory search.** Before an organization defines its first information barrier policy, it must [enable scoped directory search in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-scoped-directory-search?azure-portal=true). Wait at least 24 hours after enabling scoped directory search before you set up or define information barrier policies.
 -  **Exchange Online license.** Information barrier policies work only if the target users have been assigned an Exchange Online license.
 -  **Audit logging.** To look up the status of a policy application, audit logging must be turned on. It's recommended that you enable auditing before you begin to define segments or policies. For more information, see [Turn the audit log search on or off](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off?azure-portal=true).
 -  **No address book policies.** Before you define and apply information barrier policies, make sure no Exchange address book policies are in place. Information barriers are based on address book policies, but the two kinds of policies aren't compatible. If you do have such policies, make sure to [remove your address book policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/address-books/address-book-policies/remove-an-address-book-policy?azure-portal=true) first. Once information barrier policies are enabled and you have hierarchical address book enabled, all users **who aren't included** in an information barrier segment will see the [hierarchical address book](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/address-books/hierarchical-address-books/hierarchical-address-books?azure-portal=true) in Exchange Online.
 -  **Azure PowerShell module.** Currently, information barrier policies are defined and managed in the Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center using PowerShell cmdlets. Organizations must install the Azure PowerShell module. For more information, see:
    
     -  [Connect to Security &amp; Compliance Center PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell?azure-portal=true).
     -  [Install the Azure PowerShell module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?azure-portal=true).

### Planning information barrier policies<br>

Organizations must consider the following questions before configuring information barrier policies:

 -  What are the legal or industry regulations regarding the groups inside your organization?
 -  Are there any groups who should be prevented from communicating with another group?
 -  Are there any groups that should be allowed to communicate only with one or two other groups?

These questions can help an organization get a picture on what IB policies they must implement inside their organization. Once they begin creating policies, they can separate the policies into two types:

 -  **Block policies.** These policies prevent one group from communicating with another group.
 -  **Allow policies.** These policies allow a group to communicate with only certain groups.

When determining how to segment the groups, create a list of policies for each of these two types. Then create a list of segments for your organization. Users who will be included in information barrier policies should belong to a segment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Plan your segments carefully because a user can only be in one segment. Also, each segment can have only one information barrier policy applied.

### Initial setup

Organizations must carefully plan information barriers in Microsoft Teams. When your IB policies are in place, they can remove non-IB compliance users from Groups (for example, Teams channels, which are based on groups). This design helps ensure your organization remains compliant with policies and regulations.

Organizations should complete the following steps to enable information barrier policies in Microsoft Teams:

1.  Install the Azure PowerShell module.
2.  Run the following PowerShell command. This command tries to establish a handshake to your Microsoft 365 tenant through the Azure portal. It then identifies the information barrier application and starts the authorization request to use information barriers inside the organization.
    
    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount -Tenant "&lt;yourtenantdomain.com&gt;" 
    
    //for example: Connect-AzAccount -Tenant "Contoso.onmicrosoft.com"
    
    $appId="&lt;app id&gt;"
    
    $sp=Get-AzADServicePrincipal -ServicePrincipalName $appId
    
    if ($sp -eq $null) {New-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $appId}
    
    Start-Process â€œhttps://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=$appId"
    ```
3.  When prompted, sign in using your work or school account for Microsoft 365.
4.  In the **permissions requested** dialog box, review the information and then choose **to accept**.
