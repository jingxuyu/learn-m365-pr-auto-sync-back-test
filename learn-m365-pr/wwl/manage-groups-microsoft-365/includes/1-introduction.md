After you create your users for the Microsoft 365 tenant, you can optionally create groups for collaboration between users, both inside and outside your company. In Exchange Online, groups enable organizations to distribute email to multiple users. In SharePoint Online, groups are used to support cross-team collaboration. You can add people from outside your organization to a group as long as this permission has been enabled by the administrator.
