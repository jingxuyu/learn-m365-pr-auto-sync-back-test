To edit an existing topic, you need:
- A Viva Topics license 
- Permissions to **Who can create or edit topics**. Knowledge admins can give users this permission in the Viva Topics topic permissions settings.

You can edit a topic by opening the topic page from a topic highlight, and then selecting **Edit** on the top right of the topic page. The topic page can also be opened from the Topic Center home page, where you can find all the topics that you have a connection to.

To edit a topic page:

1. Select **Edit** on the topic page. This lets you make changes as needed to the topic page. 
2. In the **Alternate Names** section, type any other names that the topic might be referred to. 
3. In the **Description** section, type a couple of sentences that describes the topic. Or if a description already exists, update it if needed. 
4. In the **Pinned people** section, you can "pin" a person to show them as having a connection the topic (for example, an owner of a connected resource). Begin by typing their name or email address in **Add a new user**, and then selecting the user you want to add from the search results. You can also "unpin" them by selecting **Remove from list** on the user card. 

   The **Suggested people** section shows users that AI thinks might be connected to the topic from their connection to resources about the topic. You can change their status from **Suggested** to **Pinned** by selecting the pin icon on the user card. 
5. In the **Pinned files and pages** section, you can add or "pin" a file or SharePoint site page that is associated to the topic. 
6. The **Suggested files and pages** section shows files and pages that AI suggests being associated to the topic. You can change a suggested file or page to a pinned file or page by selecting the pinned icon. 
7. The **Related sites** section shows sites that have information about the topic. You can add a related site by selecting **Add** and then either searching for the site or selecting it from your list of **Frequent or Recent sites**. You can then give a description of how the topics are related and select Update. The related topic you added will display as a connected topic. 

   To remove a related topic, select the topic you want to remove, then select **Remove topic > Remove**. 
8. You can also add static items to the page â€” such as text, images, or links - by selecting the canvas icon, which you can find below the short description. This opens the SharePoint toolbox from which you can choose the item you want to add to the page. 
9. Select **Publish** or **Republish** to save your changes. (**Republish** will be your available option if the topic has been published previously.)
