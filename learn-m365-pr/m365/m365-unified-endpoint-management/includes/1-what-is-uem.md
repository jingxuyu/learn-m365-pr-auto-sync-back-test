 Today's technology is changing the way we all work. Digital transformations enable the flexibility to work from anywhere, on any device. That flexibility doesn't mean, however, that you're no longer responsible for the security of your organization's data - no matter where it lives. Modern workplaces demand a new approach to managing and securing devices, alongside seamless interactions between the productivity tools you rely on.

**Unified endpoint management** describes a platform that includes device and app management. Microsoft Intune and System Center Configuration Manager (Configuration Manager), part of Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) in your Microsoft 365 subscription, help simplify modern workplace management. Use them to create the most productive Microsoft 365 environment for your users to work on devices and apps they choose, all while protecting your org's data.
