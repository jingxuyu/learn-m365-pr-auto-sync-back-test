  questions:
  - content: "What is the recommended way to retrieve data from Microsoft Graph?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the `AadHttpClient` object from the SharePoint Framework API to call the Microsoft Graph endpoint. This object is returned by calling the `this.context.aadHttpClientFactory.getClient('https://...')` method and is configured with the necessary access token included in every HTTP request."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you can use the `AadHttpClient` and `aadHttpClientFactory` objects in the SharePoint Framework API, the `msGraphClientFactory` object simplifies obtaining a configured instance of the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK."
    - content: "Obtain an access token with the `this.context.aadHttpClientFactory.getToken()` method and configure a new instance of the `MSGraphClient` object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While you can obtain an access token and configure an instance of the `MSGraphClient` object, the `msGraphClientFactory` object simplifies obtaining a configured instance of the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK."
    - content: "Use the `msGraphClientFactory` to obtain a reference to the `MSGraphClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "How do you get the current user's details using the `MSGraphClient` object?"
    choices:
    - content: "Call the `MSGraphClient.api('https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me') method that will return the current user's details."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `api()` method should only include the part of the URL after the `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/`, not the entire endpoint."
    - content: "Call the `MSGraphClient.api('currentUser') method that will return the current user's details."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The correct endpoint for the current user is the `me` endpoint, not the `currentUser` endpoint."
    - content: "Call the `MSGraphClient.api('me') method that will return the current user's details."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
