This module examined the key features that organizations must consider when planning their Microsoft 365 tenant. A Microsoft 365 tenant is a dedicated instance of the Microsoft 365 service that an organization receives and owns when it creates a relationship with Microsoft. Each Microsoft 365 tenant is unique and separate from other Microsoft 365 tenants. Your Microsoft 365 tenant is the set of services assigned to your organization. Typically, this tenant is associated with one or more of an organization's public DNS domain names. It acts as a central and isolated container for different subscriptions and the licenses within them that you assign to user accounts.

This module reviewed the tasks that organizations must complete after ensuring their network is optimized for access to Microsoft 365 for both on-premises and remote workers. These tasks include planning for and then configuring your Microsoft 365 tenant for DNS domain names, common services, and for that identity infrastructure that supports secure user sign-in. To get your tenant ready for user, groups, licenses, and cloud apps, it's critical to carefully plan and execute your tenant configuration.

In this module, you examined the key areas that organizations must plan for in order to create their Microsoft 365 tenant. These areas included subscription options, tenant components, and the overall migration process.
