  description:  eDiscovery offers built-in tools such as Content Search to help identify data used as evidence in legal cases. Content Search helps identify relevant data directly in Microsoft 365, reducing the amount of data that customers need to prepare and export to their third-party compliance tools. Advanced eDiscovery builds on the core eDiscovery solution, helping organizations respond more quickly with a streamlined end-to-end eDiscovery workflow, intelligent search capabilities to decrease manual work, and save on third-party storage costs.

      - content: "Searching based on conditions and keywords, and refining content with advanced analytics."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While this may seem correct at the surface, the key differentiator is eDiscovery is used to filter the massive volume of data that is analyzed so the results for review are most relevant to an investigation or regulatory request."

        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The traditional method of performing eDiscovery typically involved going out and collecting vast amounts of data from various distributed sources and storing them in a central location (usually off-site) in order to then have them indexed and searched to start the process of identifying the relevant data. In many cases, this would take place at a third-party vendor."
