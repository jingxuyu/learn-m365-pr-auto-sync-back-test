quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which type of hold in Exchange Server is either enabled or disabled for a mailbox?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-place hold"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An In-Place Hold preserves only those items that meet the criteria of a search query that you define by using the In-Place eDiscovery tool. You can place multiple In-Place Holds on a mailbox. Try again."
    - content: "Litigation hold"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Litigation Hold is either enabled or disabled for a mailbox. When Litigation Hold is enabled for a mailbox, all items in the mailbox are placed on hold."
    - content: "Discovery hold"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There is no such hold as a Discovery hold. If a user is put on an In-Place hold, deleted items are moved to the DiscoveryHolds folder. Try again."
