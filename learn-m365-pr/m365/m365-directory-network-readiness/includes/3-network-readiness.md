There are three main components in a deployment that will have an impact on your network: PC imaging, software updates, and user personalization. Between them, this can mean in excess of 20 GB per PC for the initial migration, and often 1 GB or more per month per PC to stay up-to-date.

## PC imaging
For Windows Images with no customization you should plan typically for 3GB per PC, while for customized images with apps you may need to allow 6GB, or more. You may also need to consider Driver packages; these can be a few hundred megabytes per PC, sometimes up to 1GB.

## Software updates
Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus use a new servicing model delivering monthly and semi-annual updates, covered later in this learning path. The new servicing model includes Feature Updates for Windows twice a year, Office Semi-Annual Channel Updates, and monthly Quality Updates. Feature Updates are typically 2 – 4GB in size, and Office Semi-Annual Channel updates are 300 – 400 MB per update. Monthly Quality Updates may range from a few hundred megabytes to over a gigabyte because monthly updates are cumulative, so these increase in size over the servicing lifetime for each Windows 10 version. However, Microsoft offers tools to help reduce the amount of data that must pass over the network to implement updates covered later in this module.

## User personalization
The third component to consider is user personalization. Here you’ll need to plan network bandwidth to accommodate the restoring of user files, their settings, and their applications as part of the PC refresh or replacement process. Together, these items often exceed 20 GB per PC; for some users these may exceed 100 GB.
