In this module, you learned that a threat vector is a path or means by which a hacker, or “threat actor”, can gain access to a target. The target can be anything of value to the hacker. You learned that common targets include:

 *  Computers and servers
 *  Usernames and passwords (known as account credentials)
 *  Personal information
 *  Financial information
 *  An organization’s plans for a new marketing campaign

In this module, you examined the types of threats vectors and their potential outcomes that organizations must deal with each day. You learned how various techniques are used to trick users into providing personal information – including account credentials - and how users may enable hackers to access a target by unwittingly executing malicious content.

This module examined the techniques hackers use to compromise user accounts through email. It also examined the techniques hackers use to gain control over resources.

To address these issues, you learned how to mitigate an account breach, how to prevent an elevation of privilege attack, and how to prevent data exfiltration, data deletion, and data spillage.
