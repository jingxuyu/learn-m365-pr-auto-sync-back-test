## Skype for Business vs. Teams
Microsoft recently announced its intention to move Office 365 and Microsoft 365 Skype for Business users to Teams. If youâ€™re a current Skype for Business Online user, what does this mean for you? Furthermore, if you are currently considering implementing a collaborative platform, should you choose Skype for Business Online or opt for Teams. 
(CONTENT PLACEHOLDER - question is not answered)

>[!NOTE]
> Microsoft Teams is now the primary client for messaging, meetings and calling in Office 365. Soon, new Office 365 customers with 500 users or less will be onboarded to Microsoft Teams and will no longer have access to Skype for Business Online. Tenants that are already using Skype for Business Online will be able to continue doing so (including provisioning new users) until they complete their transition to Microsoft Teams. 

You can discover more about the transition from Skype for Business to Teams by visiting the following website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/faq-journey.
