![A diagram showing the three principles of security monitoring. - Alerting must be robust: we need to have signals and logic for a variety of different attacker behaviors. - Alerting must be accurate: we have to raise meaningful alerts, to avoid distractions from noise. - Alerting must be fast: we have to catch attackers quickly enough to stop them.](../media/security-monitoring-principles.png)

Microsoft 365 engages in continuous security monitoring of its systems to detect and respond to threats to Microsoft 365 Services. Automation, scale, and cloud-based solutions are key pillars of our monitoring and response strategy. For us to effectively catch and stop attacks at the scale of some of the Microsoft 365 core services, our monitoring systems need to automatically raise highly accurate alerts in near real time. Likewise, when an issue is detected, we need the ability to mitigate the risk at scale â€“ we cannot rely on our team to manually fix issues machine-by-machine. To mitigate risks at scale, we use cloud-based tools to automatically apply countermeasures and provide engineers with tools to apply approved mitigations quickly across the environment.

## Centralized logging and telemetry

Microsoft 365 uses centralized logging to collect and analyze log events for activity that might indicate a security incident. Centralized logging tools aggregate logs from all system components, including event logs, application logs, access control logs, and network-based intrusion detection systems. In addition to server logging and application level data, core infrastructure in our service is equipped with customized security agents that generate detailed telemetry and provide host-based intrusion detection. We use this telemetry for monitoring and forensics.

The logging and telemetry data we collect enables 24/7 security monitoring with Near Real-Time processing and alerting. Our alerting system analyzes log data and telemetry using sophisticated machine learning models and produces alerts within 15 minutes of suspicious activity taking place. Our monitoring logic goes beyond generic attack scenarios and incorporates deep awareness of service architecture and operations. We use security monitoring data to continuously improve our models to detect new kinds of attacks and improve the accuracy of our security monitoring.

## Responding at scale

When we need to take an action in response to an alert or to further investigate forensic evidence throughout the service, our cloud-based tools allow us to respond rapidly throughout the environment. These tools include fully automated, intelligent agents that respond to detected threats with security countermeasures. In many cases, these agents deploy automatic countermeasures to mitigate security detections at scale without human intervention. When this is not possible, the security monitoring system automatically alerts the appropriate On-Call Engineers, who are equipped with a set of tools that enable them to act in real time to mitigate detected threats at scale. Potential incidents detected by security monitoring are escalated to the Microsoft 365 Security Response team and resolved using the security incident response process.
