Exchange and SharePoint have become a reliable and common medium for communication and collaboration between information workers in organizations of all sizes. Mailboxes and document libraries have become repositories of valuable data. As a best practice, organizations should establish policies and provide guidelines to users about how to use messaging and document systems responsibly, including how data is stored. Organizations must also create policies to manage the life cycle of email and documents. These policies may require system administrators to:

 -  Keep messages and documents for a length of time based on business, legal, and regulatory requirements.
 -  Preserve mailbox data and documents for litigation and investigation purposes.
 -  Prepare to search for and provide the required messaging and document records to fulfill eDiscovery requests.

This module examines how organizations can use archive mailboxes to manage the retention of mail items the organization must keep, and the removal of mail items they don't want to keep. It also explores how organizations can use records management in Microsoft 365 to manage their high-value content for legal, business, or regulatory obligations.

The module concludes by examining how to restore deleted data in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. You'll learn the restoration process of deleted Exchange Online data is a two step process - recover the deleted data and then restore the recovered data. You'll also learn that restoring deleted data in SharePoint Online involves two recycle bins - the Site recycle bin and the Site Collection recycle bin.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Enable and disable an archive mailbox in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal and through Windows PowerShell.
 -  Run diagnostic tests on an archive mailbox.
 -  Learn how retention labels can be used to allow or block actions when documents and emails are declared records.
 -  Create your file plan for retention and deletion settings and actions.
