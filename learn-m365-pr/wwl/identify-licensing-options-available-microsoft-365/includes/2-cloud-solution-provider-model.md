Microsoft offers various licensing programs that are channels where you can buy Microsoft 365 products and services. These programs include Microsoft Volume Licensing (VL), Cloud Solution Provider program (CSP), or Web Direct programs (MOSP). For example, in Volume Licensing, Microsoft 365 is available for customers through the Enterprise Agreement (EA). If you want a dedicated expert to provide hands-on support, Microsoft has many qualified partners in their Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program who can help.

### **Cloud Solution Provider model** 

The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) model is a Microsoft partner program that provides the expertise and services you need through an expert CSP partner.

Your Microsoft 365 subscription is provided through a CSP partner who can manage your entire subscription, provide billing and technical support. The CSP partner will have admin privileges that will allow them to access your tenant. They'll have the ability to directly support, configure and manage licenses and settings. The CSP partner can provide extra consultancy and advice to ensure security and productivity targets are met. Furthermore, other Microsoft cloud-based products and services can be added to your subscription such as Microsoft Azure services and Dynamics 365.

The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program provides a pay-as-you-go subscription model with per-user, per-month pricing that enables your business to scale up or down from month to month as your needs change.

### **Enterprise Agreements**

The Microsoft Enterprise Agreement (EA) is designed for organizations that want to license software and cloud services for a minimum three-year period. The Enterprise Agreement offers the best value to organizations with 500 or more users or devices. One of the benefits of the Enterprise Agreement is that it's manageable, giving you the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under a single organization-wide agreement.
