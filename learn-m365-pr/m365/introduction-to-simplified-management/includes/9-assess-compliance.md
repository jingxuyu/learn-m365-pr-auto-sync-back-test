Over the years, governmental and other agencies have become interested in how we use and share data. This is particularly relevant when dealing with personal data, such as financial and health data. 

To help protect individuals, governments and the agencies that they appoint have introduced regulations about data storage and use. These regulations include:

- Granting people, the right to access, and possibly correct, data stored about them.
- Defining a data retention period. 
- Granting governments and their appointed regulatory bodies the rights to access stored records for investigative purposes. 
- Defining exactly how stored data can and cannot be used. In other words, defining the purpose for the collated data. 
- Defining privacy controls so that private data can remain private.

Organizations must comply with a number of governmental regulations regarding data privacy and access.  Itâ€™s estimated that there are over 200 updates from over 700 regulatory bodies each day. Trying to keep up-to-date with regulatory changes can be challenging.
