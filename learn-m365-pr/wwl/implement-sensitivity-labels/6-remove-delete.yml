  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer deleted a sensitivity label that applied encryption for Highly Confidential documents. Holly later used the desktop version of Word to open a document the label had been applied to. What happened when Holly opened the document?"
    choices:
    - content: "The label information in the metadata was removed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When opening a document using a desktop app, the label information in the metadata remains even though the label was deleted. Try again."
    - content: "The encryption remained in the content"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When opening a document using a desktop app, if the label applied encryption, the encryption remains when the content is opened."
    - content: "Holly was still able to see the applied label name displayed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. By using a desktop app to open the document, Holly won't see the applied label name displayed. Try again."
