quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso has implemented an Edge Transport server to provide a secure SMTP gateway for all incoming and outgoing Internet email in the organization. The Edge Transport server will enable Contoso to maintain a secure border between external SMTP mail and its internal Exchange 2019 servers. It will also provide anti-spam protection. Which of the following methods can Contoso use to provide anti-malware protection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Through the Edge Transport role in Exchange Server 2019"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Exchange Server 2019’s Edge Transport role doesn't include anti-malware agents. Try again,"
    - content: "Through Azure IoT Edge Transport rules"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Edge Transport rules control the flow of messages that are sent to, or received from, the Internet. They don't provide anti-malware protection. Try again."
    - content: "Through Exchange Online Protection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Exchange Server 2019’s Edge Transport role doesn't include anti-malware agents. If you don't want to rely upon Exchange 2019 Mailbox servers to provide anti-malware protection, you must use either Microsoft products such as Exchange Online Protection, or third-party software that integrates with Exchange Server 2019 to provide anti-malware protection."
