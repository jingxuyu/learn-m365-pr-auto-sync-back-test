# Enforce secure devices

## Ensure that administrators use compliant devices

It’s best practice to ensure that devices used for administrative tasks comply with your security policies. For example, an organization might require that users can only access sensitive resources by using devices that are managed by your organization.

With Azure AD Conditional Access, you can require that an administrator’s device be registered with Azure AD and identified as compliant by Microsoft Intune.

A device that Azure AD marks as compliant ensures that it:

- Is managed by your organization.
- Complies with company security requirements.
