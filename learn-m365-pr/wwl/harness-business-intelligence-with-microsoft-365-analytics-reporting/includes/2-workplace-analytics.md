Being more productive doesn’t necessarily mean working harder, or longer hours. Often, being more productive means making time to concentrate on high priority work or collaborating with the right people. Workplace Analytics and MyAnalytics gather data and use AI to provide insights into the working habits of individuals and organizations.

## Workplace Analytics

Microsoft 365 Workplace Analytics uses data from how people are currently working to identify areas where they might be more productive. There are a variety of metrics to help you understand your organization’s data and working practices:

- **Week in the life** gives a summary of day-to-day collaboration in the organization.
- **Meetings overview** gives a summary of meeting norms within your organization.
- **Management and coaching** gives a summary of collaboration between leaders, managers, and employees.
- **Internal networks** shows network connections between different people within a company exclusively, for example, between the sales department and the human resources department.
- **External collaboration** gives a summary of employees' network patterns with people outside the company.
- **Teams collaboration** shows insights and communication trends about how your organization's employees use Teams for communication and collaboration.

Workplace Analytics identifies collaboration patterns that may impact productivity, workforce effectiveness, and employee engagement. It has several benefits:

- The data is generated from people’s actual working patterns.
- There is no disruption or additional work required.
- It has built-in dashboards and reports that visualize the data.
- It generates insights to learn and identifies improve the way you work.

Workspace Analytics has been designed to help organizations identify trends across countries, departments, or teams. Organizational culture plays a large part in how we work. With Microsoft 365 Workplace Analytics, organizations can identify working patterns across similar groups, and consider changes that might help people work more effectively.

Workplace Analytics roles are assigned so that administrators can set system defaults, privacy settings, and upload and verify organizational data. Data analysts can log into and use Workplace Analytics after data is provisioned. See [Assign Workplace Analytics roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/workplace-analytics/setup/assign-roles-to-wpa-admins).

> By default Workplace Analytics does not include personal data in its reports. However, there is potential sensitivity about how data could be used. Successful implementation of Workplace Analytics requires careful thought and planning, particularly with regard to data protection.

## MyAnalytics

MyAnalytics provides insights into two of the key factors in personal productivity: how people spend their time and who they spend it with. You and your team can get these benefits after an administrator sets up MyAnalytics within your organization. MyAnalytics is delivered as an email every week. Alternatively, go to https://myanalytics.microsoft.com to access your personal dashboard. Metrics include:

The MyAnalytics dashboard opens to the **Home** page that shows you statistics about your work patterns over the past month, including your focus and collaboration time, how many days you were able to disconnect from work, and how effectively you are networking with your coworkers.

Individual MyAnalytics goals can be set by finding the relevant metric and setting a measurable goal. You can set goals to increase your focus time, or attend fewer ineffective meetings, and get feedback each week on how you are doing.
