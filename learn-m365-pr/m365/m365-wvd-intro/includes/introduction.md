Microsoft’s **Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD)** solution on Microsoft Azure is a fully managed desktop virtualization solution. WVD works across devices – including Windows, Mac, iOS and Android – with full-featured apps that you can use to access remote desktops and remote apps; additionally most modern browsers can also be used to access WVD hosted experiences. 

Compared to traditional Remote Desktop Services (RDS) or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments, Windows Virtual Desktop is simpler to deploy and manage. Component services and servers like the gateway, connection broker, diagnostics, load balancing, and licensing no longer need to be provisioned or managed. WVD allows you to use the only Windows client-based operating system that enables multiple concurrent user logins to a single virtual machine (VM), Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session, which provides a more consistent experience with broader application support compared to Windows Server-based operating systems. 

In addition to separating the remote session’s data from the user’s device, Windows Virtual Desktop also improves security compared to the Remote Desktop Protocol (port 3389) by using a secure outbound connection. Furthermore, the integration of FSLogix profiles allows user profile data to be containerized in a separate virtual disk. The user’s virtual disk dynamically attaches in real time to any WVD virtual machine that user logs in to, so local files feel as if they are running from the local C:\ drive. 

Windows Virtual Desktop gives you options to load balance users on your virtual machine host pools. Host pools are collections of virtual machines with a common configuration and assigned to multiple users. For best performance you can configure load balancing as users log in for breadth mode, to evenly allocate your users across host pool for your workload. And to save costs, you can configure your VMs for Depth Mode load balancing. Depth mode the load balancing fully allocates users on a VM before moving to the next. WVD provides tools to automate the provisioning of additional VMs as needed once a specified threshold is met to support additional incoming demand. 

As you progress through this training following the Prepare > Deploy > Optimize steps you’ll notice that the setup process abstracts many of the infrastructure roles you might have deployed for RDS in the past, so the initial provisioning is focused on hybrid integration and deploying host pools, while configuration and day-to-day operations focus on session host, identity, app and storage management.
