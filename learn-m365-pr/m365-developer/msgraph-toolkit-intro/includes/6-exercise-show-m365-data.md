In this exercise, you practice using Microsoft Graph Toolkit components in your application, and showing data from Microsoft 365.

## Before you start

Before you do this exercise, be sure to complete the first exercise in this module.

## Add the Agenda component in your app

You already completed the steps required for handling authentication in the previous exercise. Now, you'll show upcoming calendar events in the application for a signed-in user. Add the Agenda component in the body of your *index.html* file:

```html
<mgt-agenda></mgt-agenda>
```

The final version of your *index.html* file will look as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>    
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>    
        <mgt-msal2-provider client-id="YOUR-CLIENT-ID"></mgt-msal2-provider>
        <mgt-login></mgt-login>
        <mgt-agenda></mgt-agenda>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Test your app in a browser

Follow these steps to test your app in a browser:

1. If it's your first time using **Microsoft 365 developer tenant**, you might not have any events in your Microsoft 365 developer tenant account's calendar. Before you start testing your app, visit https://outlook.office.com/calendar, and sign in with your **Microsoft 365 developer tenant** account. Add sample events for upcoming days in your calendar.

2. In Visual Studio Code, run **Live Server** to test your app. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

3. Make sure to sign in with your **Microsoft 365 developer tenant** account. Consent to the required calendar permissions, and select **Accept**.

4. Your app will show your upcoming calendar events:
