  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to use address lists to sort the company's GAL into multiple views. Holly's goal is to make it easier for Fabrikam's users to locate recipients. Holly wants to configure address lists with recipient filters that will determine the scope of recipients and add conditional filtering based on properties such as company, department, and state or region. Which type of recipient filter should Holly use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Hierarchical address list filters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A hierarchical address list isn't a type of recipient filter. Rather, it's a subcategory of address lists. Try again."
    - content: "Custom filters"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the type of recipient filter that Holly should use. Try again."
    - content: "Pre-canned filters"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A pre-canned filter is a commonly used Exchange filter that you can use to meet various recipient-filtering criteria for creating address lists. For example, using pre-canned filters, you can determine the scope of recipients and add conditional filtering based on properties such as company, department, and state or region."
