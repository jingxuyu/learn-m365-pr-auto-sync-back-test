This module examined how Co-management enables organizations to use modern management features with their current devices. These features include conditional access and strong authentication by using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).

The module then explored the two ways for organizations to prepare their existing environments for Co-management:

 -  **If an organization's devices are currently managed by Configuration Manager, but not yet by Intune, it must enroll them to Intune.** Depending on the company's size, it can achieve this goal in several different ways. For example, it can use provisioning packages, manual enrollment, or enrolling them by using Configuration Manager.
 -  **If an organization's devices are currently managed by Intune, but not yet by Configuration Manager, it must install the Configuration Manager client on the devices.** Organizations can install the client in several different ways. For example, they can use Intune app deployment or manual installation.

The module described how new devices can include the Configuration Manager client and yet be automatically enrolled to Intune during the deployment. You also learned that integrating Configuration Manager and Intune forms the basis of Co-management.

In this module, you examined how to prepare your Windows 10 devices for Co-management. You began by exploring the prerequisites for using Co-management. You then learned how to configure Configuration Manager for Co-management. The module concluded by showing you how to enroll your Windows 10 and later devices to Intune.
