**Resolution of module problem**

This company wanted to deploy a solution that supported their employees working remotely. This solution needed to be up-to-date, secure, and highly scalable. You found that Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop provided its users access to every system a physical desktop would provide.

This module addressed how to add strict identity and device verification regardless of the location of the user accessing company resources. This is the basis of the Zero Trust security model. This model protects corporate data and resources while ensuring that organizations can build a modern workplace using technologies like WVD, that empower employees to be productive anytime, anywhere.

In this module, we reviewed many of the security features that create an extra layer of security that doesnâ€™t rely only on the device itself. These features included:

- Security aspects of WVD architecture, including a shared responsibility model
- How to utilize Azure AD identity management services
- Securing session hosts and applications
- Storage security
- Network security
- Threat protection and analytics

Windows Virtual Desktop offers significant benefits to businesses including the flexibility to scale up or down, increase security, create an infrastructure, and reduce labor costs.
