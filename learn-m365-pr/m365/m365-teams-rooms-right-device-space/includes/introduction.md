There's lots of considerations before purchasing Microsoft Teams Rooms. You'll need to understand what the various components are that make up Teams Rooms. When should you use microphones on a table versus putting them in the ceiling? Should you use one or two displays in the front of the room? How should you inventory and analyze your rooms to make sure you're putting the right devices into the right spaces?

In this module, you'll learn what to consider when looking at your various meeting room spaces. This includes the obvious (how significant is the room) to the less obvious (how are the acoustics?). You'll learn what to look for when designing Teams Rooms spaces.

Finally, you'll gain an appreciation of all the crucial elements needed to document a room. This documentation is valuable not only during the design and installation of Teams Rooms but also in the ongoing operations in years to come.
