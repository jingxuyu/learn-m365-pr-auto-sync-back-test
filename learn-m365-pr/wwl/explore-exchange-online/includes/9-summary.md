In this module, you learned about Exchange Online, which is part of the Microsoft 365 suite of products. Exchange Online is a collaboration service that provides organizations with a safe and efficient way to send and receive email traffic, schedule meetings, assign tasks, and book resources. Exchange Online has many features that allow companies to adopt and adapt to todayâ€™s ever-changing concerns about security, integrity, and compliance needs.

Exchange Online standardizes each of these features in its everyday use; they're also backed by a Microsoft service level agreement (SLA) with its customers. This module examined several of these key features, including:

 -  Creating and managing recipients
 -  Managing anti-malware and anti-spam policies
 -  Managing disaster recovery needs
 -  Planning migration strategies

You learned that Exchange Online uses several anti-spam technologies to minimize incoming spam messages. It scans incoming messages and stores the results in the Anti-spam Message Headers that are part of every SMTP message. Additionally, it saves the spam confidence level (SCL) as part of this header; the SCL includes the likeliness that the message is spam.

This module also explained how Exchange Online provides over a dozen data centers that can restore your company's data back to the nearest minute should a disaster strike. It also provides other ways to manage and track company and user emails. You also learned how Exchange Online uses In-Place Archiving to provide an extra user mailbox for storing older messages, such as calendar items that are no longer of immediate importance.

Microsoft 365 provides a range of migration options that organizations must consider before moving their email data to Exchange Online. These options involve both migration and coexistence strategies. This module examined the features of each strategy and the scenarios in which each strategy is typically used.
