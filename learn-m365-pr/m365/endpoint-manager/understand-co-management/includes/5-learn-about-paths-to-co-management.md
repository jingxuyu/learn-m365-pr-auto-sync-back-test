There are two primary ways for you to set up co-management. It's important to understand the prerequisites for each path. They each require some combination of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, and Windows 10.

Once you decide to move to Configuration Manager or extend your existing Configuration Manager solution, there are two main paths to reach co-management:

- **Enable co-management for existing Configuration Manager clients** (Path 1)
- **Enable co-management for new internet-based devices** (Path 2)

## Enable co-management for existing Configuration Manager clients

You have Windows 10 devices that are already Configuration Manager clients. You set up hybrid Azure AD, and enroll them into Intune. With co-management, you can keep your well-established processes for using Configuration Manager to manage PCs in your organization. At the same time, you're investing in the cloud through use of Intune for security and modern provisioning.

## Enable co-management for new internet-based devices

You have new Windows 10 devices that join Azure AD and automatically enroll to Intune. You install the Configuration Manager client to reach a co-management state.
