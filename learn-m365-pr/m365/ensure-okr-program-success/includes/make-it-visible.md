The last strategy for ensuring program success is to make the change visible to your team. Making change visible not only keeps OKRs top of mind for new users, but it also increases familiarity with a new product. 

While there are many strategies for making a new change visible, here are three strategies for OKRs that are helpful: example-based leadership, using reminders, and habit-stacking.

## Lead by example

OKR Champions should lead by example, demonstrating how OKRs emerge in daily work rhythms. Rather than simply talking about how the company is doing in town hall meetings, OKR Champions can reinforce OKRs by contextualizing it with OKR progress.

In team and one-on-one meetings, OKR Champions should use dashboards to keep agendas and check in on OKR progress. This keeps everyone regularly exposed to Viva Goals, sets the expectation that they'll be regularly using the solution, and increases familiarity on how it can be used.

## Use reminders

Leverage the [nudge feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/viva/goals/nudge-users-to-check-in?azure-portal=true) in Viva Goals. Reminders drive repetitive behavior and encourage long-term usage. Help your team adopt Viva Goals by setting a nudge to remind you and your team to update your OKRs at the same time each week.

## Stack habits

Habit-stacking is a strategy for implementing new behavior that groups together small activities and links them to an established habit. If someone wanted to start drinking more water, for example, and they already had a morning routine of drinking coffee, they could stack a new habit of drinking one glass of water while they make their coffee.

This strategy works well for building OKR rhythms. If you already have a weekly team meeting, stack a new habit of performing a check-in on your OKR before the meeting. Soon you'll associate the new habit of, "when I get the meeting alert, I'll do my check-in so I'm prepared for the meeting." OKR Champions should share this tip with their teammates and make it clear that OKRs will be a regular part of meetings.

These three strategies for making the change to OKRs visible can have significant impacts on the long-term success of an OKR program. OKR Champions should strategize at the beginning on how to incorporate these strategies into their daily work rhythms.
