One of the key responsibilities of the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator (EA) is management of the company tenant. For example, when configuring the tenant, the EA may need to acquire and assign other licenses such as Project Online, Visio, or SharePoint Designer. Other times, the EA may need to purchase extra storage.

These add-on services can all be found in the **Purchase Services** tab located under the **Billing** section of the Microsoft 365 admin center. When accessing this site, Microsoft 365 displays both individual and full suite options. Some of the subscriptions provide a standard 30-day trial before the service add-on becomes degraded and must be paid for.

To assign these services, you can either:

 -  Purchase the service add-on, then go to the **User** tab, locate the user, and then assign the license to the user’s account.

‎ or

 -  Select the **Assign to** option once the license has been claimed and add it to the user’s account.
