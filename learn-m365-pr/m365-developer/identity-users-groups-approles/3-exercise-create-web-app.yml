  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can you restrict your app to only allow specific users to sign in and use it with Microsoft identity?"
    choices:
    - content: "Enable the **User assignment required** setting on the app in the Azure AD admin center and assign specific users to the app."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Disable the **Allow all users to sign in** setting on the app in the Azure AD admin center and assign specific users to the app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There is no property **Allow all users to sign in**; all users can sign in to Azure AD apps unless the **User assignment required** setting is enabled."
    - content: "Remove the **Everyone** group from the list of users allowed to sign in to the Azure AD app and assign specific users to the app."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The **Everyone** group isn't added by default to the list of users allowed to use the app, nor is the **User assignment required** setting enabled by default."
  - content: "What elements are required to create, configure or collect when registering an Azure AD app for use with an ASP.NET Core web app?"
    choices:
    - content: "Tenant ID, application ID, application secret, and the redirect URI"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Application ID, application secret, and the redirect URI."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The tenant ID is also required when setting the authority in the Azure AD configuration."
    - content: "Tenant ID, application ID, and the application secret."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The redirect URI is also required because Azure AD needs to know where to redirect the user after a successful sign-in."
