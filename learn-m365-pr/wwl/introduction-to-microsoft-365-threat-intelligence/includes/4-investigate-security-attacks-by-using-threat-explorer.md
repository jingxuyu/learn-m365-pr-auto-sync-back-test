Threat Explorer provides a powerful report that enables an organization's Security Operations team to effectively and efficiently investigate and respond to threats. Where the Threat Dashboard provides C-level executives a broad view of the threat landscape, Threat Explorer enables security analysts and admins to drill down and understand details related to threats targeting their tenant.

With Threat Explorer, organizations can:

 -  see malware detected by Microsoft 365 security features.
 -  view data about phishing URLs and selection verdict.
 -  start an automated investigation and response process from a view in Explorer (Microsoft Defender Plan 2 only).
 -  preview email header and download email body.
 -  view Email timeline.
 -  export URL selection data.
 -  find and investigate malicious email that was delivered.
 -  view malicious files detected in SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.
 -  get an overview of the views in Threat Explorer (and real-time detections).

Threat Explorer provides a color-coded chart that represents attacks that are targeted at an organization. This pane has a tabbed view of top malware families, an email list, and a map of email origins. It also displays the top targeted users in an organization.

The default view displays malware by threat family. But you can also choose to display other views, such as phish or all email. You can get more granular by using filters to display all email or malware by subject, sender domain, sender IP, protection status, detection technology, and much more.

Threat Explorer enables you to drill down and view reports and recommendations written by cyber hunters who partner with Microsoft to help you make informed decisions.
