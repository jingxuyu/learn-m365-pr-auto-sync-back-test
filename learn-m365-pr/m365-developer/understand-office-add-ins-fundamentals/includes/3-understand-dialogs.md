The Office Add-ins platform enables you to display a dialog for your users to:

- Sign into an integrated service (for example, authenticate with Microsoft Account, Google, or Facebook).
- Confirm the user's action.
- Run a task that might be too confined in a task pane (for example, view a video).

The dialog window is not modal, meaning that your user can continue to interact with the Office application and your add-in while the dialog window is displayed. The following image shows a dialog being displayed in an Office application.
