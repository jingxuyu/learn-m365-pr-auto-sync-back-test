Microsoft Teams Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) provides a summary view of an organization's calls and meetings on a monthly, daily, or hourly basis. It enables an organization to investigate problems based on quality, failure, and in-product user feedback. 

CQD is designed to help Microsoft Teams administrators, Skype for Business admins, and network engineers monitor call and meeting quality at an organization-wide level. The near real-time data enables Teams admins to quickly resolve troubleshooting efforts by drilling down to find where issues originated, and who was affected.

Suppose a user's poor call quality is because of a network issue that also affects other users. The individual call experience isn't visible in CQD, but the overall quality of calls made using Microsoft Teams is captured.

> [!NOTE]
> Wherever CQD includes end-user identifiable information (EUII) data, it's managed in the same way as EUII throughout Microsoft 365.

## Permissions to access Call Quality Dashboard  

Employees who aren't administrators, such as help desk agents, can use CQD if they're assigned the Teams Communications Support Engineer, Teams Communications Support Specialist, or Reports Reader role.

Users with the following roles can access the Call Quality Dashboard:

* Global Administrator
* Global Reader
* Skype for Business Administrator
* Teams Service Administrator

## The Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) in Teams admin center

CQD data can be accessed using several different methods, including:

* Teams admin center
* CQD portal (Teams admin center >Analytics & Reports > Call Quality Dashboard)
* Graph API
* Power BI

When you first sign into the CQD Portal, you'll see the summary reports. These show daily and monthly call quality trends. Call quality is classified as good, poor, or unclassified.

In the Product Filter, select **All**, **Microsoft Teams**, or **Skype for Business**. Using the tabs, select **Overall Call Quality**, **Server-Client**, **Client-Client**, or **Voice Quality SLA**.
