The [MS-900 - Microsoft 365 Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/microsoft-365-fundamentals) certification exam is designed for those looking to demonstrate foundational knowledge on the considerations and benefits of adopting cloud services in general and the Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud model. Candidates should also have knowledge of available options and benefits gained by implementing Microsoft 365 cloud service offerings. 

The exam is intended for candidates with non-technical backgrounds, such as candidates involved in selling or purchasing cloud-based solutions and services. It is also designed for candidates who have some involvement with cloud-based solutions and services, as well as candidates with a technical background who have a need to validate their foundational level knowledge around cloud services. Technical IT experience is not required however some general IT knowledge or experience would be beneficial.

This exam can be taken as an optional first step in learning concepts about cloud services or as a precursor to other Microsoft cloud services exams. While it would be a beneficial first step in validating foundational level knowledge, taking this exam is not a pre-requisite for taking any other Microsoft 365-based certifications.
