Modern messaging environments often have complex retention requirements. As such, itâ€™s essential to understand how archiving is accomplished in Microsoft Exchange to support message retention. This understanding enables messaging administrators to provide an efficient and compliant environment to their users.

To support this effort, this module began by examining in-place archiving and auditing in Exchange Online. Implementing and managing in-place archiving is a process that requires considerable planning. As such, it's important that you understand how archive storage is provided to your users. It's also important that you understand how messages are automatically processed and archived.

The module then examined journaling in Exchange. Journaling can help an organization respond to legal, regulatory, and organizational compliance requirements. It supports this effort by recording all or targeted email messages.

The module concluded with an exploration of audit logging. Audit logging is another key aspect of messaging compliance. Audit logging in Exchange provides information about administrator, delegate, and user actions in user mailboxes and your Exchange organization.
