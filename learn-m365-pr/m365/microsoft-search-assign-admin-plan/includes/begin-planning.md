When it comes to finding information and getting answers, knowing your usersâ€™ needs and pain points is key. This will help ensure that Microsoft Search delivers the information that people in your organization want and need. Here are just a few things to consider:

- High-traffic sites or pages.
- Known user pain points when searching for information.
- Frequently used apps, tools, sites, and other information sources. For example, people looking for tools to book time off or instructions on how to reset a password
- Policies or processes about employee benefits and enrollment information that's needed on a recurring basis, either seasonally or based on business cycles. Expense reports, quarterly reports, or company meetings, for example.
- Events, retreats, and conferences sponsored by the organization or that people regularly attend.
- Frequently asked questions and answers to resolve common IT and HR issues.

The admins from our scenario have compiled a list of information needed by their users. At the top of their list? An answer that shows users how to reset their password on their own. After reviewing their help desk data, they're confident Microsoft Search can significantly reduce the number of support tickets by answering this common question. Their next step is to build an editorial answer from the Microsoft 365 admin center.
