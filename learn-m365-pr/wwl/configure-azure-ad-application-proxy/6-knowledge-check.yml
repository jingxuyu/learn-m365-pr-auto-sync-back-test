  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following items is a lightweight agent that sits on-premises and supports the outbound connection to the Application Proxy service?"
    choices:
    - content: "Kerberos Constrained Delegation"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. If an application uses Integrated Windows Authentication, Application Proxy provides single sign-on to the app by impersonating the user using Kerberos Constrained Delegation. Kerberos Constrained Delegation isn't the lightweight agent that supports outbound connect to the Application Proxy."
    - content: "Connector"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The connector is a lightweight agent that sits on a Windows Server inside your network. The connector controls the traffic flow from the Application Proxy service in the cloud to your application on-premises. It only uses outbound connections, so you don't have to open any inbound ports or put anything in the perimeter network."
    - content: "External endpoint"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An external endpoint is how your users reach your applications while outside of your network."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Adventure Works Cycles, Holly Spencer wants to publish on-premises applications for remote access by Adventure Works' customers and partners. Because Adventure Works has a large deployment, Holly wants to improve latency for tenants that have applications hosted in different regions. Which of the following items is required when publishing on-premises applications for remote access that will achieve this goal?"
    choices:
    - content: "DNS TXT file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't required to publish on-premises applications for remote access."
    - content: "Short Backend Application Timeout"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't required to publish on-premises applications for remote access."
    - content: "Location-based connector groups"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Connector groups make it easier to manage large deployments. Because location-based connector groups can be created to serve only local applications, they can improve latency for tenants that have applications hosted in different regions."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Alan Deyoung has implemented Azure AD Application Proxy. Doing so enables Northwind to support remote workers by publishing on-premises applications to be accessed over the internet. Alan has organized Northwind's connectors into connector groups, with each group handling traffic to specific applications. To optimize Northwind's network structure, Alan also wants to implement load-balancing. What should Alan do next to load-balance this traffic to specific applications?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alan should deploy at least two connectors"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Deploying at least two connectors helps support high availability."
    - content: "Alan should verify the Microsoft Azure AD Application Proxy Connector service is running"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This service enables connectivity but does not impact load-balancing."
    - content: "There's nothing else that Alan must do"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "correct. No more steps are required because connectors load-balance automatically."
