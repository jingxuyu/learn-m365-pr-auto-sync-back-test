Mobile Application Management (MAM) can be used to publish, push, configure, secure, monitor, and update mobile apps in an organization. MAM can be used without enrollment (MAM-WE), where a work or school-related app that contains sensitive data can be managed, including personal devices (BYOD). MAM can also be used with Intune MDM device enrollment so that administrators can both manage apps using MAM and set app protection policies on devices via Intune MDM. App protection policies in MAM can be enabled and used through either the Intune App Wrapping Tool or from the Intune App SDK. App protection policies target a user's identity and can be assigned to either Intune enrolled or unenrolled iOS and Android devices that can be managed through the Endpoint Manager admin center.
