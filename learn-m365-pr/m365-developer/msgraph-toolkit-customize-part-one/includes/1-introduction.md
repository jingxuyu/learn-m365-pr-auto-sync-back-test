Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of components and authentication providers that helps you connect with Microsoft Graph. The components are reusable HTML tags that are fully functional prebuilt experiences to get data from Microsoft 365.

The components provide access to popular Microsoft 365 datasets with the power of Microsoft Graph. They help you demonstrate the data with a prebuilt UI, which looks and feels like Microsoft 365 experiences. Also, the components are flexible for customization if you want to match their styling with your branding.

## Scenario

Suppose you're building a web app that shows a user's upcoming meetings stored in Microsoft 365. Your app is styled to match your organization's brand identity. The data you retrieve from Microsoft 365 should be seamlessly integrated in your app. You want to use Microsoft Graph Toolkit to easily retrieve the data from Microsoft 365, but you need to style how it shows the data. You also need to ensure that all data required by the stakeholders is displayed on the page.
