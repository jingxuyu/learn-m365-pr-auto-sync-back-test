  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Inc. You're reviewing the different identity strategies that Microsoft 365 provides for companies to authenticate into its services. As part of your review, you're looking for the strategy that has the least setup requirements. Which of the following identity strategies meets this Fabrikam business requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Password Hash Synchronization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This strategy has more setup requirements than the correct answer. Try again."
    - content: "Cloud Only"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This strategy has the least setup compared to the other identity strategies - all that is needed is a subscription and a sign-in account."
    - content: "Azure AD Pass-Through Authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This strategy has more setup requirements than the correct answer. Try again."
  - content: "Tailspin Toys wants to remediate Active Directory identity issues when onboarding to Microsoft 365. It wants to specifically focus on the Windows Server Active Directory errors reported by Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync, which Tailspin plans to use as its directory synchronization tool. What should Tailspin Toys do to help clean up its Active Directory?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run Azure AD Smart Lockout"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Organizations run Azure AD Smart Lockout to protect on-premises accounts against brute force password attacks in the cloud. Try again."
    - content: "Run Azure AD Connect"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Azure AD Connect sync is a directory synchronization tool and not an AD clean-up tool. Try again."
    - content: "Run IdFix"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. IdFix enables organizations remediating the Windows Server Active Directory errors reported by Microsoft's directory synchronization tools, Azure AD Connect sync and Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync. The IdFix tool provides organizations with the ability to query, identify, and remediate the majority of object synchronization errors in their Window’s Server AD forests in preparation for deployment to Microsoft 365."

  - content: "As Fabrikam's Enterprise Administrator, you're planning a migration to Microsoft 365. You plan to authenticate all users in Azure Active Directory. As part of this process, the hashes of your users’ passwords must be replicated between Fabrikam's on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Which of the following identity types should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cloud Only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This strategy does not replicate hashes of user passwords from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD. Try again."
    - content: "Federated identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This strategy does not replicate hashes of user passwords from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD. Try again."
    - content: "Synchronized identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. With synchronized identities, hashes of user passwords are replicated from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD. When passwords are changed or reset on-premises, the new password hashes are immediately synchronized to Azure AD so that users can always use the same password for cloud resources and on-premises resources."
