Getting your team together for an online meeting is easier than ever. Meet with anyone, anywhere, and meet with intelligence and confidence.

## Meeting life cycle

Microsoft **Teams** helps you to reinvent the meeting life cycle and work more efficiently at every step. From scheduling to follow-up, when you are busy it can be difficult to manage everything. Teams saves you time and empowers you to get more done.

Teams provides rich functionality at every stage of meeting life cycle:

| **Before**                                                   | **During**                                                   | **After**                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Share the agenda,  invite colleagues and external guests, and provide previous meeting notes and  recordings. | Use video to make it  personal, share content, and create a recording with automatic transcription. | Share recordings and  notes, chat to your colleagues, and schedule your next meeting. |

Teams keeps everyone in touch, even when they can't be in the same room.

## Audio conferencing

Microsoft 365 audio conferencing lets users call in to meetings from their phones. So wherever people are, they can join a meeting using Teams. Up to 250 people can attend an audio conference call. People join meetings using a global dial-in number, either toll or toll-free.

Even when people have access to a computer, audio conferencing may be a good option if:

- Internet connectivity is limited
- The meeting is audio only
- The call quality is better when dialing in
- Someone wants “hands free” access using a Bluetooth device.

When you are setting up audio conferencing for Teams, you will get an audio conferencing bridge. A conferencing bridge can contain one or more phone numbers. The phone number you set will be included on the meeting invites for the Microsoft Teams app.

Although you only need to set up audio conferencing for people who plan to schedule or lead meetings. Meeting attendees who dial in don't need any licenses assigned to them or other setup.
