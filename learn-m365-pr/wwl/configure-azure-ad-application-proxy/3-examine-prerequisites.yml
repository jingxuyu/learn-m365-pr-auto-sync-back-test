  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Allan Deyoung is preparing Fabrikam's environment for Azure AD Application Proxy. Allan must prepare for Azure AD Application Proxy by enabling communication to which of the following items?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure data centers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To prepare your environment for Azure AD Application Proxy, you first need to enable communication to Azure data centers. If there's a firewall in the path, make sure that it's open so that the Connector can make HTTPS (TCP) requests to the Application Proxy."
    - content: "A server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Azure AD Application Proxy must be installed on a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or 2016. But to prepare your environment for Application proxy, this isn't the item to which communication must be enabled. Try again."
    - content: "Inbound traffic on port 443"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. To prepare for Azure AD Application Proxy, you must open open 443 to outbound traffic. Try again."
