In this module, you'll learn how to implement and manage public folder mailboxes and public folders. Implementing public folders requires a solid understanding of public folder permissions, and how to create and manage mail-enabled public folders.

The module begins with a review of important considerations that organizations should take into account when deploying public folder mailboxes. These considerations help ensure the public folder mailboxes are protected and readily available to your clients.

The module then examines how to create public folder mailboxes and public folders. To implement public folders in Exchange, you first must create a primary public folder mailbox. The public folder mailbox and each public folder can be created by using the Exchange admin center or Windows PowerShell.

With public folders in place, organizations must provide permissions to users to manage and maintain those folders. The module then examines how organizations configure public folder client permissions or access rights for users. These permissions are used to restrict the actions users can complete in the public folder.

The module concludes by exploring mail-enabled public folders. You'll learn that mail-enabling a public folder assigns an SMTP address to it and displays it in the GAL. Users can then post messages to the public folder by sending email messages to it.
