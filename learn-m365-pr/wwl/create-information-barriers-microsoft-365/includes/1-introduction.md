Microsoft 365 enables communication and collaboration across different teams within an organization. However, sometimes it's necessary to restrict these services so they don't create a conflict for the organization. These scenarios often include conflict of interest situations where the information shared could interfere with business ethics or business practices. Microsoft 365 addresses this situation by enabling organizations to create information barriers and ethical walls. These tools are the focus of this module.

This module examines how Information barriers and ethical walls enable administrators to restrict communication and collaboration between certain teams to safeguard the internal information. Information barriers are policies designed to prevent certain segments of users from communicating with each other, or allow specific segments to communicate only with certain other segments. Information barrier policies can help your organization maintain compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, and avoid potential conflicts of interest.

Suppose an administrator has been tasked to prohibit email communication between users in the Marketing and Finance departments. A transport rule, or ethical wall, can be created that prevents users in different departments from exchanging email using their corporate accounts. Similarly, suppose the administrator has been told to limit collaboration between the Day Trader team and Marketing team. The administrator can create an information barrier to prohibit file sharing and prevent communication between the two groups within Microsoft Teams.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how information barriers can restrict communication and collaboration among specific groups of users when necessary.
 -  Describe how information barrier policies help restrict or allow communication and collaboration.
 -  Identify the steps necessary to create an information barrier policy.
 -  Describe what an ethical wall in Exchange is and how it works.
 -  Explain how to create an ethical wall in Exchange.
 -  Identify best practices for building and working with ethical walls in Exchange.
