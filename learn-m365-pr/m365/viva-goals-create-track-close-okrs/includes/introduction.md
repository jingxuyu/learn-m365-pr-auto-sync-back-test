The **Objectives** and **Key Results** (OKRs) framework is a goal-setting framework that drives focus, visibility, and alignment. Viva Goals is the software that lets you create, maintain, and access OKRs across your organization.

You can easily create OKRs for any time period that is relevant for your organization and view how these Objectives and Key Results align.

OKRs can be updated and tracked on a regular basis manually by Viva Goals users by using an integrated collaboration platform or by using an integration with an outside data source.

Finally, you can close and score your OKRs for the current time period and capture any reflections that can be used when writing your next set of OKRs.

The four main actions that you'll perform in the system are known as the **4Cs**.

- **Cascade** - How OKRs align within Viva Goals
- **Create** - How to enter OKRs into the software
- **Check-in** - How to track the progress of your OKRs
- **Close** - How to score your OKRs
