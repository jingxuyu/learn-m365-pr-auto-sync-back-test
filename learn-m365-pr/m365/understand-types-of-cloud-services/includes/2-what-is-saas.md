Software as a service, or SaaS, is software thatâ€™s centrally hosted and managed by a cloud service provider for its customers. The software architecture typically uses one version of the application for all customers and is licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are examples of SaaS software.
