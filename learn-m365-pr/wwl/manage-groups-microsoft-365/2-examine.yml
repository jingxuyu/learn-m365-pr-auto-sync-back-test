quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, and you're planning to set up some groups in your Microsoft 365 tenant. You want to create a group that enables your Manufacturing team members to collaborate with one another. The group will provide them a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events. What type of group should you create?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Security groups are used to grant access permissions to resources such as OneDrive. They're not used for collaboration between team members, nor do they provide a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events. Try again."
    - content: "Distribution group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Distribution groups are used for sending email to all members of a group. However, they don't provide a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events. Try again."
    - content: "Microsoft 365 group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A Microsoft 365 group is similar to a distribution group in that it has its own mailbox and its members receive email messages that are sent to the group. However, it differs from distribution groups in that it allows teams to collaborate by providing them a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events."
