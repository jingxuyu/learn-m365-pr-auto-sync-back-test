In Contoso, you had a successful deployment of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps but you had identified some weak points in your defenses. For example, iOS devices were not protected, and there was no single location where you could observe security data from all the relevant products. By using advanced features of Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, you were able to close these loopholes and tighten security in your organization.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Create a custom indicator of compromise in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.
