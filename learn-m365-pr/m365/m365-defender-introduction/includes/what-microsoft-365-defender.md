Your security team currently uses multiple security products, which often work in isolation, with no data sharing and no data integration. This limits your team’s awareness about the context of the attack, which means it takes longer for your security team to put the pieces together. If you only view a threat within the boundaries of a single security product, you might miss additional aspects of an attack. And if you use different products, you’ll need to traverse different products, tools, and reports, slowing down your ability to respond to an attack. You might not discover the full scope of an attack until it’s too late.
