You can use different strategies to deploy an operating system on a new computer. The strategy that best fits your needs depend on various factors. These factors include the number of devices you must deploy to the operating system, deployment scenarios, user needs, and deployment tools available in your organization.
You can follow the guidelines below to identify the best strategy for your needs, including that you should:

 -  **Identify the deployment scenario or scenarios:** The scenario that you face determines the need for restoring user state data. Most organizations face two basic deployment scenarios:
    
     -  **New device:** You must install an operating system on a new device your organization hasn't used. In this scenario, if you deploy a device for a new user, there might be no user state data to migrate. This deployment can also include existing devices you treat as new, where you don't need to keep any of the device’s data.
     -  **Replacement device:** You use a new device as a replacement for an existing device. Therefore, transfer the current device’s user state data to the new device.
 -  **Identify the method or tools for deploying the OS and applications:** We should consider centralized management when an organization is managing over 25 devices. While this might seem like a low threshold, keep in mind that deployment isn’t just about delivering an operating system and apps and continuous management. It explicitly ensures that the device configuration doesn't drift to a state that becomes a security risk. Organizations should consider a management solution such as Microsoft Intune, whether they choose to manage devices themselves or contract with an IT management company.
 -  **Identify the necessary device drivers:** Different hardware requires different drivers. Ensure you identify and secure the essential drivers for each hardware device you use from a particular manufacturer. Do this for all applicable manufacturers.
 -  **Identify storage and network resources that you can use during deployment:** You must store images, installation files, device drivers, and user state data and then copy this data to the device that is undergoing deployment. Ensure that you identify available file servers and estimate the space you need for each item you must store and copy.
 -  **Identify operating system features and settings that each deployment requires:** You can automate most settings to apply during deployment. Most organizations enable BitLocker Drive Encryption on their Windows-based mobile devices. You can customize your deployment process to enable BitLocker after deployment.
 -  **Identify how you will handle licensing and activation:** Smaller organizations usually have an individual product key per user, while larger organizations might use Active Directory activation, Key Management Service (KMS), or multiple activation keys (MAKs).
 -  **Identify critical apps that you must maintain post-deployment:** You must ensure that apps are compatible with new operating systems or that you can mitigate any incompatibilities. You'll learn how to handle application compatibility issues in a later module.
 -  **Document your environment:** Collect all the relative information to help choose the appropriate strategy based on the company’s requirements.
