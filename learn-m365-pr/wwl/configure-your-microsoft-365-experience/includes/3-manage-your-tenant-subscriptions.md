Maintaining minimum subscription requirements for your company is essential to remaining functional. It is the Enterprise Administratorâ€™s responsibility to manage license counts. Purchasing an insufficient number of licenses can result in implementation delays, while purchasing an excessive number of licenses can result in overspending.

The following screenshot is an example from a tenant with group-based licensing, where all available licenses were already assigned. In this case, provisioning errors occurred due to depleted licenses.

The Enterprise Administrator (EA) can review all active and deprovisioned licenses from the Microsoft 365 admin center. In the left-hand navigation pane, the EA must select the **Billing** group and then the **Licenses** page. On the **Licenses** page, the EA should then select the **Subscriptions** tab.

The EA can also assign licenses from this page, remove licenses from user accounts, and purchase extra licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> Purchasing additional licenses changes the monthly billing date for those specific licenses. For example, if the main subscription was purchased on May 14<sup>th</sup> and there was an additional purchase that was completed on May 15<sup>th</sup>, then the next billing cycle would show subscriptions with due dates of June 15<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup>, respectively.

All the information regarding an organization's existing subscriptions, including billing and payment information, is available within the Billing group in the Microsoft 365 admin center. This group includes the following pages:

 *  **Purchase services**. This page enables you to do comparison shopping on up to three products at a time, and then initiate any purchases you wish to make.
 *  **Your products.** This page displays all the subscriptions purchased by your organization and enables you to perform maintenance on those plans.
 *  **Licenses.** This page provides a summary of the subscriptions purchased by your organization, including all the available licenses for each subscription.
 *  **Bills and payments.** This page provides a history of all invoices charged to your organization, along with payment methods and billing profiles.
 *  **Billing notifications.** This page identifies who will receive billing notifications within your organization and how each billing statement will be received.
 *  **Payment methods.** This page enables an organization to define payment methods that it can use to pay for subscriptions.
