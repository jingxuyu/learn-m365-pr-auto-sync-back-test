Your technical director wants to understand what roles are needed to make the stay current process a success. You’ve been asked to report back on which roles should be involved in the process and what they're responsible for.

## Who is involved in the stay current process?

To stay current, you’ll need to decide who does what, by assigning a number of different roles. Each role comes with responsibilities, and its typical associated skills. Individual roles are active during a particular phase of the process. The roles are as follows:

### Who should lead the stay current process?

It’s recommended that Woodgrove identify a Process Manager, who will oversee the tasks undertaken by everyone else. Each phase in the process has tasks that will be carried out by different roles across the various workstreams.

The Process Manager leads the process and has the authority to keep pushing it forward. The Process Manager is also informed of the outcome of the different work that's carried out. The list below shows some of the tasks that the Process Manager should be responsible for. The Process Manager engages teams to start the process, and is kept informed under the different workstreams:

The Process Manager also carries out tasks like:

- Collecting remediation outcome reports
- Escalating failures
- Determining whether the environment is ready for pilot deployment at the end of the prepare phase
- Broad implementation after the pilot deployment phase

If the Process Manager role can’t be assigned for some reason, for example because of resource constraints, then the role should be owned by your IT/end-user computing group.
