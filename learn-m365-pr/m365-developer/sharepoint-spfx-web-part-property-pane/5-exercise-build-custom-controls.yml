  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following best describes how a developer would use the `PropertyPaneCustomField` object?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The `PropertyPaneCustomField` is used as the base class for a reusable custom control that contains its own business logic."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `PropertyPaneCustomField` isn't a base class."
    - content: "The `PropertyPaneCustomField` is used when you want to map a custom web part property to a field control."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "All property pane field controls can map to any web part properties, including the custom properties."
  - content: "How are custom property pane field controls different from the `PropertyPaneCustomField` property pane field control?"
    choices:

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `PropertyPaneCustomField` isn't a base class."
    - content: "The `PropertyPaneCustomField` enables developers to define the rendering of a property pane field control. Custom property pane field controls enable developers to define not just the rendering of the control, but also make it reusable and include code that can pre-populate the control with external data."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Custom property pane field controls enable developers to define the rendering of a property pane field control.

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The opposite is true: the `PropertyPaneCustomField` enables developers to define the rendering of a property pane field control. Custom property pane field controls enable developers to define not just the rendering of the control, but also make it reusable and include code that can pre-populate the control with external data."
