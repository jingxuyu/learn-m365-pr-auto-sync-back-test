Creating and finding a wide range of content requires knowledge and expertise in different fields, subjects, and technologies available across your organization. It's unlikely that a Search admin, or even an IT admin team, will have all the information and details to create authoritative content for the large variety of topics needed.

To provide the breadth, depth, and quality of answer content that users will likely expect, Search admins should partner with people across their organization. We suggest bringing together a team of key stakeholders to help define and provide the answer content needed and evangelize adoption of Microsoft Search within their teams or groups.

The table below outlines some of the key people who can help you in the planning and rollout phase:

   | Stakeholder                 | Role |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | **Executive sponsor**                                        | Communicates high-level vision, including how Microsoft Search supports the core mission and priorities of the organization. Provides leadership to the stakeholder team and helps allocate resources. |
   | **Change management experts**                                               | Determines the process, reviews, and sign offs that may be required to deploy Microsoft Search. Supports internal campaigns and communications to increase awareness and drive adoption of Microsoft Search.  |
   | **Subject matter experts (SMEs)** | Contributes to answer content specific to their teams or functional areas, such as HR, sales, legal, privacy, product or business teams, support, and other key areas. Search admins might consider adding them as Search editors or they can compile content that can be imported. SMEs can also help test search functionality to ensure answers are being correctly triggered and evaluate the overall quality of the search results. |
   | **Champions and/or users**                                         | Suggests and helps prioritize answer content and sources, provides peer-to-peer assistance and expertise. They can give unique insight into how people use search within your organization.
