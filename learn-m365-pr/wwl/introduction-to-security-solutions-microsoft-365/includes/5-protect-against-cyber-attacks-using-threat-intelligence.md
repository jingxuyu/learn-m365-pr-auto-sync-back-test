### Scenario: Using Microsoft 365 Threat explorer to investigate a malware threat.<br>

Suppose you want to investigate a malware threat. Here are some examples of how you can use Threat explorer:

 -  Drill down into the history of a threat. You can filter on options like sender email, recipient email, sender IP address, and the detection technology used to stop a threat. For example, you can determine whether an email was blocked by Microsoft Defender for Office 365 or through an Exchange Online Protection filter.
 -  Get information about:
    
     -  malware family behavior
     -  a definition of the threat
     -  technical details (with a link to an associated analyst report)
     -  global details (to see how a threat has affected the global Microsoft 365 network, specific nations and industries, and your own organization)
     -  advanced analysis (with more details on how the threat is affecting your organization)
 -  See each instance where a user in an organization got an attachment with a specific malware threat.
 -  See if an email was caught and blocked before it reached the user, or if it was delivered as spam.
