MyAnalytics uses data from your Office 365 mailbox; specifically, data about emails, meetings, and chats and calls in Teams and in Skype for Business. MyAnalytics does not use an agent or tracking software on your device to capture this data. MyAnalytics also does not use data derived from activities on your computer, such as applications that you’ve used and websites that you’ve visited.

- **Outlook add-in**: The Outlook add-in presents you with interactive insight cards that report on aspects of your recent work experience. 
- **Email digests**: You receive a weekly digest in email that gives you highlights about your previous week.
- **MyAnalytics nudges**: MyAnalytics nudges are notifications that appear in Microsoft Outlook that can help boost your productivity by displaying useful suggestions and tips around emails, meetings, and to-do tasks.
