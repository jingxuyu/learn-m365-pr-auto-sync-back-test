Now that you understand what DLP is and how you can use it in Teams, let's create a new DLP policy to protect sensitive information in Teams chat and channels. By creating DLP policies, admins can help prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being shared or leakedâ€”either inside or outside of the organization.

> [!NOTE]
> When creating a policy for use with Teams, you must include other technologies that Teams uses; Exchange email, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive accounts as you will see in this section.

Account information: For all of the walkthroughs in this learning path, you will need to open a browser and connect to <https://compliance.microsoft.com>. Sign in to the Compliance Center using your own admin account. You will need proper licensing to access the Compliance Center.

## Customize the policy

In this part, you will customize the DLP policy by excluding this policy from everyone in the Leadership team. By excluding members of the Leadership team from this policy, you are free to create a policy just for those users that can be tailored for their needs. For example, you could create a policy with different tip information that they can take action upon.
