In March of 2019, a large auto manufacturer with state-of-the-art, proprietary operations and technology filed a lawsuit against four former employees and a competitor for corporate espionage. The lawsuit was filed after discovering that the employees had downloaded proprietary warehouse schematics and operational procedures before leaving the company and shared them with the competitor.

Trusting employees is key to fostering a dynamic and productive workplace. But with trust also comes risk. Companies need to be able to quickly identify and manage risk from insiders (employees or contractors with corporate access) to minimize the negative impact to their business. Insider threats and risks from illegal, inappropriate, unauthorized, or unethical behavior and actions are a major issue for all companies and can easily go undetected until it is too late. A survey by Crowd Research Partners in 2018 indicated that 90% of organizations feel vulnerable to insider risks and 53% confirmed insider risks against their organization in the previous 12 months. According to a Carnegie Mellon CERT study, 92% of insider threat cases were preceded by a negative work event, such as a termination, demotion, or dispute with a supervisor. And in 2016, Deloitte reported that 59% of employees who leave an organization voluntarily or involuntarily say they take sensitive data with them and that 51% of employees involved in an insider threat incident had a history of violating IT security policies leading up to the incident. 

reputational and productivity losses. According to the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of an insider incident arising from negligence is over $307,000. If the insider is malicious, it’s over $750,000. Aside from financial loss, the impacts of insider risk can include damage to brand and reputation, competitive disadvantage, noncompliance with regulations, and loss of market share.

Traditional approaches to identifying insider risks such as user behavior analytics, monitoring user activity, and data loss prevention can suffer from limitations such as complex deployment scenarios, limited insights, and a lack of workload integration beyond SecOps. 

The insider risk management solution in Microsoft 365 leverages the Microsoft Graph, security services and connectors to human resources (HR) systems like SAP, to obtain real-time native signals such as file activity, communications sentiment, abnormal user behaviors and resignation date. A set of configurable policy templates tailored specifically for risks – such as digital IP theft, confidentiality breach, and HR violations – use machine learning and intelligence to correlate these signals to identify hidden patterns and risks that traditional or manual methods might miss. These built in policy templates allow you to identify and mitigate risky activities while balancing employee privacy versus organization risk with privacy-by-design architecture. Finally, end-to-end integrated workflows ensure that the right people across security, HR, legal and compliance are involved to quickly investigate and take action once a risk has been identified.
