The Search admin from our pharmaceuticals company has taken several actions to address the oversharing concerns from the leadership team. The Search admin has worked with the Compliance and Security admins to implement three solutions to manage access:

- Disable recent files from appearing on profiles for executives or people in legal or HR security groups.
- Create information barriers between marketing and development teams.
- Limit who can create public groups and sites.
