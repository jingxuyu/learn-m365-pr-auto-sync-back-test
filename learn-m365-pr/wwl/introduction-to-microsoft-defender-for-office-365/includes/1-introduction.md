Exchange Online Protection (EOP) uses a multi-layered approach to protect users from various threats, including:

 -  phishing
 -  spoofing
 -  spam
 -  bulk email
 -  malware

Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (formerly Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)) extends the protection provided by EOP by filtering targeted attacks that could pass through EOPâ€™s line of defenses. These attacks include:

 -  advanced threats such as zero-day attacks in email attachments and Office documents.
 -  time-of-selection protection against malicious URLs.

When integrated together, EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 represent the anti-malware pipeline in Microsoft 365. These products provide the most efficient level of protection against commodity and advanced targeted threats.
