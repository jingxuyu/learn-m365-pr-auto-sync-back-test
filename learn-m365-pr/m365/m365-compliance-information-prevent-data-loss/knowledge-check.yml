    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "A user sends an email to several recipients containing 16 unique credit card numbers that match a single DLP Policy rule with this sensitive information type. How many lines will display on the DLP Policy matches report? "
      choices:
      - content: "1"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The DLP policy matches report shows matches at a rule level. If an email matched three different rules, the DLP policy matches report would show three different line items. By contrast, the DLP incidents report shows matches at an item level. If an email matched three different rules, the incidents report shows a single line-item for that item. "
      - content: "3"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. The DLP policy matches report shows matches at a rule level. If an email matched three different rules, the DLP policy matches report would show three different line items. By contrast, the DLP incidents report shows matches at an item level. If an email matched three different rules, the incidents report shows a single line-item for that item."
      - content: "16"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. The DLP policy matches report shows matches at a rule level. If an email matched three different rules, the DLP policy matches report would show three different line items. By contrast, the DLP incidents report shows matches at an item level. If an email matched three different rules, the incidents report shows a single line-item for that item."
      
    - content: "Too many DLP policy false positives can have a negative effect on business production. Additionally, too many false positives can result in security teams ignoring the warnings. Microsoft sensitive information types are thoroughly tested. There is still a chance your organization may have specific needs not met by built-in sensitive information types. What do you do if your DLP incident report returns too many false positives? "
      choices:
      - content: "Modify the DLP policy."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. When identifying information to protect, you need to configure the conditions that will result in a policy being triggered via rules. Data loss prevention includes policy templates that include rules for detecting many common sensitive information types. You can modify these rules using the rule editor if they are resulting in too many false positives."
      - content: "Create a new retention policy and attach it to the DLP policy."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. Retention policies are used to decide proactively whether to retain content, delete content, or both. They have nothing to do with data loss prevention."
      - content: "Design a new DLP policy."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While you certainly can design a new policy, modifying the existing policy is the best practice."
        
    - content: "Maintaining patient privacy is a top priority in the Health Care industry. As a senior care facility, what best practice should you employ using the ready-to-use U.S personal information policy template? "
      choices:
      - content: "Create a custom policy to identify HIPAA-protected information. "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. Microsoft data loss prevention policy templates are thoroughly tested. Create a custom policy only if none of the built-in policies meet your requirements."
      - content: "Turn on the policy right away."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. It's always a good practice to test the DLP policy first to validate functionality and alignment with your specific organizational needs."
      - content: "Test the policy before releasing it."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. In most cases, you will want to test the DLP policy to make sure it is functioning as expected and meets your specific organizationâ€™s needs. "

    - content: "You have already deployed data loss prevention and are using it to protect data in Microsoft Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. You also want to protect data stored on your Windows devices, so you have modified an existing policy and added Devices to the list of locations you will protect. What else must you do to begin protecting content on your Windows devices?"
      choices:
      - content: "Make sure each device is Azure AD registered."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. Each device that will be protected must be Azure AD joined or Hybrid Azure AD joined. Azure AD registered devices are not supported."
      - content: "Onboard each device."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Device onboarding enables collecting data from devices to incorporate into Endpoint DLP. Only devices that have been onboarded can be included in DLP policies that target Windows devices."
      - content: "Once created, you can't add locations to a DLP policy, so this isn't a valid scenario."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sorry, this is incorrect. Locations can be added or removed from DLP policies."
