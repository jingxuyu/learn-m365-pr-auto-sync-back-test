Microsoft Teams provides your users with a powerful cloud-based collaboration experience. Moving to the cloud increases flexibility for employees and IT but also introduces security challenges and complexities. Microsoft provides powerful tools that can help identify and protect your cloud-based services using Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Cloud App Security, and Conditional Access.

This module covers what you need to consider as a Microsoft Teams security admin. After you've deployed Teams across your organization, you must be sure that security is optimal for your requirements, and that you protect Teams users from potential threats.

Suppose you're an administrator for Contoso and you're in charge of a new Teams deployment with around 3000 users. The board of directors has been concerned about an increase in denial-of-service attacks and data regulation breaches that have been making headlines recently. They've made you responsible for security enforcement and you want to ensure you have access to the best tools to maximize your defenses.

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with general Microsoft Teams administration.

## Learning objectives

After you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) features within Teams.
- Describe how security is implemented for cloud applications.
- Explain how to restrict and control access to Teams resources using Conditional Access.
