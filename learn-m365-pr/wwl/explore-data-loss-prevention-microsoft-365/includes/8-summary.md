This module introduced you to Data loss prevention (DLP). DLP is a security feature that protects sensitive data in email, SharePoint content, and Office files from being accidentally or intentionally shared with unauthorized users. For instance, DLP can prevent someone from sharing personal information or intellectual property, or stop someone from accidentally emailing a file attachment to an unauthorized recipient.

This module examined the fundamentals of data loss prevention in Exchange and SharePoint. Data loss prevention is configured through DLP policies. Policies consist of conditions and actions that are centered around identifying sensitive information data. In this module, you learned how conditions and actions work together to support data loss prevention in Microsoft 365.

This module also introduced you to Endpoint data loss prevention. Endpoint DLP extends the activity monitoring and protection capabilities of DLP to sensitive items that are physically stored on Windows 10, Windows 11, and macOS devices.

This module also introduced you to three key reporting tools that organizations can use to view DLP policy violations and triage actions taken on sensitive information:

 -  DLP Alerts dashboard
 -  DLP reports
 -  DLP Activity explorer
