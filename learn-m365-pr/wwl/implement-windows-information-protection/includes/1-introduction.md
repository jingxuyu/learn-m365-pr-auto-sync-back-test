Once you've protected your Microsoft 365 and Azure services, you must still secure your client devices against a possible data leakage. For example, employees can put their company’s sensitive data at risk when they:

 -  send the latest engineering pictures from their personal email account to an external person.
 -  copies and pastes product information into a tweet.
 -  save an in-progress sales report to their public cloud storage.

With the increase of employee-owned devices in the enterprise, there’s also an increasing risk of accidental data leakage. Data leakage often occurs through apps and services, such as email, social media, and the public cloud, all of which are outside the enterprise’s control.<br>

This module examines how Windows Information Protection (WIP) helps to protect against this potential data leakage without otherwise interfering with the employee experience. WIP also helps to protect enterprise apps and data against accidental data leak on enterprise-owned devices and personal devices that employees bring to work without requiring changes to your environment or other apps.

In this module, you'll learn how Windows Information Protection (WIP) can protect your clients to prevent the loss of work-related company data. You'll learn how to plan for WIP policies and how to implement those policies in Windows desktop apps.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe Windows Information Protection and what it's used for.
 -  Plan a deployment of Windows Information Protection policies.
 -  Implement Windows Information Protection policies in Windows desktop apps.
