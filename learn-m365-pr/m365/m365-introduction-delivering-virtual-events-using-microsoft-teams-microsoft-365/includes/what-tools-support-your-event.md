Unlike in-person events, virtual events require you to make different choices about how to deliver your content and what tools to use. 

After planning and designing your new virtual summit, you've come to realize that Microsoft 365 supports you with two distinct options. You can run small events up to 1,000 people with a normal Microsoft Teams meeting. Using all it's tools for video and screen sharing, and interactivity between meeting attendees. When your audience is larger, up to 100,000 people, Microsoft supports you with Live Events.

Here you'll see how to make the decision on which approach to is best to take. 

## Microsoft Teams meetings vs. Live Events

The best tool to use for your event depends on the experience you want for your attendees.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/teams-event-experience.png" alt-text="Table showing experience that is best supported by Microsoft Teams.":::

The table has four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

Under the columns are three rows. In each row there are cells highlighted in blue, which show the kind of experience best supported by Microsoft Teams. These cells are Single event, Event series, Part of an engagement community, Open two-way discussion, up to 1,000, and simple webcam and screen share.

    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        For your virtual events that are up to 1,000 people and only need the presenters to use their own webcams and screen sharing, Microsoft recommends Microsoft Teams meetings. Microsoft Teams supports:

        - Open discussions via audio and video for attendees
        - Interactive chat & multiple presenters
        - Supports the use of Microsoft Yammer as part of a community experience or series of continuing conversations

:::row-end:::

:::image type="complex" source="../media/live-event-experience.png" alt-text="Table showing experience that is best supported by Live Events.":::
This is the same table with four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

There are then three rows under it. There are cells highlighted in blue which show the kind of experience best supported by Live Events. These cells are Single event, Event series, shaded Part of an engagement community, Managed Q & A, No attendee discussion or Q&A, Up to 20,000 and 100,000 people, multiple presenters, and Custom production.

    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="3":::
        For your virtual events that are up to 100,000 people and you need more custom video production, Microsoft recommends Live Events. Live Events support:

        - Broad scale and highly managed content
        - Maximum flexibility and choice of tools
        - Form part of a larger engagement community

> \* There is currently an increased limit to 20,000 this will reduce back down to the normal supported limit of 10,000 after December 31, 2021.<br/>
> \** Stream live events are normally only allowed inside your organization. You can make them available outside if you arrange support for your event from the Live Events Assisstance Program (LEAP) team. 

## Which Live Event experience should you use

If you've decided that a Live Event is the right choice to deliver your virtual event, you still have a choice on the tools you can use.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/live-events-decision-matrix.png" alt-text="A decision matrix that guides the reader through choosing Teams, Yammer, or Stream for your Live Event.":::
This diagram has two paths, if you'll have up to 20,000 people - 10,000 after December 31st 2021 - or you've up to 100,000. For the 20,000 path, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 and no attendee discussion and custom video production then Live Events with Stream is the better option.

Using the above decision matrix you can see that for events with up to 20,000 people watching, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 with no attendee discussion and custom video production, then Live Events with Stream is the best option. Remember that Streams can only be used outside your organization with the support of your event from the LEAP team.
