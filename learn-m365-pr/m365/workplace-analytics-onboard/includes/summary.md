Using this training, in our hypothetical scenario you were able to identify the right people in Contoso to include in the analysis population. You then worked with Alex (your Office 365 administrator) to assign the licenses and roles across the company. Taylor (your Workplace Analytics administrator) configured Workplace Analytics, based on Contoso's privacy requirements, and uploaded the organizational data that your analysts need to begin their analysis.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:

- Understand how different parts of your company come together to set up Workplace Analytics  
- Discover how to identify and then assign licenses to the right population
- Configure Workplace Analytics settings and privacy controls to match your organization's specific needs
- Prepare and upload organizational data that enables your Workplace Analytics analysts to succeed
