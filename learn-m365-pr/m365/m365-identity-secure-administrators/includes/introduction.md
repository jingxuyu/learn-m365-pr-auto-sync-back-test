Privileged accounts administer and manage critical resources. Cyberattackers often target these accounts to gain unauthorized access to an organizationâ€™s sensitive data and configuration settings. To protect privileged accounts, you should take precautions to reduce their exposure to malicious actors.

Traditional security methods focused on the organization's network as the primary security perimeter. These methods are now less effective because administrators frequently work with many SaaS apps and personal devices. In a modern organization, identity is the new security plane.

Administrator accounts typically control this new security perimeter. It's therefore essential to secure privileged access, whether your environment is on-premises, cloud, or hybrid.

To protect administrator accounts from sophisticated attacks, you must reduce their risk profile. This module describes services in Microsoft 365 that you can use to limit the security risk of privileged accounts.
