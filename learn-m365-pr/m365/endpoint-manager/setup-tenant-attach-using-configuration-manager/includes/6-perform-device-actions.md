You need to ensure every device you manage is reachable, no matter where it is or when it connects. You also need to provide each user with everything they need to stay productive, while protecting devices, apps, and data. With the device actions supported by Intune, you can remotely solve these critical functions.

## Benefits of remote device actions

Remote device actions give you management control of devices without interfering with personal data on those devices. These remote device actions allow you to: 
- Delete company data on lost or stolen devices  
- Rename a device  
- Restart a device  
- Review device inventory  
- Remotely control a device  
- Wipe out pre-installed OEM apps with a Fresh Start reboot  
- Do a factory reset on any Windows 10 device  

These functions are an important and simple way to protect corporate data stored on these devices, whether in e-mail or OneDrive.

## Perform remote device actions

You can use the following steps to use remote device actions:

1. In a browser, navigate [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **All devices** to see the uploaded devices. You'll see **ConfigMgr** in the **Managed by** column for uploaded devices.

When you run an action from Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, the notification request is forwarded to Configuration Manager site, and from the site to the client. These remote actions help you manage your organization's endpoints, whether they're on premises or in the cloud, using a single, modern, integrated management platform.
