Microsoft Teams is built on the Microsoft 365 cloud and delivers advanced security and compliance capabilities. Teams enforces team- and organization-wide two-factor authentication, single sign-on through Active Directory, and encryption of data in transit and at rest.

Files and wiki data are stored in SharePoint, backed by SharePoint encryption. Notes are stored in OneNote in the team SharePoint site, further protected with OneNote encryption.

## Safeguarding your privacy

Microsoft is committed to ensuring the privacy of organization through our contractual agreements and by providing user control and transparency. The following are Microsoft's commitment to privacy:

- *Controlled by you* - We commit to strong privacy protections through greater user control and transparency.
- *No data profiling* - We won't share or use your data for marketing, advertising, or other commercial purposes.
- *Strong legal protection* - We don't provide governments with "back doors", encryption keys, or assistance to break encryption.
- *GDPR for all customers* - We extend General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data protection rights to all customers worldwide, not just Europe.
- *Listening to customers* - We actively collaborate with customers and regulators to foresee and shape compliance regulations.

To the extent Microsoft processes personal data with its own legitimate business operations, as described in the Online Services Terms, Microsoft is an independent controller for such processing.

### Third-party access to data

Microsoft will not disclose personal data except:

- As the customer directs (including as required to complete phone calls).
- As described in the Online Service Terms (such as the use of authorized subcontractors to provide certain components of services).
- As required by law.

## Security framework

Core elements of the Teams security framework are:

- Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which provides a single trusted back-end repository for user accounts.
- Transport Layer Security (TLS), and mutual TLS (MTLS) which encrypt instant message traffic and enable endpoint authentication.
- Industry-standard protocols for user authentication, provided by Azure AD in Microsoft 365.

### Security by design

Teams is designed and developed in compliance with the Microsoft Trustworthy Computing Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). No system can guarantee complete security. However, because product development embraced secure design principles from the start, Teams incorporates industry standard security technologies as a fundamental part of its architecture.
