You work for an enterprise-level organization. Users in your organization collaborate and communicate by using Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams. Users rely on the collaboration and communication features in Microsoft Teams, and it is now a critical service within your organization. As a Teams administrator you need to be able to configure Microsoft Teams and troubleshoot any problems. 

Since moving to Microsoft 365, your users have been increasingly relaying on Teams for collaboration and communications. It’s important to troubleshoot problems relating to member sign-in, account authentication, and network access issues. In addition, because Teams is used to collaborate with external users, you must be able to configure and troubleshoot guest access.
