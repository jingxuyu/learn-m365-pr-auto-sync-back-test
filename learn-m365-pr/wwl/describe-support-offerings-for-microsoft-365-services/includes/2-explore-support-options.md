Administrators and users in your organization might find it difficult to resolve issues on their own. It’s helpful to know that users and administrators in your organization can receive assistance whenever they need it.

## Support options

When your organization uses Microsoft 365 services, it can take advantage of different support options to resolve issues. The support option chosen to deal with a particular issue depends on:

- The tool or service where the issue has arisen.
- The type of subscription your organization uses.
- The kind of support your organization needs.

Your organization can get access to support in the following ways:

| **Support  type**                       | **Description**                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Community-based support**            | Your organization can take advantage of  community-based support through the [Microsoft   365 Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365/ct-p/microsoft365), where you can collaborate with others,  and solve problems. Your organization can also use the [Microsoft 365 support forms](https://answers.microsoft.com) to ask  questions and solve issues with members from Microsoft and the community. |
| **Microsoft 365 Support Assistant**     | Your organization can use the Support Assistant bot in the Microsoft  365 admin center to quickly find answers to support related questions. |
| **Web, email, and telephone support**   | Your organization can submit issues to Microsoft  support to receive around the clock technical, billing, and accounts support  via email, online chat, or telephone support. |
| **FastTrack**                           | Here, your organization is connected with dedicated Microsoft  engineers, project managers, and resources to help deploy Microsoft 365  services and resolve issues along the way |
| **Premier Support for Microsoft 365**   | Microsoft offers Premier Support Services that your  organization can take advantage of to receive on-site support, a dedicated  technical account manager, and access to advisory services. |
| **Support through a Microsoft Partner** | Your organization can get support directly through a certified  Microsoft 365 Partner. For example, if  your organization has purchased a Microsoft 365 subscription through a Tier 1  Cloud Services Provider, it will receive direct support from the CSP. The CSP  will act as the first line support for all issues and will escalate issues to  Microsoft if they are unable to resolve them. |
