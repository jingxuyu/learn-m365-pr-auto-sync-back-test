Endpoint Analytics gives Administrators insights into the overall quality of the desktop experience. A baseline is established, and a score is assigned to each device based on the aggregate experience. The score makes it easy for Administrators to quickly and proactively identify devices with the most significant issues, and drill down into the details that are creating a negative effect. These factors include metrics such as boot time, sign-in experience, frequent restarts, abnormal shutdowns, and app performance. Endpoint Analytics also provides hardware readiness to assess which devices don't meet the requirement for upgrading to Windows 11.
