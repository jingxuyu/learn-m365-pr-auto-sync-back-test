    choices:
    - content: "Gallery control"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The Gallery control is used to display records from a table of data. The display of a record is then defined by a template, which can be customized. This design enables the app creator to control which fields are displayed and how they're formatted."
    - content: "Forms control"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Forms are designed to work with a specific record. Display forms enable the app user to view detailed information for an existing record."
    - content: "Input controls"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Text inputs, buttons, dropdowns, toggles, date pickers, and sliders are a few examples of the various input controls that are available. App creators can add these controls to galleries, forms, and screens to build a functional and aesthetic experience for the app."
  - content: "As Lucerne Publishing's Enterprise Administrator, Holly Spencer is interested in building an app for a Test Drive solution. Holly has discovered that this process is similar to building an app in Power Apps, with one exception. What is that exception?"

    - content: "The app-maker must use imported Excel data in table format"
