Microsoft 365 provides many ways to manage your user and group synchronization, all of which can be managed using an application called Azure Active Directory (AD) Connect. This application is a free feature provided by Microsoft to integrate your companyâ€™s Active Directory and import your local users to the cloud.

### Why use Azure AD Connect?

Integrating your on-premises directories with Azure AD provides a common identity for accessing both cloud and on-premises resources. The following diagram depicts how Azure AD Connect creates a copy of an organization's on-premises AD users in Azure AD. When users access their on-premises resources, access is accomplished using their on-premises identities. Conversely, when users access Microsoft 365 services such as Exchange Online and SharePoint Online, they use their connected Azure AD user accounts.

Users and organizations can take advantage of the following Azure AD Connect features:

 *  Users can use a single identity to access on-premises applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365.
 *  It provides an easy deployment experience for synchronization and a single tool for signing in.
 *  It provides the newest capabilities for your implementation scenarios by replacing older versions of identity integration tools such as DirSync and Azure AD Sync.

### How Azure AD Connect works

Azure Active Directory Connect is made up of two primary components:

 *  **Synchronization services.** This component is responsible for synchronizing users, groups, and other objects. It is also responsible for making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups is matching the cloud.
 *  **Azure AD Connect Health.** Azure AD Connect Health provides robust health monitoring and a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Connect Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/connect-health/active-directory-aadconnect-health?azure-portal=true).
