Microsoft 365 lets you deliver engaging and inclusive virtual events to teams of all sizes.

As part of your organization's virtual summit planning team, you've been tasked with both organizing and moderating several sessions.

Before looking at what you are presenting, you will bring together a team and work out how to change your physical event into an engaging virtual event. With your team in place you can then ensure the content your team delivers is accessible and inclusive.

When the summit has finished, you'll want to review its success and put improvements in place for the future and follow up to keep the momentum you gained from your event going.

This module has content for organizers, producers, presenters, and moderators.
