Exchange Online includes industry-leading tools to ensure compliance with item retention legislation in your jurisdiction. You must configure these tools correctly to ensure that items can be found and held in the event of legal action.

Suppose you work for a newspaper that is often taken to court by those who disagree with its coverage. Emails sent to and received from Exchange Online are often needed as evidence to support your defense in these cases, but sometimes relevant emails haven't been found during eDiscovery searches. You want to troubleshoot these issues to ensure that all relevant emails are retained and available to your legal representatives.

In this module, you'll learn how to investigate and resolve any misconfiguration in Exchange Online's compliance and retention tools.

## Learning objectives
