Searching through documents in multiple locations wastes time and can lead to unnecessary duplication. Microsoft SharePoint Syntex gives administrators the power to automate document classification and extract meaningful information about the contents through document understanding and form processing models. The decision to add SharePoint Syntex to an organization's existing SharePoint library helps users extract data to enhance business processes.

You and your team at Contoso Electronics realized that your document libraries aren't as well organized as they could be. SharePoint Syntex was identified as the best solution to this problem. You worked out a strategy to bring SharePoint Syntex into the company. Armed with approval from key stakeholders and a project plan, you are now ready to get started. Before you can apply the power of AI to your libraries, however, you need to set up and configure SharePoint Syntex for your environment.  

In this module, you will learn how to adopt SharePoint Syntex; how to identify which prerequisites your organization meets, and which need to be met; how to identify proper licensing that corresponds to the size of the organization and the number and types of users; which steps to take to enable SharePoint Syntex; and how to configure SharePoint Syntex. Once completed with this module, you will be able to identify the libraries you want to organize and will be able to set up SharePoint Syntex.
