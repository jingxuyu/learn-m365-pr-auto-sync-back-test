  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys. When a member of the Sales team recently left the company, you removed the Office 365 E3 license from the user's Microsoft 365 account. What will happen to any service data associated with that user?"
    choices:
    - content: "Any service data associated with that user is soft-deleted, but you have a 30-day grace period in which you can recover the data before it gets permanently deleted"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When you remove the license from one of your users, any service data that is associated with that user is soft-deleted. You then have a 30-day grace period in which you can recover that data, but after the grace period, the data is not recoverable."
    - content: "Any service data associated with that user is soft-deleted, but you can recover the data anytime after the data is deleted"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't what happens to a user's service data when you remove a license from the user's account. Try again."
    - content: "Any service data associated with that user is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This isn't what happens to a user's service data when you remove a license from the user's account. Try again."
