You learned about the Teams out-of-box-experience in this module. Then you were given some key actions to consider, such as changing the Admin password, updating the Teams Rooms app, and updating Windows. You learned how to change the settings inside Teams Rooms and how to validate your Teams Rooms configuration to make sure it's working correctly.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the out-of-box experience.
- Configure Teams Rooms after the out-of-box experience is completed.
- Test that everything is installed and configured correctly.
