  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "Suppose you have a system that contains sales contacts, and your sales team regularly needs to search for contacts, share them with the team, and have a conversation about them. What Microsoft Teams extensibility point would be most suited to help this process?"
    choices:
    - content: "A conversational bot in a channel."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The conversation with the bot wouldn't be relevant to the entire channel, only the result of the conversation."
    - content: "A messaging extension with a search command."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This is a good scenario for a messaging extension with a search command."
    - content: "A personal app with a tab."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A personal app wouldn't provide a good way to share the results of the search, or have a conversation around them."
  - content: "Which of the following is NOT part of your Microsoft Teams app package?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your app icons."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is part of your app package."
    - content: "HTML formatted app description."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Metadata for your app is included in your app manifest, in JSON format."
    - content: "Your app manifest file."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is part of your app package. It contains the metadata for your app, the extensibility points your app uses, and pointers to your web services."
  - content: "If your app is for a particular company, which distribution model should you choose?"
    choices:
    - content: "Publish your app to the public app store."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "You should only submit your app for publication to the public app store if you believe it's relevant for all Teams users everywhere."
    - content: "Distribute your app package for users to install directly."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Although technically possible, this would be a inefficient method of distribution for an entire organization."
    - content: "Publish to the organizational app catalog."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Apps in an organization app catalog can be installed by any user in that company with the correct permissions."
