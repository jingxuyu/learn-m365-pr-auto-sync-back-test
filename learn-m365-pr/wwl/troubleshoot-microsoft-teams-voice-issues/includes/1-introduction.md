You work for a large organization where employees rely on audio and video features to hold meetings in Microsoft Teams. This has become a critical service for your organization. 

Good quality audio and video allow users to focus on their work, and not the software. Poor audio or video causes issues such as calls dropping, sound breaking up, or video freezing. This leads to frustration and can discourage people from using Microsoft Teams. Audio and video quality is affected by the way that users work with Microsoft Teams. IT activities such as network configuration can also impact audio and video.

In this module, we'll look at how to monitor and troubleshoot audio and video quality issues. We'll also examine emergency calls and direct routing issues.
