### Understanding the Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus deployment process

Before you get started migrating to Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus, you’ll want to create a high-level plan and get the necessary organization sponsors on board. The deployment process throughout this learning path outlines critical steps to help you identify core team members and resources.

**Step 1: Device and app readiness.** For a successful deployment you must first take an inventory of your devices and apps and verify compatibility, leveraging the Microsoft tools available.

**Step 2: Directory and network readiness.** You’ll need to implement Azure Active Directory for identity and access management while also preparing your network for the movement of system images, application packages, user files, and updates across it.
 
**Step 3: Office and line of business app delivery.** Office 365 ProPlus and Office 2019 clients use Click-to-Run installation technology, and you may also  want to make a range of UWP or MSIX-based line of business apps available.  Plan for Office and app delivery whether your apps deploy using Click-to-Run, MSIX, conventional MSI, or are UWP apps deployed from a Microsoft Store.

**Step 4: User files and settings migration.** Ensuring users’ files, data, and settings move successfully and are preserved over the migration is critical in any PC replacement or refresh project. You have the option of using  traditional methods like the User State Migration Tool and the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or modern options like a OneDrive Known Folder Move.

**Step 5: Security and compliance.** Whether it’s leveraging the built-in capabilities of Windows 10 using virtualization-based security or cloud services like Advanced Threat Protection, securing and protecting endpoints, identity, and data is critical.

**Step 6: OS Deployment and feature updates.** Tools like System Center Configuration Manager can help automate and control OS deployment and subsequent feature updates. Microsoft recommends phased deployments, first targeting and deploying to an “early adopter group” in your organization with a representative set of hardware and apps. You can then use the data from those devices and users to target more PCs to scale your deployment.

**Step 7: Windows and Office as a service.** With the move to Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus you can move to managing Windows and Office as a service, bringing new capabilities, experiences, and protections to your end users. Semi-annual feature updates deliver new capabilities in the fall and spring of each year, while monthly cumulative Quality Updates contain security, reliability, and bug fixes. 

**Step 8: User communications and training.** Rolling out user communications and training is critical to driving desired changes in how people use new capabilities in Office, Windows, or other line of business apps and services.
