### Microsoft’s responsibility

Microsoft is available during onboarding to provide remote assistance in planning the development and implementation of Microsoft 365.

 -  During the Initiation phase, Microsoft works with the organization to understand its organization’s goals, define the services it plans to onboard, and begin the onboarding process.
 -  During the Assessment phase, Microsoft provides an overview and guidance on internal services such as DNS, network, and infrastructure needs. They also provide a remediation checklist and establish a timeline for remediation activities.
 -  During the Remediation phase, Microsoft is available by phone to review the progress of remediation and assist with running tools to identify and remediate issues during the process.
 -  During the Enable phase, Microsoft evaluates the process, activates the tenant, and helps configure and validate the Microsoft 365 environment.

### The customer's responsibility

Even with the FastTrack service, an organization still has some responsibility for various aspects of the project, including information gathering. The following list identifies the customer's minimum responsibilities:

 -  During the Initiation phase, the organization is responsible for defining its goals.
 -  During the Assessment phase, the organization is responsible for creating a support plan for migration and outlining successful scenarios.
 -  During the Remediation phase, the organization is responsible for completing the activities that are identified in the Assessment phase. Attending checkpoint meetings with Microsoft and its internal project team is also required.
