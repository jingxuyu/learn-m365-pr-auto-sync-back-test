There are four steps to successfully onboard Workplace Analytics: 

1. Assign licenses.
2. Assign user roles.
3. Make privacy and configuration settings.
4. Prepare and upload organizational data.

Before you learn about these steps in detail, it's important to understand the roles various individuals play during onboarding.

Companies that are onboarding Workplace Analytics will typically set up a working group with an executive sponsor, a project leader, a proposed Workplace Analytics admin, analysts (often from HR/IT people analytics), and the Microsoft 365 administrator.

This group will:
- Determine which employees are assigned Workplace Analytics licenses.
- Determine which team members are assigned roles in Workplace Analytics, which give them access to the system.
- Provide input to the Workplace Analytics admin on appropriate privacy and configuration settings.
- Identify necessary data fields to include in the org data file, based on the scope of analyses.

The Microsoft 365 administrator assigns licenses and user roles (steps 1 and 2). The Workplace Analytics administrator confirms Workplace Analytics settings and uploads the organizational data file (steps 3 and 4).
