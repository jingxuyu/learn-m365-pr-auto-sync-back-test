In your role as a security analyst, you were tasked with exploring the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender and how each of the other Microsoft Defender products integrates and shares its data.

By integrating Microsoft 365 Defender with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Identity, and Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you broaden the scope of available data, which allows your security teams to see the complete story of an attack from start to finish, allowing them to strengthen security and remove exploitable vulnerabilities.

Now that you've completed this module, you should:

- How you can use Microsoft 365 Defender to better protect, identify, respond and remediate threats.
- Have an awareness of each of the Defender products: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft Cloud App Security, and how they integrate with Microsoft 365 Defender.
