The average employee spends more than an hour a day searching or recreating information that already exists in their organization. To solve this, Microsoft Viva Topics is an add-on for Microsoft 365 plans for commercial customers to address a key business issue by providing information to users when they need it.

Viva Topics is part of Microsoft Viva, an Employee Experience Platform (EXP) tool that helps unify and manage all aspects of employee experience in a single placeâ€”for onboarding, skill development, and knowledge.  

Viva Topics uses advanced AI and topic technology that help your people to learn, find knowledge, engage, and work for their wellbeing and the organization's success.  

## How does Viva Topics improve employee experience?

Viva Topics uses Microsoft AI technology, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Graph, Search, and other components and services to bring knowledge to your users in Microsoft 365, starting with SharePoint modern pages and Microsoft Search. Viva Topics can harness collective knowledge and empower your people to learn, upskill, and innovate faster through crowdsourcing of content.

Viva Topics discovers content through Microsoft Graph, a graph database in Microsoft 365. Microsoft Graph connects topics, content, and people across Microsoft 365 apps. Then Viva Topics organizes content into topics, to build summaries and connect them to people who are related to the Topics.

When content is created or shared in Microsoft 365 apps, the graph database records these activities as hints or signals as topics. AI and machine learning indexes these signals to predict future Topics your employees will likely want to see. As people in your organization engage or ignore the suggested Topics across Microsoft 365, Viva Topics will curate what content is most relevant for each of your end users.
