Power BI has two new ways to explore your data in a more natural and intuitive way.  First, decomposition trees can help with root cause analysis for specific issues and is a great way of exploring data that goes beyond just slicing and dicing data in the normal manner.  The visual lets users look at a specific datapoint and look at the surrounding points to determine what may be affecting the report.

Next, the Q&A Visual allows end users to ask questions of their data using natural language and get answers in the context of their report.  Artificial intelligence is used to analyze the data and automatically suggests relevant questions to help users get started.
