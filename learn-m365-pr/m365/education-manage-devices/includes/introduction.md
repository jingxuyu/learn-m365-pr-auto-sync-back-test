Microsoft provides tools to help you manage devices that are used for education.

Suppose that you're the administrator for a school. You'd want to ensure that your environment is secure, compliant with standards and regulations, and helps facilitate learning. There are different Microsoft tools that can help you, including Intune for Education, School Data Sync (SDS), and Microsoft's Take a Test app.

In this module, you'll access Intune for Education and use express configuration to choose apps and settings for your users and devices. Also, you'll explore how to plan and deploy School Data Sync to synchronize data into Intune for Education. Finally, you'll see how to set up a Take a Test profile to securely administer online tests.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Access Intune for Education.
- Use express configuration.
- Plan and deploy **Microsoft School Data Sync**.
- Configure **Take a Test** profiles.
