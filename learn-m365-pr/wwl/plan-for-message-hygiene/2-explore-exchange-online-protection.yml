    - content: "Configure Contoso's DNS MX record to point to Microsoft 365"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Install an EOP Send connector in the on-premises Exchange Server environment"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. EOP requires only an EOP Send connector in an on-premises Exchange Server environment so that messages are sent to the EOP domain for scanning."
    - content: "Configure Contoso's DNS PTR records"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. DNS PTR records are used in reverse DNS lookups. They aren't used by EOP. Try again."
