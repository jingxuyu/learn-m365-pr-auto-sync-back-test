Every product or service has a lifecycle, that includes product and services in Microsoft 365. Microsoft envisions, designs, develops, and tests everything internally. Once these features, products, and services are mature enough they're made available to test by the public in a preview release. After these tests succeed the feature, product, or service is released and becomes generally available.

Products that are at General Availability (GA) are fully supported and have regular updates to ensure they're secure and fully functional. Over time as more and more product releases take place older products can no longer be supported and they'll reach the end of support.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the service lifecycle in Microsoft 365.
- Describe private, public preview, and General Availability (GA) options.
- Describe use cases and capabilities for the Microsoft 365 Roadmap portal.
