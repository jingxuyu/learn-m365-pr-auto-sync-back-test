You know that SharePoint Syntex helps organize less-structured documents within your document libraries using document understanding models. SharePoint Syntex can also extract information from and classify _form_ documents, such as invoices and applicationsâ€“any documents that have a defined structure and uniform setup across all the document types.

The Accounting department at Contoso Electronics is eager to bring the power of SharePoint Syntex to the forms in their content libraries. They have recognized that manually processing purchase orders (POs) has taken up a considerable amount of time for members of the Accounting department. Manually processing forms has also resulted in _errors_, which have trickled down to other parts of the business, such as the Operations team, who need POs addressed properly. To create an automated and accurate process for reviewing and organizing these essential business documents, you will need to train the Accounting department to build form processing models.

Form processing works differently than document understanding models because forms are more predictable, more structured. Unlike document understanding models that originate in the content center, form processing models are created in the PowerApps AI Builder. AI Builder extracts information, references the model with a Power Automate flow, and runs the model on files uploaded to a specific library whenever a file is uploaded to it.

By the end of this module, you will know how to create a form processing model and how to apply it to a SharePoint library. You will understand how the model will assign content types and how training improves model fitness.
