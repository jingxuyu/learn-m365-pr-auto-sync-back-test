    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "You have a group of developers that need virtual desktops that they can manage. What type of host pool do you create for them?"
      choices:
      - content: "Personal"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "With a personal host pool, each user has their own dedicated VM. They can be a local administrator for their VM to manage app installation."
      - content: "Local"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Local isn't one of the host pool types."        
      - content: "Pooled"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Pooled desktops allow multiple user accounts to log into the same virtual machine. Typically these users wouldn't be local administrators on the VMs."
    - content: "If you create a pooled host pool, what VM image should you use?"
      choices:
      - content: "Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "It's one of the recommended images but you can choose an image you've built."
      - content: "VM image that can support multi-session and your workload"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "We recommend you use Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session for most use cases but you can use an image you've built."
      - content: "Windows 10"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can use Windows 10 for a personal host pool but not for pooled."
    - content: "You want to allow your users access to both apps and a remote desktop. How do you give them access?"
      choices:
      - content: "You can't. Users can only belong to one application group type."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Users can be assigned to multiple application groups."
      - content: "Create a RemoteApp application group and assign it to Azure AD users or groups."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Users will have access to the apps published to the application group but not to a remote desktop."
      - content: "Assign the RemoteApp and desktop application groups to your users."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You can assign users to both a desktop application group and a RemoteApp application group in the same host pool. But users can only launch one type of application group per session."
    - content: "Which of these steps is not part of creating an FSLogix profile?"
      choices:
      - content: "Create an Azure storage account with a file share"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. FSLogix profiles store user-assigned virtual disks in the file share in Azure."
      - content: "Create a new role in Azure AD to read and write in Azure storage"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. You need a new role in Azure AD to read and write in Azure storage so users can access and modify the virtual disks that contain their user profile."
      - content: "Install FSLogix software in Azure Virtual Desktop gallery images"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. FSLogix software is preinstalled in the Azure gallery images. If you use your own image, you'll need to install the FSLogix software yourself."
