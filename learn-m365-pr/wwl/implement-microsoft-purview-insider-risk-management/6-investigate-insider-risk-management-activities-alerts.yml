  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "What does insider risk management use to help protect and optimize an organization's risk investigation and review experience?"
    choices:
    - content: "Alert throttling"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Insider risk management uses built-in alert throttling to help protect and optimize an organization's risk investigation and review experience. Throttling guards against issues that may result in an overload of policy alerts. For example, misconfigured data connectors or DLP policies. As a result, there might be a delay in displaying new alerts for a user."
    - content: "User activity reports"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. User activity reports allow an organization to examine activities for specific users for a defined time period. However, it doesn't help protect and optimize an organization's risk investigation and review experience."
    - content: "Activity explorer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Activity explorer provides risk investigators and analysts with a comprehensive analytic tool that provides detailed information about alerts. However, it doesn't help protect and optimize an organization's risk investigation and review experience."
