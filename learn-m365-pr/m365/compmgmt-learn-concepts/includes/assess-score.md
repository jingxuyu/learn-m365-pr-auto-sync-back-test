Compliance Manager helps you prioritize which actions to focus on to improve your overall compliance posture by calculating your compliance score. The extent to which an improvement action impacts your compliance score depends on the relative risk it represents. Points are awarded based on whether the action risk level has been identified as a combination of the following action characteristics:
- Mandatory or discretionary
- Preventative, detective, or corrective

The image below shows the point value impact of each type of action on your compliance score. For example, implementation of a discretionary preventative action results in a compliance score increase of nine points.

  ![How is your compliance score calculated?](../media/compliance-score.png)

Your compliance score is expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by taking the total of the points achieved, either through implementing your actions or the actions Microsoft has implemented on your behalf, and dividing by the total of the possible number of points you could achieve. You can also look at your compliance score broken out in many ways using filters.

In our example, *Create customized DLP Policies for Company Sensitive Information* improvement action is a mandatory preventative control. Implementing, it would result in the achievement of 27 points.
