A Microsoft 365 tenant is a dedicated instance of the Microsoft 365 service that an organization receives and owns when it creates a relationship with Microsoft. Each Microsoft 365 tenant is unique and separate from other Microsoft 365 tenants. Your Microsoft 365 tenant is the set of services assigned to your organization. Typically, this tenant is associated with one or more of your public DNS domain names and acts as a central and isolated container for different subscriptions and the licenses within them that you assign to user accounts.

After ensuring that your networking is optimized for access to Microsoft 365 for both on-premises and remote workers, your next significant tasks are planning for and then configuring your Microsoft 365 tenant for DNS domain names, common services, and for that identity infrastructure that supports secure user sign in. To get your tenant ready for user, groups, licenses, and cloud apps, it's critical to carefully plan and execute your tenant configuration.

In this module, we examined the key areas that organizations must plan for to create their Microsoft 365 tenant. These areas included subscription options, tenant components, and the overall migration process.
