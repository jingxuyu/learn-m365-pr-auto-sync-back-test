The previous unit examined the steps that must be completed in the New DLP policy wizard to choose a built-in policy template. This unit picks up in the wizard where the previous unit left off.

The next page of the New DLP policy wizard lets you select the services you want to protect. You can choose the option titled "**All locations in Office 365**. **Includes Exchange email and SharePoint documents**," or you can choose specific locations that will be protected by your policy. The first option is selected by default, and it's referred to as an **org-wide policy**.

This example applies the policy to specific locations and protects Exchange email only.
