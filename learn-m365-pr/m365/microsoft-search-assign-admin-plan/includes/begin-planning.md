When it comes to finding information and getting answers, knowing your usersâ€™ needs is key. It helps ensure Microsoft Search delivers the information people in your organization want and need. Here are some things to consider:

- High-traffic sites or pages.
- Known user pain points when searching for information.
- Frequently used apps, tools, sites, and other information sources. For example, people looking for tools to book time off or instructions on how to reset a password.
- Policies or processes about employee benefits and enrollment information that's needed on a recurring basis, either seasonally or based on business cycles. Expense reports, quarterly reports, or company meetings, for example.
- Events, retreats, and conferences people in the organization sponsor or attend.

The admins from our scenario have compiled a list of information needed by their users. At the top of their list? An answer that shows users how to reset their password on their own. A review of help desk data backs this up. They're confident Microsoft Search can significantly reduce the number of support tickets by answering this and other common questions. Their next step is to build editorial answers from the Microsoft 365 admin center.
