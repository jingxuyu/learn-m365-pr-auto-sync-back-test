With guest access, you can provide access to teams, documents in channels, resources, chats, and applications to people outside your organization, while maintaining control over your corporate data. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you just want to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with people in other organizations, use external access. External access is a way for Teams users from an entire external domain to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with you in Teams. You can also use external access to communicate with people from other organizations who are still using Skype for Business (online and on-premises) and Skype (in preview).

A guest is someone who isn't an employee, student, or member of your organization. They don't have a school or work account with your organization. For example, guests may include partners, vendors, suppliers, or consultants. Anyone who isn't part of your organization can be added as guest in Teams. This means that anyone with a business account (that is, an Azure Active Directory account) or consumer email account (with Outlook.com, Gmail.com or others) can participate as a guest in Teams, with access to teams and channel experiences.

Guests in Teams are covered by the same compliance and auditing protection as the rest of Microsoft 365. Guest access is subject to Azure AD and Microsoft 365 service limits. As a Teams administrator, you have full control over which features and services a guest can or can't have access to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even if you activate Guest access in Teams, you must also ensure that Guest access is enabled in Azure AD.

## Configure guest access 

### Use Teams admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true).

2. Select **Users** > **Guest access**.

3. Set **Allow guest access in Teams** to **On**.

4. Under **Calling**, **Meeting**, and **Messaging**, select **On** or **Off** for each capability, depending on what you want to allow for guest users.

5. Select **Save**.

### Use PowerShell

You can also use PowerShell to toggle guest access with ```Set-CsTeamsClientConfiguration``` cmdlet. For example, to allow guest users globally, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsClientConfiguration -AllowGuestUser $True -Identity Global
```

Then you can use the following cmdlets to customize the guest access settings:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsGuestCallingConfiguration
Set-CsTeamsGuestMeetingConfiguration
Set-CsTeamsGuestMessagingConfiguration
```
