>The Workplace Analytics web app is being rebranded to **Viva Insights** in the next few months. As mentioned in this module, Workplace Analytics refers to the web app with advanced analysis tools and accelerators available to those who are assigned the Analyst, Limited Analyst, or Admin role.

Microsoft Workplace Analytics provides advanced insights about the way organizations collaborate and how work gets done. Setting up Workplace Analytics requires collaboration between the Microsoft 365 admin and the Workplace Analytics admin, who typically work under the direction of an overall program manager.

This module explains how people in these roles work together to set up Workplace Analytics:

- Assign licenses and roles
- Make privacy and configuration settings
- Prepare and upload organizational data

After these steps are completed, the Workplace Analytics web app will be available with 13 months of historical organizational and collaboration data by default.

>[!NOTE]
>The actual historical data available depends on the archiving policies that have been applied to employees' Exchange online mailboxes.

## Example scenario

You are an IT Project Leader at Contoso Corporation, which recently acquired Viva Insights or Workplace Analytics licenses for the entire company. Working with Alex, a Microsoft 365 global admin, and Taylor, a Human Resources analyst who will serve as the Workplace Analytics admin, you have been asked to get Workplace Analytics set up and operational for the business. This team will need to get input from the right stakeholders to decide how to configure Workplace Analytics, such as uploading Contoso's organizational data and Microsoft 365 collaboration data.
