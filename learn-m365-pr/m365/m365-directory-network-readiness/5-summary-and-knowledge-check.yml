quiz:
    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "If your organization uses Office 365 services like Exchange Online or SharePoint Online, youâ€™re already using Azure AD."
      choices:
      - content: "True"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Yes, Office 365 services use Azure AD for identity and access management."
      - content: "False"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Office 365 services use Azure AD for identity and access management."
      
    - content: "How much bandwidth does the initial migration of a user's profile in Window consume?"
      choices:
      - content: "More than 20 GB"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Yes, bandwidth consumption often exceeds 20 GB when you migrate user state from an old PC or older version of Windows to a new one. When you're planning how much bandwidth you need, consider storage, the time it takes to transfer files off and back onto a PC, matching user state to the correct devices, and the steps needed to safely delete temporary files after migration."
      - content: "1 TB"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "No, this is false. While some users might have 1 TB of user state data, in those cases you should assess the types and ages of their files before you migrate that much data. You might want to block unwanted file types or skip files that haven't been accessed in a set time period (like your document archival requirements)."
      - content: "300 GB"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "No, this is false. While some users might have 300 GB of user state data, in those cases you should assess the types and ages of their files before you migrate that much data. You might want to block unwanted file types or skip files that haven't been accessed in a set time period (like your document archival requirements)."

    - content: "What's one of the primary functions of Azure Active Directory?"
      choices:
      - content: "Controlling access to apps, data, and resources in Office 365 and other Microsoft cloud services"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Yes, this one of Azure AD's primary functions. Azure AD manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization."
      - content: "Assessing readiness"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "No, this is false. Azure AD isn't a readiness assessment tool."
      - content: "Controlling user settings across devices."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "No, controlling user settings across devices isn't one of Azure AD's primary functions. Some capabilities, like roaming the most recently used files in Office 365 ProPlus or enterprise state roaming in Windows, do use Azure AD, but Azure AD's primary function is controlling access to your apps."
