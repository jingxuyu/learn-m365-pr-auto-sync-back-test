Windows Virtual Desktop provides tools and approaches to automate scaling virtual machine resources within host pools. One of the primary benefits to hosting your Remote Desktop Service in the cloud is that you can shut down compute resources to save costs during off-peak hours, and then restart them on schedule or dynamically, based on session host utilization. 

The Windows Virtual Desktop scaling scripts include logic to periodically determine activity levels in virtual machines before draining underutilized user session hosts and shutting them down. During off-peak usage time (usually after hours) the script can reduce the number of running virtual machines; during peek usage, the script can dynamically provision additional virtual machines when user density exceeds pre-defined thresholds to trigger scaling. 

You can download the scaling scripts from the [scaling script repository](https://aka.ms/WVDscaling) in GitHub. They currently run in the context of a connected virtual machine using scheduled tasks. In the future, scaling operations will use Azure Automation.
