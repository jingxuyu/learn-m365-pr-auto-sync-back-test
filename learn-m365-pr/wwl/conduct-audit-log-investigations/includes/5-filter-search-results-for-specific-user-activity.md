Besides searching for a specific user or activity, you can also filter the results of an audit log search for a specific user or activity. By doing so, you can initially create a wide search and then filter the results to see specific events. You can then narrow the search criteria and rerun the search to return a smaller, more concise set of results. A possible example would be to filter for all password-related activities.

To filter the results:

1.  Run an audit log search.
2.  When the results are displayed, select **Filter results**. Keyword boxes are displayed under each column header.
3.  Select one of the boxes under a column header and type a word or phrase, depending on the column you're filtering on. The results will dynamically readjust to display the events that match your filter.<br><br>:::image type="content" source="../media/audit-log-search-results-e95bc29f.png" alt-text="screenshot showing results of an audit log search":::

4.  To clear a filter, select the **X** in the filter box or just select **Hide filtering**.

> *To display events from the Exchange admin audit log, type a **-** (dash) in the **Activity** filter box. By doing so, the cmdlet names will be displayed in the **Activity** column for Exchange admin events. You can then sort the cmdlet names in alphabetical order.*<br>
