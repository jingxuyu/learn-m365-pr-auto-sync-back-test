When a driver package is in the driver store, any user can connect a device, and the driver installation will begin. This is very user friendly since the user can start using devices without assistance. However, it also makes it challenging for IT departments, who may not be able to support a broad range of devices. In the past, some companies prevented users from connecting USB devices by physically preventing the use of USB ports, but this solution isn't very flexible.

Windows includes several Group Policy settings that control installation of devices and device drivers. This enables you to restrict installation of specific devices, but allows installation of all others devices. For example, you can use these Group Policy settings to restrict certain types of USB devices and installation of all devices that aren't allowed explicitly, such as USB keys that aren't company-approved.

### Driver installation

To access the Group Policy settings for controlling driver installation, in Group Policy, select **Computer Configuration, Policies**, select **Administrative Templates**, select **System**, and then select **Driver Installation**. The following table details the Group Policy settings that you can configure.
