Teams Phone includes the functionality to use Teams for calling to and from the traditional PSTN. It requires some configuration before users can make and receive calls and to use all the provided features.

Microsoft Calling plans or Operator Connect for your PSTN must be configured before phone numbers can be assigned to users. Direct Routing configuration is covered in a following module.

Emergency calling locations are required to meet legal requirements in many countries/regions and must also be configured before users can be assigned phone numbers.

You will then review key Phone System Policy configuration with calling policies, dial plans, call park, caller ID, and inbound call blocking.

"Audio Conferencing" is Microsoft's name for adding PSTN phone numbers and inbound and outbound dialing for Teams Meetings. Since this also involves PSTN numbers, the Teams voice engineer is also responsible for it.
