An organization must sometimes share its applications and services with guest users from another organization. Such sharing must be done securely so the organization maintains control over its corporate data. To help with application and service sharing, an organization must properly implement solutions that support external access by its partner organizations.

In this module, you learned how to enable external access across various solutions. These solutions included Azure Active Directory Business to Business (B2B) collaboration, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, and Customer Lockbox.

This module introduced you to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Business-to-Business (B2B) collaboration. You learned how this feature supports safe and secure collaboration with external partners, whatever their size, even if they don't have Azure AD or an IT department. This module examined how the Azure AD B2B collaboration process uses a simple invitation and redemption process. This process lets partners use their own credentials to access a company's resources.

You then learned why external sharing in Microsoft 365 (OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Unified Groups, and so on) and Azure AD B2B collaboration are technically the same thing. All external sharing (except OneDrive/SharePoint Online), including guests in Microsoft 365 Groups, already uses the Azure AD B2B collaboration invitation APIs for sharing. While these solutions are technically the same, there are some underlying differences, which you covered in this training.

The module then examined how Microsoft Teams enables communication and collaboration with people outside your organization, just like Azure AD B2B collaboration. But you also learned that while they offer similar functionality, Teams provides two different ways to make that happen - through external access (federation) and guest access.

The module concluded by reviewing how organizations use Microsoft's Customer Lockbox feature to control how a Microsoft support engineer accesses your data. When you need a Microsoft support engineer to help fix an issue, you can require that they first submit a Customer Lockbox request. This request enables you to control whether to give the support engineer access to your data. There's also an expiration time on the request, and content access is removed after the support engineer has fixed the issue.
