With any business process, it is important to clearly define the key tasks and who will be responsible for them.

Thinking about Contoso Electronics, identifying the roles and their responsibilities will be particularly helpful, considering the wide variety of already existing roles within your organization.

For Syntex, there are four main roles you will need to designate and assign:

- SharePoint/Knowledge admin
- Power Platform admin
- Knowledge manager
- Model owner

Here is a brief overview of each role and their primary responsibilities, which we’ll explore more closely in this section:

- **SharePoint/Knowledge admin**: Enable AI Builder, create content centers, and maintain Syntex going forward, including user permissions and access.

- **Power Platform admin**: Configure the data service environment for form processing and purchase and allocate audio index blob (AIB) credits.

- **Knowledge manager**: Establish best practices and use cases for utilizing Syntex.

- **Model owner**: Own, create, and oversee document understanding and/or form processing models.

You will see how the roles within your organization can easily align with the responsibilities necessary to successfully set up and administer SharePoint Syntex for your organization.

## What are the SharePoint/Knowledge admin roles and responsibilities?

The SharePoint/Knowledge admin will need to not only establish your organization’s Syntex instance but also maintain it on an ongoing basis. They will need to have the SharePoint admin role in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The SharePoint admin will configure form processing in individual SharePoint document libraries and set up the default content center and additional content centers for document understanding models, as needed. The SharePoint admin is also responsible for assigning and controlling permissions for who can access and utilize the content center.  

At Contoso Electronics, you will want to utilize someone who has a role that already deals with administrative or organizational tasks, while also has a strong understanding of what different roles within the organization need from their document libraries. For instance, a technical writer may be ideal for this role since they understand documentation. An administrative assistant may also be a good option, considering their understanding for the organization’s structure and their predominant focus on clerical tasks.

## What are the Power Platform admin roles and responsibilities?

The Power Platform admin is a role defined in the Microsoft 365 admin center. An administrator who has been configured with this role is necessary because they manage the Power Apps AI Builder capabilities within each SharePoint document library, enabling form processing. They will be responsible for configuring the data service environment for form processing, as well as purchasing and allocating Azure Image Builder (AIB) credits.  

Based on these requirements for the role, you will want to utilize someone on your team who has a similar skillset as your SharePoint/Knowledge admin. They need to be someone who has clerical and organizational knowledge to provide the necessary access to AI Builder, as well as a technical understanding of the entire Power Platform environment and AIB credits.

Considering this, within Contoso Electronics, the same technical writer may be ideal as your Power Platform admin since they know the documentation process. You could also consider the IT admin, who already handles the IT operations of your organization and is familiar with the more backend, admin responsibilities of your company.

## What are the knowledge manager roles and responsibilities?

The knowledge manager will be less of an admin and more of an overseer of the models themselves. They are the ones who pinpoint and aggregate the specific use cases for content understanding that apply to your organization’s needs and pain points. They will establish the best practices and guidelines for using Syntex, as enacted by the model owners themselves. The knowledge manager also reviews the models on a regular basis, checking the model analytics to ensure that models are working properly and evaluating the information they are returning.

You will want to appoint someone that works closely with your document libraries on a day-to-day basis, as well as works with the model owners themselves. This could potentially be your organization’s customer service manager or sales manager since they manage contracts and other important customer information. They will have a good sense of what the organization of this information looks like currently and what is necessary to improve the process.

## What are the model owner roles and responsibilities?

The model owner is just that – they own the use of the models, creating and overseeing the document understanding and/or form processing models. They are the champions or advocates for the models and their use, so they should be closely tied to the input and output of the models. As champions for these models, they will also need to gather real business use cases within your organization to apply Syntex to simplify operations. They will then need to make these use cases a reality by creating document understanding models within the content center, building form processing models directly in the necessary document libraries, and applying already created models as needed.  

The owner of model creation within Contoso Electronics can look different depending on the organization’s need. Salespeople themselves may be a desirable choice for owning the models, as they may be working the most with the customer information and need to create and apply models as needed to make processing and understanding of customer information easier.  

On the other hand, salespeople may not want to spend this time on the backend, potentially taking time away from working with directly with customers, so another member of your team responsible for owning content may be a more apt choice as model owner. It can also vary depending on department, considering that different model owners for different sectors of the business can allow for more specific understanding of what is needed in each of the department document libraries.
