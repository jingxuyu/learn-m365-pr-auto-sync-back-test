In earlier training, you learned how Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides email and collaboration protection through features such as Safe Attachments, Safe Links, and Zero-hour auto purge. In this module, you examined other threat protection features provided by Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

The module began with an introduction to the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protection stack. You learned about the four layers in this stack, and the protection that each provides.

You then examined several threat intelligence features in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. These features included Threat Explorer, Threat Trackers, and Attack simulation training. You learned that Threat Explorer and Threat Trackers provide admins with evidence-based knowledge and actionable advice. Admins can use this information to make informed decisions about protecting and responding to cyber-attacks against their tenant.

You then were introduced to Attack simulation training. This training feature provides realistic attack scenarios to help organizations identify vulnerable users before a real attack happens. You learned he goal of Attack simulation training is two-part:

 -  To make employees aware of various threat attacks.
 -  To change employee behavior, so they learn what not to do when receiving email with links and attachments and so on.
