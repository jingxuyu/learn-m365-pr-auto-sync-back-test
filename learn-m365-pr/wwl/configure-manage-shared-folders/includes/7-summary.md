Shared folders provide the ability for multiple users to access data from across the network. When configuring folders for sharing, it's important to set correct permissions to prevent unauthorized access. Remote users can access the share using the UNC address of the host computer and the name of the share. Shares can be configured using File explore, the Shared Folders snap-in, or using command-line tools. When resource access combines shared and NTFS permissions, the most restrictive permissions are the resulting permissions.
