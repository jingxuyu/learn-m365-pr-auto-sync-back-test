Understanding how a ransomware attack happens and its impact on your business or identity is the first step to defend yourself against it. Almost 50% of targeted organizations and institutions end up paying a ransom and more than 50% of victims weren't able to recover their data.

## Steps to prevent ransomware attacks

There are many ways for an organization or individual to mitigate the risks of a ransomware attack.

They can be categorized as follows:

- **Enabling and maintaining security and monitoring tools**: For example, keeping software, including antimalware software and firewalls, up-to-date.
- **Good device hygiene**: Including only installing software from trusted sources and official websites.
- **Maintaining good user practices**: Avoid using administrator accounts with specialized access and permissions for everyday business. Use strong passwords and regularly reset them.
- **Maintaining safe data practices**: Such as limiting or avoiding sharing personal information whenever possible.
- **Safe peripheral usage**: For example, refrain from connecting unprotected removable devices to computers, laptops, and even mobile devices.

### For businesses

Train all your employees to consider best practices while doing day-to-day tasks. Make members of your organization aware of the undesirable consequences that can be caused by a security lapse. Here are some security measures that might help:

- Ensure all corporate devices, systems, and applications are up-to-date.
- Regularly detect data exfiltration and breaches.
- Continually test your systems and devices.
- Implement and monitor the use of privileged accounts.
- Keep your remote working devices and equipment secure.
- Equip your employees with regular cybersecurity awareness and training.
- Consider cyber liability insurance.

## Zero Trust security framework

A Zero Trust security framework requires all users to validate at every stage while accessing resources and information within an organization. The term Zero Trust implies "never trust". This security model is designed to always verify users with various authentication methods. The Zero Trust framework is built upon three key principles: verify identity, limit access, and assume breach.
