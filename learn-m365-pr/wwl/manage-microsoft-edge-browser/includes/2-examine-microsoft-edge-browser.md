The Microsoft Edge browser is a cross-platform browser that is available for Windows. Microsoft Edge replaces the older Internet Explorer browser that previously shipped with Windows. Microsoft Edge is a modern browser with an interface that is more simple and intuitive to use, increases performance, and provides options that users can configure with touch on or off.

Microsoft Edge has many features that allow you to be more productive when browsing websites. These features can improve reading speed, accomplish actions quicker, and help to browse websites more easily. Below are some of the highlights of features in Microsoft Edge.

### Pinned tabs and toolbars

In Microsoft Edge, you can pin tabs to the tab row. Pinned tabs take up less space because they only display the site icon, and they reappear when you close and reopen Microsoft Edge. You can customize the taskbar by pinning frequently used tools and features such as:

 -  Favorites
 -  Collections
 -  Downloads
 -  Browser history
 -  Downloads
 -  Extensions
 -  Performance

### Collections<br>

Collections allow you to easily collect, organize and share content that you find across the web. Collections provide a side panel that allows you to add pages or drag objects into the panel. This provides an easy way to perform actions such as comparing items when shopping or collecting information for planning a trip or event.

### Synchronization of settings

Previous versions of Microsoft Edge were tied to the Microsoft framework, leveraging solutions such as Enterprise State Roaming to synchronize settings. With Microsoft Edge Chromium (version 77 and later), this is no longer the case. The sync solution is no longer tied to the Windows sync ecosystem. This enables Microsoft Edge to work across all the platforms, such as Windows 8.1, iOS, Android and macOS. This also enables us to offer sync for non-primary accounts on Windows. The data supported by sync includes:

 -  Favorites
 -  Passwords
 -  Addresses and more (form-fill)
 -  Collections
 -  Settings
 -  Open tabs
 -  Extensions

### Pivot between profiles

Microsoft Edge allows you to easily switch credentials when you want to change your experience on different devices. For example, if you are working from home using your home computer, switching to your work profile allows you access to all your favorites and collections that were configured on your work devices.

### Paste and go

If you copy a link to the clipboard, you can right-click in the Microsoft Edge address bar, and then select **Paste and go**. This will make Microsoft Edge instantly go to the site. If the text that you have in the clipboard is not a link, then the **Paste and search** option will appear. Microsoft Edge will then use the default search engine to search for the clipboard text.

### Web notifications

Notifications in the Action Center can be from sites that support notifications. Notifications will make it possible for you to respond more quickly. You can configure which sites display notifications. If you have a site open in an InPrivate window, then notifications from that site will not display in the Action Center due to security reasons.

### Immersive Reader (Reading view)

Microsoft Edge includes a reading view that focuses on the text displayed on the page, and if possible, removes the pictures. This can improve your reading speed. You can switch the reading view on and off by right-clicking on the page and selecting Immersive Reader. You can also use the hotkey F9.

### Additional new or improved features

Microsoft Edge includes a number of features that make it easier to use on a touch device, including:

 -  Better accessibility features
 -  Improved battery life
 -  Better browsing experience in popular websites as a result of improved HTML5 compatibility and now based on Chromium
 -  Improved security by using kernel attack protection, which makes attacks on the kernel less successful
 -  Better management of favorites including creating folders for favorites and importing favorites from other browsers
 -  Compatible sites can use Windows Hello to improve user authentication for a faster sign in experience

> [!NOTE]
> Because favorites are stored in a database, you cannot use File Explorer to manage your favorites in Microsoft Edge. Microsoft Edge stores favorites in a database in the following folder: %LocalAppData%\\Packages\\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge\_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\AC\\MicrosoftEdge\\User\\Default\\DataStore\\Data\\nouser1\\120712-0049\\DBStore.

### Options and settings

Microsoft Edge provides additional configuration options in the Settings and more menu (the ellipsis at the top right). This opens a window where some of the options that display are:

 -  **New InPrivate window.** Browse sites with additional privacy. This topic is covered in more depth later in this lesson.
 -  **Zoom.** This allows you to zoom in or out.
 -  **Find on page**. This is a text box in which you can enter text to search for, on the open webpage.
 -  **Print**. This allows you to print your webpage.
 -  **Extensions**. This shows the installed extensions, and includes a link to Microsoft Edge Add-ons for installing additional extensions.
 -  **Help and feedback** &gt; **What's new and tips**. This opens the Microsoft Edge Tips page where you can learn how to use Microsoft Edge more efficiently.
 -  **Settings**. Some of the settings you can configure in Microsoft Edge are:
    
     -  **Appearance**. This allows you to choose between light and dark themes, show favorites bar, collections, feedback button, and setting the Home button.
     -  **Profiles**. This allows you to manage your account, sync, passwords, stored payment information, import favorites, and multiple profile preferences.
     -  **Privacy and services**. This is where you define privacy settings. This can include tracking level, allowing what data to send, smart screen settings, and clearing history and saved data.
     -  **Phone and other devices**. This option allows you to set up sync of settings between other devices you use.
