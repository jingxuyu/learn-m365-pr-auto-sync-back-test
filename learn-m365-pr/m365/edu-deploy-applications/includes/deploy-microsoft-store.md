Any device used in a classroom environment needs applications. Some of these will be free, others will need to be purchased. Managing access to applications, distribution and licensing costs can become overwhelming.  Microsoft Store for Education can simplify the selection, deployment, and licensing of apps on your school's PCs.

Here, you'll learn how to configure and use the Microsoft Store for Education.

## Microsoft Store for Education overview

Microsoft Store for Education gives schools a flexible way to find, acquire, manage, and distribute free and paid apps to Windows 10 devices. You can manage Microsoft Store apps and private line-of-business apps in one inventory, plus assign and reuse licenses as needed.

## Get apps and content

You can browse and search for all products in the Store for Education catalog. There are both free and paid-for applications. Applications are added to the Store for Education so you should check back from time to time. Currently, you can pay for apps with a credit card, and some items can be paid for with an invoice. Additional payment options are planned for future releases.

There are two applications types in the Store for Education

- Universal Windows Platform applications
- Universal Windows applications by device: Phone, Surface Hub, IOT devices, and HoloLens

Applications purchased from the Store for Education only work on Windows 10 devices.

Line-of-business (LOB) apps are also supported through Microsoft Store. You can invite IT developers or ISVs to be LOB publishers for your organization. This allows them to submit apps via the developer center that are only available to your organization through Store for Education. These apps can be distributed using the distribution methods discussed in this topic. For more information, see **Working with Line-of-Business applications** in the Learn more section.

## Application licensing model

There are two licensing options in Store for Education; online and offline. The default is online and is similar to the licensing model for Microsoft Store. Online licensed apps require users and devices to connect to Microsoft Store services to acquire an app and its license. Offline licensing is a new licensing option for Windows 10. With offline licenses, organizations can cache apps and their licenses to deploy within their network. ISVs or devs can opt in their apps for offline licensing when they submit them to the developer center.

## Distribute applications

The distribution of applications is done through two channels:

- Microsoft Store for Education
- Using a management tool.

You can use either, or both distribution methods in your organization.

### Distribute with Store for Education

- Email link â€“ After purchasing an app, Admins can send employees a link in an email message. Employees can Select the link to install the app.
- Curate private store for all employees â€“ A private store can include content youâ€™ve purchased from Microsoft Store for Business, and your line-of-business apps that youâ€™ve submitted to Microsoft Store for Business. Apps in your private store are available to all of your employees. They can browse the private store and install apps when needed.
- To use the options above users must be signed in with an Azure AD account on a Windows 10 device. Licenses are assigned as individuals install apps.

### Using a management tool

For larger organizations that want a greater level of control over how apps are distributed and managed, a management tool provides other distribution options:

- Scoped content distribution â€“ Ability to scope content distribution to specific groups of employees.
- Install apps for employees â€“ Employees are not responsible for installing apps. Management tool installs apps for employees.

Management tools can synchronize content that has been acquired in the Store for Education. If an offline application has been purchased this will also include the app package, license and metadata for the app (like, icons, count, or localized product descriptions). Using the metadata, management tools can enable portals or apps as a destination for employees to acquire apps.

## Distribute apps to your employees from Microsoft Store for Education

Distribute apps to your employees from Microsoft Store for Education. You can assign apps to employees, or let employees install them from your private store.

The private store was created when you signed up for Microsoft Store. Applications in the private store can viewed and downloaded. Your private store is available as a tab in Microsoft Store app, and is usually named for your company or organization. Only apps with online licenses can be added to the private store. You can make an app available in your private store when you acquire the app, or you can do it later from your inventory.

#### Download offline-licensed app

Offline licensing is a new feature in Windows 10 and allows apps to be deployed to devices that aren't connected to the Internet. This means organizations can deploy apps when users or devices don't have connectivity to the Store.

Microsoft Store for Education provides a set of Admin management APIs. If your organization develops scripts or tools, these APIs allow Admins to programmatically manage items in **Apps & software**. For more information, see **REST API reference for Microsoft Store for Business** in the Learn more section.

You can download a preview PowerShell script that uses REST APIs. The script is available from PowerShell Gallery. You can use to the script to:

- View items in inventory (Apps & software)
- Manage licenses - assigning and removing
- Perform bulk options using .csv files - this automates license management for customers with large numbers of licenses

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Store for Business and Education Admin role is required to manage products and to use the MSStore module. This requires advanced knowledge of PowerShell.
