Although you can save files to the local hard disk in Windows client, several additional storage options are available. This module describes some of the different storage technologies, including different types of server-based and cloud-based storage.

This module will also cover considerations for configuring storage for use in Windows client. While the default settings for a disk drive will be sufficient for most scenarios when installing Windows, there are additional options available for advanced configurations, such as clients with multiple storage drives or specific partition requirements.

You can use disk management tools to perform disk-related tasks, such as creating and formatting partitions and volumes, assigning drive letters, and resizing disks.
