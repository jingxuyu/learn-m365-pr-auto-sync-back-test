There are some deployment scenarios in which you install Office again where you already have an existing installation of the same version of Office. This is what we call a second install. You can use a second install to add to an existing Office installation or change what's there. Use a second install to:

- Add Visio or Project to an existing Office installation.
- Add a language pack.
- Add Office preferences.
- Migrate a 32-bit installation of Office to 64-bit.
- Change the servicing channel or update path.

Similar to the update process, the second install process looks at what's already on the device, compares it with the package and properties you want to install, and then applies what's different.

In many of the examples described above, there are corresponding Group Policy settings you could use to change these configurations. For targeted changes or if it's easier for you to make these changes using software distribution tools versus working with teams or individuals who manage Active Directory Group Policy settings, a second install is a great option.
