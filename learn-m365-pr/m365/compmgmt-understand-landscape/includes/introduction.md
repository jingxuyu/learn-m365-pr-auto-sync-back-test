Organizations must comply with a complex and evolving web of policies, industry standards and regional regulations, and cope with the increasing cost of non-compliance. In fact, there are over 220 updates per day from over 1,000 regulatory bodies, making it challenging to keep up to date with the rapidly changing compliance landscape.

Suppose you work at an electronics company. After you've been responsible for IT security for a while, you are also asked to take on responsibility for compliance. The research you've done so far indicates this new responsibility will be a significant challenge. As an example, one regulation your organization is subject to is hundreds of pages long. It's also not clear how the requirements of the regulations map to the capabilities of the products you are using and your organization's policies and procedures. You need to learn more about the topic, understand what solutions are available to help you apply best practices and to comply with the regulations and standards applicable to your organization.

In this module, you will learn why compliance management has become so important and be introduced to Microsoft's solution for compliance management. You will gain an understanding of some of the most common use cases and be presented with a proposed compliance management journey using Microsoft Compliance Manager.

By the end of this module, you will be more familiar with the compliance management landscape and how Microsoft can help you simplify compliance and reduce risk.
