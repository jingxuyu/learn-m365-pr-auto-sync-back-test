In the past, meeting participants found it difficult to configure and join meetings using previous tools. You want to understand how Microsoft Teams can help your organization's teams to have more productive meetings going forward.

## Microsoft Teams features and functionalities for meetings

Meetings help teams to share status updates, brainstorm ideas, and solve issues together. Your organization's teams will need to collaborate on projects through meetings regularly.

Microsoft Teams is designed to help you have more productive meetings. Microsoft Teams comes with many different features and capabilities that you can use to help your teams to quickly engage and improve how they work together through meetings:

- **Scheduling and joining meetings**: Users can join meetings through links, their calendars, or call in to meetings using their phones. A user's calendar in Teams is connected to their Exchange calendar. So when users schedule a meeting in Outlook, their meeting is automatically visible and accessible from Teams, and the other way around. Users can also start meetings whenever they want, without scheduling them.
- **Multi-party meetings**: Multiple parties can join a single meeting. For example, an internal team can join a meeting with an external team of users. Microsoft Teams provides a gallery view for meetings that will show all participants up to nine participants at a time
- **Meeting devices**: Users can start and join meetings with specialized devices they use daily. For example, team members on the ground at a construction site can jump on from a mobile device, to share live updates on progress and issues.
- **Content sharing in meetings**: Users can share individual screens, windows, and files during a meeting. They can also use whiteboards to sketch ideas and share notes:<br />:::image type="content" source="../media/3-content-sharing-meetings.png" alt-text="Content Sharing in Meetings":::
