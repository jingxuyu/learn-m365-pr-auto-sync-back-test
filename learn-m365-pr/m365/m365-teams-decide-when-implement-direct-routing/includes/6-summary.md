In your clothing retail company, you were using a third-party private branch exchange (PBX) system to handle telephony. You wanted to know if you could replace it with Direct Routing, integrated with your new Microsoft Teams implementation and how that change would affect productivity and costs. You've seen how Direct Routing can handle common and advanced PBX functionality, including service numbers and emergency numbers, reduce costs and integrate all voice communications.

Many organizations are used to separate telephony systems that don't integrate well with internet-based audio and video conferencing, chats, and project management tools. By implementing Direct Routing in Teams, you can remove such barriers to communication and improve productivity in your company.

Now you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Assess if Direct Routing is the right choice for your organization.
- Describe the benefits of Direct Routing.
- Explain what issues to consider when you plan Direct Routing.
