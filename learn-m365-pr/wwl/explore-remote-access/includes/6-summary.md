The module explored the benefits of using virtual private networks to remotely access data. VPNs allow clients to access resources remotely, as if they were connected directly to the organization's network. VPN traffic is encapsulated with the necessary routing information and encrypted to ensure confidentiality across public networks.

Always On VPN enables clients to seemlessly establish VPN connections as needed, without the user needing to manually connect when accessing network resources.
