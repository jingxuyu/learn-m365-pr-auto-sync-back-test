## Enforce secure devices

### Ensure that administrators use compliant devices

Ensure that devices used for administrative tasks follow your security policies. For example, an organization might require users to access sensitive resources only by using managed devices.

With Azure AD Conditional Access, you can require administrators to register their mobile devices with Azure AD. You can also configure Microsoft Intune to ensure that administrators' devices meet compliance policies.

A device that Azure AD marks as compliant ensures that it:

- Is managed by your organization.
- Complies with company security requirements.
