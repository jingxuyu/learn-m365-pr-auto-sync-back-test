An organization's exposure score is visible in the Threat and Vulnerability Management dashboard of the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. It reflects how vulnerable your organization is to cybersecurity threats. A low exposure score means your devices are less vulnerable from exploitation. An organization's enterprise and security administrators should:

 -  Quickly understand and identify high-level takeaways about the state of security in their organization.
 -  Detect and respond to areas that require investigation or action to improve the current state.
 -  Communicate with peers and management about the effect of security efforts.

The exposure scorecard gives an organization a high-level view of its exposure score's trend over time. Any spikes in trend line provide a visual indication of a high cybersecurity threat exposure that needs further investigation.

The exposure score is broken down into the following levels:

 -  **0-29**. Low exposure score.
 -  **30-69**. Medium exposure score.
 -  **70-100**. High exposure score.

### Reduce your threat and vulnerability exposure

Cybersecurity weaknesses identified in an organization are mapped to actionable security recommendations and prioritized by their effect. Prioritized recommendations help shorten the time to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities and drive compliance.

Organizations can lower their threat and vulnerability exposure by remediating the issues based on prioritized [security recommendations](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-security-recommendation?azure-portal=true). Each software has weaknesses that are transformed into recommendations and prioritized based on risk to the organization. As such, an organization can have the greatest effect on its exposure score by remediating the top security recommendations. These recommendations can be viewed in the Threat and Vulnerability Management dashboard.

### Security recommendations - threat and vulnerability management

Each security recommendation includes actionable remediation steps. To help with task management, the recommendation can also be sent using Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. When the threat landscape changes, the recommendation also changes as it continuously collects information from your environment.

> [!TIP]
> To get emails about new vulnerability events, see [Configure vulnerability email notifications in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-vulnerability-email-notifications?azure-portal=true).

Each device in the organization is scored based on three important factors. These factors help customers focus on the right things at the right time:

 -  **Threat**. Characteristics of the vulnerabilities and exploits in your organizations' devices and breach history. Based on these factors, the security recommendations show the corresponding links to:
     -  active alerts
     -  ongoing threat campaigns
     -  their corresponding threat analytic reports
 -  **Breach likelihood**. The organization's security posture and resilience against threats.
 -  **Business value**. The organization's assets, critical processes, and intellectual properties.

The Security recommendations page can be accessed in two ways:

 -  **Threat and Vulnerability Management** navigation menu in the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal**. Select **Recommendations**. The page contains a list of security recommendations for the threats and vulnerabilities found in the organization.
 -  **Top security recommendations** in the **Threat and Vulnerability Management** dashboard. In a given day as a Security Administrator, you can take a look at the threat and vulnerability management dashboard to see your exposure score side by side with your [Microsoft Secure Score for Devices](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-microsoft-secure-score-devices?azure-portal=true). The goal is to lower your organization's exposure from vulnerabilities, and increase your organization's device security to be more resilient against cybersecurity threat attacks. The top security recommendations list can help you achieve that goal
    
    The top security recommendations window list the improvement opportunities for an organization. The opportunities are prioritized using the factors previously mentioned - threat, likelihood to be breached, and value. Selecting a recommendation will take you to the **Security recommendations** page with more details.

### Security recommendations overview

The **Security recommendations** page displays the following information:

 -  number of weaknesses found
 -  related components
 -  threat insights
 -  number of exposed devices
 -  status
 -  remediation type
 -  remediation activities
 -  effect to your exposure score and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices
 -  associated tags

On the **Exposed devices** graph, the colors change as the trend changes. If the number of exposed devices is on the rise, the color changes into red. If there's a decrease in the number of exposed devices, the color of the graph will change into green.

> [!NOTE]
> Threat and vulnerability management shows devices that were in use up to 30 days ago. This design is different from the rest of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. In that service, a device has an **Inactive** status if it hasn't been in use for more than seven days.

The **Security recommendations** page enables an organization to explore security recommendation options. Select the security recommendation that you want to investigate or process. The detail pane that appears for the selected recommendation allows you to choose any of the following options:

 -  **Open software page**. Open the software page to get more context on the software and how it's distributed. The information can include threat context, associated recommendations, weaknesses discovered, number of exposed devices, discovered vulnerabilities, names and detailed of devices with the software installed, and version distribution.
 -  **Remediation options**. Submit a remediation request to open a ticket in Microsoft Intune for your IT administrator to pick up and address. Track the remediation activity in the **Remediation** page.
 -  **Exception options**. Submit an exception, provide justification, and set exception duration if you can't remediate the issue yet.

> [!NOTE]
> When a software change is made on a Windows, Linux, or macOS device, it typically takes 2-4 hours for the data to be reflected in the security portal. It can take up to 8 hours for changes on iOS and Android devices to be reflected. There may be situations where it takes longer.

Configuration changes can take anywhere from 4 to 24 hours.

### Investigate changes in device exposure or effect

If there's a large jump in the number of exposed devices, or a sharp increase in the effect on an organization's exposure score and Microsoft Secure Score for Devices, then that security recommendation is worth investigating.

1.  Select the recommendation and **Open software** page.
2.  Select the **Event timeline** tab to view all the impactful events related to that software. For example, new vulnerabilities or new public exploits. For more information, see [Learn more about event timeline](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/threat-and-vuln-mgt-event-timeline?azure-portal=true).
3.  Decide how to address the increase or your organization's exposure. For example, submitting a remediation request.

### Request remediation

The threat and vulnerability management remediation capability bridges the gap between Security and IT administrators through the remediation request workflow. Security admins like you can request for the IT Administrator to remediate a vulnerability from the Security recommendation page to Intune.

Select a security recommendation you would like to request remediation for, and then select **Remediation options.** Fill out the form and select **Submit request**. Go to the **Remediation** page to view the status of your remediation request.

**Additional reading**. For more information, see [Learn more about how to request remediation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-remediation?azure-portal=true).

### File for exception

As an alternative to a remediation request when a recommendation isn't relevant at the moment, you can create exceptions for recommendations. Only users with "exceptions handling" permissions can add exception.

When an exception is created for a recommendation, the recommendation is no longer active. The recommendation state will change to Full exception or Partial exception (by device group).

**Additional reading**. For more information, see [Learn more about exceptions](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-exception?azure-portal=true).

To create an exception, select a security recommendation you would like to create an exception for, and then select **Exception options**.

:::image type="content" source="../media/exception-options-f1579074.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the exception options button in the security recommendation flyout.":::


Fill out the form and then submit it. To view all your exceptions (current and past), navigate to the **Remediation** page under the **Threat and Vulnerability Management** menu. Then select the **Exceptions** tab.

**Additional reading**. For more information, see [Learn more about how to create an exception](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-exception?azure-portal=true).

### Report an inaccurate recommendation

You can report a false positive when you see any vague, inaccurate, incomplete, or already remediated security recommendation information.

1.  Open the **Security recommendation** page.
2.  Select the ellipsis icon (three dots) beside the security recommendation that you want to report, and then select **Report inaccuracy**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/report-inaccuracy-button-73e376c5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Report inaccuracy button.":::
    
3.  On the detail pane that appears, select the **Inaccuracy** category from the drop-down menu. Then enter your email address and the details regarding the inaccuracy.
4.  Select **Submit**. Your feedback is immediately sent to the threat and vulnerability management experts.
