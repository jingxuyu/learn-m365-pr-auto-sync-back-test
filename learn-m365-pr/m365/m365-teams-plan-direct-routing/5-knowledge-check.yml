      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A hosted SBC solution is suitable for organizations that either do not have in-house skills or would prefer to delegate the management of the service to a specialist vendor."
    - content: Microsoft doesn't recommend hosted SBC solutions.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft certifies SBCs, but doesn't have a certification program for partner organizations that offer SBC solutions."
    - content: You're responsible for SBC updates with a hosted solution.

  - content: "What is the purpose of a tenant dial plan?"
    choices:
    - content: A tenant dial plan allows Teams users to make calls outside the organization.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. It isn't necessary to configure a dial plan for users to make calls outside the organization."
    - content: A tenant dial plan allows users to keep legacy dialing patterns, such as three-digit extension numbers.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A tenant dial plan uses normalization rules to convert a familiar dialing pattern to the international E.164 dialing standard."
    - content: A tenant dial plan restricts users from making international calls.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A tenant dial plan doesn't limit the class of call that a user can make. That's done with a PSTN usage record."
  - content: "What's the difference between a Downstream SBC and a Proxy SBC, when configuring local media optimization?"
    choices:
    - content: The Downstream SBC doesn't need an IP address.
      isCorrect: false

    - content: The Downstream SBC doesn't have a public IP address.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When paired with a Proxy SBC, the Downstream SBC doesn't have a public IP address."
    - content: The Proxy SBC doesn't have a public IP address.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When paired with a Downstream SBC, the Downstream SBC must have a public IP address."

    - content: You should only configure a voice routing policy to stop media being sent via the internet and Phone Service for users in the same building or on the same network.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A voice routing policy is required for all users making calls with Direct Routing, not only users in the same building or on the same network."
    - content: You should only configure a voice routing policy to stop users from making international calls.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A voice routing policy is required in more scenarios than restricting the class of call a user is allowed to make."
    - content: You configure a voice routing policy for all scenarios with Direct Routing.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A voice routing policy is required for users to make calls in all scenarios using Direct Routing."
