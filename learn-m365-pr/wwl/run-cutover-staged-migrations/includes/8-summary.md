Cutover and staged migrations are useful options when an organization plans to migrate mailboxes from its on-premises Exchange Servers to Exchange Online.

To support these migration options, this module examined how to plan and complete both a cutover and staged migration. You learned about the requirements, planning activities, and migration process for each option.

For example, you learned that organizations that have Exchange Server 2007 or later and fewer than 2000 users can implement a cutover Exchange migration. A cutover migration is an all-or-nothing approach where you migrate the entire Exchange organization in one step.

This module also compared cutover and staged migrations. While cutover migrations migrate all your user mailboxes in one step, staged migrations migrate mailboxes in batches (up to 2,000 mailboxes per batch) to Microsoft 365. By doing so, a staged migration moves some mailboxes to Exchange Online while maintaining the rest of the mailboxes in the on-premises mail environment. You also learned that a staged migration can only be run in Exchange 2003 and 2007 environments. Staged migrations aren't supported in organizations running Exchange 2010 or later.
