Encryption is the process of encoding information in a way that only authorized parties can read it. Using encryption protects data against theft, failures in physical security, and eavesdropping on data in transit. Most encryption methods use one or more keys. These keys provide the ability to read data that has been made unintelligible by encryption. Keys can be used to encrypt data, decrypt data, or both. When a key is the means of decrypting data, the ability to use that key means that you are an authorized party.

Encryption is an important part of the Microsoft data protection strategy and provides one layer of our Defense-In-Depth approach to security. Encryption contributes to data security and data privacy by providing an additional layer of defense against unauthorized disclosure of data. Encryption can also help meet compliance obligations or internal requirements to protect the confidentiality of sensitive or otherwise protected data.

Encrypting information renders it unreadable to unauthorized persons who manage to bypass other security controls. Even if an adversary was able to break through firewalls, infiltrate the network, obtain physical access to devices, or bypass permissions on a local machine, the data in our systems would remain protected by strong encryption. For any malicious attacker who obtained encrypted data without the key that can decrypt the data, the data would be unreadable.

## Overview of Microsoft 365 encryption

With Microsoft 365, multiple layers and kinds of encryption work together to secure your data at rest and in transit.

**Examples of data-at-rest** include files that you've uploaded to a SharePoint library, Project Online data, documents that you've uploaded in Microsoft Teams meetings, email messages and attachments that you've stored in folders in your mailbox, and files you've uploaded to OneDrive for Business.

**Examples of data-in-transit** include mail messages that are in the process of being delivered, or conversations that are taking place in an online meeting. In Microsoft 365, data is in transit whenever a user's device is communicating with a Microsoft server, or when a Microsoft server is communicating with another server.

Customer data is encrypted at rest and in transit using FIPS 140-2 compatible encryption algorithms and technologies, including BitLocker, service encryption, Transport Layer Security (TLS), Internet Protocol Security (IPSec), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms. In addition, Microsoft employs advanced key management solutions to ensure that encryption keys are properly secured.
