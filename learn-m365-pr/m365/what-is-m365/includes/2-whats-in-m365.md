Some Microsoft 365 components, like Office 365 and Intune, are delivered using the **Software as a Service (SaaS)** model. SaaS is software thatâ€™s centrally hosted and managed by a **cloud service provider (CSP)** for customers. In general, CSPs provide one version of an app for all customers and license it through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are examples of SaaS.
