    choices:
    - content: "Domain controllers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The sign-in process authenticates both the computer and user accounts. In an AD DS environment, domain controllers perform authentication for computer accounts during the startup process and for user accounts when the user signs in."
    - content: "LDAP calls"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. LDAP calls are used to query and manage AD DS. Try again."
    - content: "Group policy objects"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings. Try again."
  - content: "What does AD DS use for locating resources such as domain controllers?"
    choices:
    - content: "Domain Name System"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. AD DS uses Domain Name System (DNS) for locating resources such as domain controllers."
    - content: "LDAP"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) provides a mechanism for connecting to, searching, and modifying Internet directories. Try again."
    - content: "Kerberos"

      explanation: "Incorrect. Kerberos is the protocol used by AD DS for authentication. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for World Wide Importers, Patti Fernandez deployed AD DS on an Azure virtual machine to enable scalability and availability for an on-premises AD DS. What's one of the repercussions of deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine?"
    choices:
    - content: "Authentication will be very slow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't a drawback of deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine. Try again."
    - content: "You can't use drive C for AD DS storage"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. It's not that you can't use drive C for AD DS storage, but you shouldn't. Instead, you should deploy one or more additional Azure data disks to store the AD DS database, logs ,and SYSVOL. Try again."
    - content: "It doesn't make any use of Azure AD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. You can deploy AD DS on an Azure virtual machine to enable scalability and availability for an on-premises AD DS. However, deploying AD DS on an Azure virtual machine doesn't make any use of Azure AD."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson recently deployed several new Windows 11 computers. George, who was a recipient of one of those new computers, complained to Holly that he was unable to access the local computer or network resources. Which of the following items could be causing the authentication failures that George has been experiencing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Holly didn't properly configure the list of DNS servers on George's computer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If you don't properly configure the list of DNS servers on a Windows client computer, it can't obtain a list of domain controllers. This will result in authentication failures, in which case the user can't access the local computer or network resources."
    - content: "George didn't reauthenticate his user account by restarting the computer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This step doesn't apply to this scenario. It's only needed if George's computer had been added to a group. Restarting the computer would be necessary to reauthenticate the account to update the security token with group membership. Try again."
    - content: "Holly didn't assign George to an Active Directory security group"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item wouldn't be causing the problem George is experiencing. Try again."
