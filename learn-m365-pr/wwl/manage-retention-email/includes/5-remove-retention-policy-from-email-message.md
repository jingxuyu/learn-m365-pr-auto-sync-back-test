When you remove a retention policy from an email message, the folder policy will apply to the item, if one is assigned.

Users can complete the following steps to remove a retention policy in Outlook:

1.  In the message list, select a message. To select more than one message, press and hold the CTRL key as you select each message.
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Tags** group, select **Assign Policy**.<br><br>:::image type="content" source="../media/outlook-use-folder-policy-b2e1d5bc.png" alt-text="screenshot of the Assign Policy menu when selected on the Outlook ribbon":::
    <br><br>
3.  Under **Retention Policy**, select **Use Folder Policy**.

The retention policy for a message appears in the header in the Reading Pane under the recipient names. The retention policy includes the expiration date. If no retention policy is applied, no information appears under the message recipient names.
