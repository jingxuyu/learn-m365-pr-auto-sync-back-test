Microsoft 365 enables communication and collaboration across different teams within an organization. However, sometimes it's necessary to restrict these services so they don't create a conflict for the organization. These scenarios often include conflict of interest situations where the information shared could interfere with business ethics or business practices. Microsoft 365 addresses this situation by enabling organizations to create information barriers.

This module examines how Information barriers enable administrators to restrict communication and collaboration between certain teams to safeguard the internal information. Information barriers are policies designed to prevent certain segments of users from communicating with each other. They also allow specific segments to communicate only with certain other segments. Information barrier policies can help your organization maintain compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, and avoid potential conflicts of interest.

For example, suppose an administrator has been told to limit collaboration between the Day Trader team and the Marketing team. The administrator can create an information barrier to prohibit file sharing and prevent communication between the two groups within Microsoft Teams.

This module explores the components of information barriers. Particular focus is paid to understanding how information barrier modes strengthen who can be added to or removed from a Team, OneDrive account, and SharePoint site.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how information barriers can restrict or allow communication and collaboration among specific groups of users.
 -  Describe the components of an information barrier and how to enable information barriers.
 -  Understand how information barrier modes help strengthen who can be added or removed from a Microsoft Team, OneDrive account, and SharePoint site.
 -  Describe how information barriers prevent users or groups from communicating and collaborating in Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
