During your add-in development, you need to verify functionality and fix issues. As you debug your add-in, developer tools are available for you to use.

## Host your add-in on a web server

As you develop and test your add-in, you can use a tool like the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins to host it on your development machine. To make your add-in accessible to other users, you need to host it on a web server, either your own or through a service like Azure.

## Test and debug your add-in

As mentioned previously, you'll likely need to debug your add-in to figure out why it's not behaving as expected. Ensure your add-in works properly on platforms and Office application versions that your users are on.

Depending on your needs, you can take advantage of the Office 365 Developer Program that provides you with an Office 365 tenant for your testing.
