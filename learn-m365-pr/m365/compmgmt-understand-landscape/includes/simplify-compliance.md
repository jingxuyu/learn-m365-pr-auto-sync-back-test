Compliance management is fundamentally about simplifying risk assessment and mitigation, providing visibility and insights to help you meet compliance requirements. Microsoft Compliance Manager is the end-to-end compliance management solution included in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. It helps organizations simplify compliance, reduce risk, and meet global, industry, or regional compliance regulations and standards. Compliance Manager translates complicated regulations, standards, company policies, or other desired control frameworks into simple language, maps regulatory controls to recommended improvement actions, and provides step-by-step guidance on how to implement those actions to meet regulatory requirements. Compliance Manager helps customers prioritize work by associating a score with each action, which accrues to an overall compliance score.

Even if you are not an expert in complex regulations or standards like GDPR, ISO 27001 or NIST 800-53, you can quickly identify the actions recommended to help you achieve compliance. With Compliance Manager, you do not need to be familiar with regulations and standards to help improve your organization's compliance posture.

Compliance Manager can help you throughout your compliance journey including taking inventory of your data protection risks, managing the complexities of implementing controls, staying current with regulations and certifications, and reporting to auditors.

Compliance Manager provides the following benefits:

- Pre-built assessments for common industry and regional standards and regulations, and custom assessments to meet your unique compliance needs. Available assessments depend on your licensing agreement.
- Workflow functionality to help you efficiently complete risk assessments.
- Detailed guidance on actions you can take to improve your level of compliance with the standards and regulations most relevant for your organization.
- Risk-based compliance score to help you understand your compliance posture by measuring your progress completing improvement actions.
