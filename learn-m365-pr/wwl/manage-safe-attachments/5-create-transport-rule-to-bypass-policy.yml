      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what Holly should do to implement this business requirement. Try again."
    - content: "Create a transport rule and don't select the \"Redirect attachment on detection\" option"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what Holly should do to implement this business requirement. Try again."
    - content: "Create a transport rule that bypasses Safe Attachments scanning"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If an organization wants to implement a policy to allow mail with attachments to flow without delay from internal senders, it can create a mail flow rule in the Exchange admin center. The purpose of this rule would be to bypass Safe Attachments scanning."
