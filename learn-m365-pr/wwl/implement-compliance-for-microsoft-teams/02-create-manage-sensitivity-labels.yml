  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is creating a sensitivity label. When defining the scope for the label, Holly configured the label settings. What else can Holly define as part of the label's scope?"

    - content: "A help link to a custom help page"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Choose which users and groups see the label"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the second part of the label's scope. Try again."
