Next up â€“ the presenter. Part of your role on the virtual summit event team is training your presenters. Learn about pre-event best practices and what tools can help them present with ease and optimize their digital content.

## Optimize your content for digital delivery

Connecting with an audience and being able to present with ease are important skills to develop, especially for virtual events. Your audience is most likely at home watching you on a small screen. Virtual event sessions are much more intimate and on-demand now. Speak with energy and use your normal tone of voice, as if you're holding a conversation with close colleagues. Remember to engage the attendees by looking into the camera when you can. Keeping your content tight, focused, and trying not to repeat yourself also helps the audience stay engaged.

Also, try these techniques:

- Identify your central message and mention it in both the introduction and the summary.
- Have a clear call to action within your presentation.
- Use a mix of text, and images in your presentation.
- Don't read your slides to the audience. Use a bullet point format and add value with your expertise.
- Rehearse timing to ensure you can adequately cover your content in the time provided.
- Place housekeeping and resource slides at the beginning of the presentation, so you don't disrupt question and answer sessions at the end of the meeting.
- Check how materials will be shared with participants at the end of the meeting.
- If using PowerPoint, review settings under the **Slide Show** menu to customize your defaults.

You can also use the PowerPoint Presenter Coach to evaluate your presentation delivery. Presenter Coach lets you enter a rehearsal mode and analyzes your performance using AI assistance. The Coach can give feedback on:

- Pacing.
- Inclusive language and culturally insensitive phrases.
- Filler words, such as "Um" and "Er", which can be distracting.

After your practice, the Coach provides a detailed report that you can use to improve your technique.

## Set up your equipment and environment

Before you present a virtual event, you need to set up your tools and space. Presenters should have the following hardware for meetings:

- **External microphone**: Audio is the most important portion of your presentation. You should plan to have a microphone that is external to your 
computer. Avoid using laptop speakers/microphones for the best audio.
- **Web Camera**: Select a web camera that delivers a minimum 720p (ideally 1080p) resolution. Position your camera at or slightly above eye level.
- **Lighting**: If you'll be presenting frequently, consider getting a stand-alone LED light to provide a higher-quality image on video. Avoid sitting where there is heavy backlighting.
- **Test it!** Ask for a rehearsal or schedule your own live event or Teams meeting to test your equipment. Use the test call feature in Microsoft Teams to record a voicemail that will play back to you so you can hear your own voice.

For the best quality, review the recommended device options at [https://aka.ms/TeamsDevices](https://aka.ms/TeamsDevices).

> [!TIP]
> If you can, use at least two monitors during meetings. You can share the screen from one monitor and use the other monitor to keep notes, the Teams window, and other applications visible to you without distracting other participants.

Presenters also need to set up the space around them. Consider the following changes to your environment before your virtual event.

- Find a relatively quiet location with a good quality microphone.
- Use a comfortable seating or standing arrangement. Make sure your setup doesn't introduce other noises (like a squeaky chair or a loud ceiling fan).
- If you share space with others, consider putting a sign on your office door, letting those around you know when you are presenting or recording. This can help minimize interruptions while you're working.

### Checklist: Presenting and recording from home

Nothing is worse during a virtual event than connection issues or distracted presenters. The day of the event, run through these checklists to make sure you're ready to present.

|Ready? |Computer|
|-|-|
| |Plug into a power outlet. (Don't rely on battery power.)|
| |Connect to a wired network, if one's available. Don't rely on your wireless network.|
| |Save a copy of your presentation material locally. (In case you have access issues to a shared location.)|
| |Clean up your desktop - remove any unnecessary icons, hide your taskbar.|
| |Install the latest version of your browser (Edge or Chrome).|
| |Clear your browser history (or use a new profile).|
| |Turn off notifications.|
| |Check for updates before the presentation or disable automatic updates.|

|Ready? |Environment|
|-|-|
| |Record in a private room or a space without distractions.|
| |Make sure there's no harsh light behind you. Use a warm light instead, like a desk lamp.|
| |Clean up the physical space around you.|
| |Turn off or silence your mobile devices.|
| |Use a natural, uncluttered backdrop, or use Teams background effects.|
| |Choose your clothing with care - wear a solid color or a subtle pattern. |
| |Avoid busy patterns, all white, or grass-green (especially if your producer is using green screen effects).|

## Use the presentation tools

When it's time to present, join the event from the invitation in Outlook or your Teams calendar. It's a good idea to make a note of the phone number and conference ID in the meeting invite so that you can dial into the meeting in case there is a connection loss.

:::image type="content" source="../media/join-meeting.png" alt-text="After you open an invitation, select Join Now to join the meeting.":::

> [!NOTE]
>You can only present in a live event from your Windows or Mac computer. Currently, presenting from a mobile device is not supported.

Once you are on the Teams call, turn on your microphone and camera, and share your desktop or presentation.

:::image type="content" source="../media/presentation-tools.png" alt-text="In the meeting, there are tools to enable your camera or microphone and to share your desktop.":::

If you're sharing your desktop, make sure the following items are hidden out of the way on a second monitor or minimized:

- The Teams panel.
- The Teams meeting chat window. It's best to have the meeting chat on another monitor so that you can keep an eye on it for any communication from moderators, producers, or switching operations during your session.
- Meeting notes and other apps that you need to use but don't want the attendees to see.

During the event, a red border indicates the presenter whose camera is enabled and shared.

:::image type="content" source="../media/live-event-presenters-view.png" alt-text="In a live event presenter's view, a red border indicates the presenter whose camera in enabled and shared.":::

In a Teams meeting, your most important tools are:

- **Share screen.** Share either an entire desktop, a specific application window, a PowerPoint presentation, or a whiteboard to draw on.
- **Show meeting chat.** Display and respond to messages.
- **Show participants.** Check who is present.
- **Start recording.** Record the video and audio from a meeting. The Start recording button is in the More Actions menu. Recordings are helpful for participants to review on-demand after the scheduled event. You can access the recording in the meeting chat after the meeting ends.

In a Teams Live Event, you have some extra tools available during the meeting:

- **Enable chat private.** Chat only with the event producers and moderators. Attendees don't see these messages.
- **Moderate the attendees' Q&A.** Questions from attendees can be published to the entire audience, or they can be answered privately. You can also dismiss any redundant or out-of-context questions.
