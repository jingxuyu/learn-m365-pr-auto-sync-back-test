Now that you're familiar with the software navigation, let's jump into the 4Cs, starting with **Cascade**. Viva Goals gives a visual display of the alignment of **Objective**, **Key Results** and **Projects** which shows how OKRs cascade from one level to the next, allowing all employees and teams to see how their work directly contributes to the ultimate goals of your organization.

The transparency of being able to see how OKRs relate to each other also allows bottlenecks or duplication of efforts to be identified.

The alignment of OKRs is best visualized in the main screen section. Next to an **Objective** you'll see a dropdown arrow.

1. Select this dropdown arrow **(1)** to display the **Objectives** and **Key Results** that are aligned to the original **Objective**.
1. A **Key Result** may have a dropdown arrow next to it. Selecting this will display any **Projects** that are aligned to the **Key Result**.
1. Cascading can also be visualized using the **View Chart (2)** feature, located under the "View Options."
1. Each **Objective**, **Key Result**, and **Project** also has an **Alignment** section that will display Cascading OKRs. This can be viewed by selecting the relevant **Objective**, **Key Result**, or **Project title (3).**
