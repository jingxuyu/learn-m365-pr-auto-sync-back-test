Learn about the Microsoft security capabilities that help keep your applications and data secure in your Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) deployment.

## Scenario

You are the lead system engineer and Microsoft Azure administrator at Contoso, Ltd., which is a growing financial services company that is based in London and has a branch office in New York. The company uses Microsoft 365 and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). These services are in sync with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with the use of Azure AD Connect.

The IT director has asked you to evaluate the risks and benefits to using WVD to support their remote workers. The key aspects of the evaluation will be functionality, scalability, security, and the cost of WVD.

In this module, you’ll learn how to access WVD from the Azure portal and configure WVD services that are configured in a shared responsibility model.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to explain the requirements and architecture for a WVD deployment and assess its security.
