  questions:
  - content: "The Consent Framework is built on what type of authentication?"
    choices:
    - content: "NTLM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Consent Framework isn't built on this type of authentication."
    - content: "Oauth 2.0"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The consent framework is built on OAuth 2.0 and its various flows, such as authorization code grant and client credentials grant, using public or confidential clients. By using OAuth 2.0, Azure AD makes it possible to build many different types of client applications."
    - content: "Kerberos"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Consent Framework isn't built on this type of authentication."
  - content: "A user has added a new application. The application’s permissions have been updated, the application is running, and the user is about to use it for the first time. What does the application need to obtain from Azure AD’s /authorize endpoint before the user can access the application?"
    choices:
    - content: "Security token"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't what the application needs to obtain from Azure AD’s /authorize endpoint before the user can access the application."
    - content: "Endpoint authorization"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't what the application needs to obtain from Azure AD’s /authorize endpoint before the user can access the application."
    - content: "Authorization Code"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The application must obtain an authorization code from Azure AD’s /authorize endpoint. The authorization code can then be used to acquire a new access and refresh token, which enables the user to access the application."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, Holly Spencer contracted with an ISV to create a multi-tenant application. Holly's goal is to make the app available to Tailspin's customers and partners. Holly updated the application registration in the Azure portal so that it supports multi-tenancy. What's the next step that must be completed so that users from Tailspin's customers and partners can access the application?"
    choices:
    - content: "A user or administrator in other organizations must grant their users the ability to sign in to this application"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Multi-tenant applications must be provisioned in each tenant where users need access. A user from another tenant must grant the application access to resources secured by the user's tenant. This experience is referred to as \"user consent.\""
    - content: "Holly must remove the application's service principal through the Azure portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This step removes a multi-tenant application authorized by another organization."
    - content: "Holly must assign the App ID URL a host name that matches a verified domain of Tailspin's Azure AD tenant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This step is actually part of the provisioning process when you updated the application registration in the Azure portal so that the app supports multi-tenancy. Registering the app for multi-tenancy would have failed if the App ID URL was not configured correctly."
