This module provides insight into how to implement your domain services, and specifically how to add custom domains into Microsoft 365. Your company may need multiple domain names for different purposes. For example, you may want to add a different spelling of your company name because customers are already using it and their communications have failed to reach you. Custom domains allow companies to have their own branding on emails and accounts so that customers can verify who is emailing them (for example, @contoso.com).

In this module, you'll examine what considerations need to be addressed when planning for a new domain in Microsoft 365, including the domain's DNS requirements. You'll then review the steps to be taken to add and set up a new domain.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 *  Identify the factors that must be considered when adding a custom domain to Microsoft 365
 *  Plan the DNS zones used in a custom domain
 *  Plan the DNS record requirements for a custom domain
 *  Add a custom domain to your Microsoft 365 deployment
