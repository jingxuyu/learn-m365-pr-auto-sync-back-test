    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "What are two of the most common phishing attacks made on an organization?"
      choices:
      - content: "Distributed denial of service (DDoS) and spam"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "DDoS is a denial of service attack that targets an organization's infrastructure and isn't considered phishing. Spam mail may be malicious in intent but isn't always an attack."
      - content: "Malicious attachments and DDoS"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Malicious attachments are a common way to attack an organization's end-user base. DDoS is a denial of service attack that targets an organization's infrastructure and isn't considered phishing."
      - content: "Spam and malicious hyperlinks"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Spam mail may be malicious in intent but isn't always an attack. Malicious hyperlinks are a common way to attack an organization's end-user base."
      - content: "Malicious attachments and hyperlinks"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Malicious attachments and hyperlinks are two of the most common phishing attacks. Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protects against both with Safe Links and Safe Attachments."
    - content: "The Contoso organization has Office 365 Enterprise E5 for all users. The security administrator has defined specific anti-phishing policies for the finance department but hasn't applied those policies elsewhere. Which of the following is true?"
      choices:
      - content: "Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing protection is in place for all of Contoso"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Although the feature is available, at least one Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policy must be defined for the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 machine learning models to work."
      - content: "Microsoft Defender for Office 365 advanced anti-phishing protection is in place for finance, while all other Contoso users receive baseline anti-phishing protection."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "There is no baseline and advanced layer of Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing protection."
      - content: "Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing protection is in place for finance and all newly created users, but not for the rest of Contoso."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Although the feature is available, at least one Microsoft Defender for Office 365 policy must be defined for the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 machine learning models to work. New users would only receive the policy if placed in the finance department."
      - content: "Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing protection is in place for only the finance department."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Since the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policies were only applied to the finance department, the rest of Contoso won't receive that protection until the policies are applied to the organization."
      
    - content: "What anti-phishing policy option should be used to ensure an outside attacker canâ€™t impersonate the CEO of your organization?"
      choices:
      - content: "Add impersonation policy"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This isn't a configurable Microsoft Defender for Office 365 anti-phishing policy option."
      - content: "Add users to protect"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. This ensures that mail from outside your organization isn't an impersonation of one of the users on the protected list of users. The protected users list is different from the list of people to which the policy is enforced, which is set in the 'Applied to' section of the policy options."
      - content: "Add trusted senders and domains"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This defines email addresses and domains that will not be considered impersonation. Messages from the sender email addresses and domains you add as trusted senders and domains won't ever be classified as an impersonation-based attack. This wouldn't specifically protect your CEO but is a good policy to enable."
      - content: "Add domains to protect"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This would ensure that mail from outside your organization isn't an impersonation of one of the domains defined in your list of verified domains or that of a partner domain. It could be used in conjunction with 'add users to protect' but wouldn't specifically target protecting your CEO."
