In this interactive guide, you will learn about several different servicing options for Windows 10.

You will see how to deploy Windows 10 upgrades using task sequences, and automated servicing plans in System Center Configuration Manager. You will also see how to use Microsoft Intune to manage Windows 10 updates on all your devices.

You can create a task sequence in Configuration Manager to automatically upgrade an operating system on a destination computer, such as from Windows 7 to Windows 10. This method allows you to keep the applications, settings and all the user data on the computer.

Using Microsoft Intune, you can manage your Windows updates. This includes viewing information about the update, approving or declining the update, and viewing the computers that will install the update when if it is approved.

Follow the interactive guide to see how to:
