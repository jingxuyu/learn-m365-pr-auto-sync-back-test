       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Virtualize desktops and apps by using Azure Virtual Desktop."
   - content: "What's one of the primary reasons to use Autoscale"
     choices:
     - content: "To increase virtual disk storage when users get close to reaching the limits in a VM."
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. Automated scaling is used to provision and deprovision VMs to save costs based on user demands or usage patterns. Vertically scaling VM size is possible but not the primary reason for autoscaling."
     - content: "To increase service uptime and availability"
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. VM availability sets are used to help ensure service uptime and availability. Automated scaling is used to provision and deprovision VMs to save costs based on user demands or usage patterns."
     - content: "To save costs by matching the number of running VMs to user demand"
       isCorrect: true
       explanation: "Correct. Automated scaling is used to provision and deprovision virtual machines in order to save costs based on user demands or usage patterns. The automation can be based on a schedule to match common business hours or actual resource utilization."
