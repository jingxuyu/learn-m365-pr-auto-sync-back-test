You can use Microsoft Teams Direct Routing to integrate with your existing telephony infrastructure and receive or make calls through public switched telephone networks (PSTNs).

Suppose you're the lead administrator for Microsoft Teams at a clothing retailer. You have around 3,000 users and a hardware-based voice-over IP system for all telephony on-premises. You've recently rolled out Microsoft Teams and you're using it for collaboration and video conferencing. You've been asked to investigate how Direct Routing could replace your organization's existing phone system. You've already outlined a plan to implement Direct Routing across your organization. Now you want to start configuring and managing Direct Routing for your users.

In this module, you'll learn how administrators configure Direct Routing to meet users' needs for telephony through a PSTN.
