Storage Spaces can simplify your storage administration and allow for easy storage growth. In most enterprises, servers will be the only computers using Storage Spaces. Small offices might use Storage Spaces in Windows to create high capacity and storage that is easy to administer.

#### Thin provisioning storage

The need for storage is always growing. Smaller companies without IT staff might find it difficult to add new storage to their solutions today. Storage Spaces can help with storage growth when you use thin provisioning. Thin provisioning will allow you to create a bigger storage space than what the disks will be able to store. You then add the disks to the storage space when you need more storage, and the storage space will automatically claim the space on the disks.

#### Reliable storage

Small businesses often do not have the funds for acquiring enterprise-grade storage solutions. Storage Spaces can help these companies get fault-tolerant storage for an affordable price. Storage Spaces has two resiliency types that provide fault tolerance. These will help to make the storage highly available in case of disk failures. Two-way mirror and parity can function even when one drive fails. Three-way mirror can function with two drive failures.

#### High-performance storage

Users who have computing needs with high-performance storage, such as video editing, might also benefit from Storage Spaces. When you create a storage space with parity resilience, the striping will give a better performance reading and writing to the storage. When you use SSDs as the physical drives, you should be able to get the required disk I/O.
