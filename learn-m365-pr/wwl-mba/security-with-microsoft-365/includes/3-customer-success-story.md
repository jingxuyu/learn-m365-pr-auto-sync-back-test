BP PLC, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, is responsible for a vast network that must be defended from cyberattacks twenty-four hours a day, every day. Due to their international size and scale, BP has a network that covers dozens of disciplines and hundreds of markets-that's a large surface for threats, both internal and external. By moving to Microsoft 365, BP was able to move a significant portion of on-premises IT to the cloud, ensuring infrastructure security with Azure. With Microsoft 365, BP was able to tighten the integration of components and reduce complexity at the same time.

As you saw in the video, BP's goal of simplifying security became a reality when they adopted Microsoft 365. They now get alerts of potential threats and can view a comprehensive picture of potential cyberattacks across all devices, users, and applications. Microsoft 365 has also allowed BP to reduce integration cost and complexity and free up time for IT to focus on higher-order work.

Now that you've seen an example of Microsoft 365 security in action, let's see what actions you can take to assess your security needs.
