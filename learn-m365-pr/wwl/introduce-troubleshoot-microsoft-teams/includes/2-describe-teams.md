For many years, Microsoft has provided organizations with real-time communications and conferencing with their line-of-communication server products. But now, cloud computing has become the catalyst for the most recent evolution in the product. Today, Microsoft Teams provides a broad set of communication and collaboration features as part of Microsoft 365. 

## What is Teams?

Teams is the central collaboration workspace in Microsoft 365. You can use Teams to:

- Make audio and video calls
- Manage meetings and private messages
- Collaborate through team chats

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Teams provides enhanced security features and standards compliance to help ensure that your organization’s most sensitive collaborations are private.

- Schedule and join online meetings with or without high-definition (HD) video
- Manage Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls
- Manage dial-in audio conferencing options
- Share your files, apps, or desktop interface for online meetings

Teams provides a central hub for collaboration. Within team workspaces, you can find content, tools, people, and conversations. 

You can use the following Microsoft 365 elements to enhance Teams functionality:

- Microsoft SharePoint Online
- Microsoft OneNote
- Office 365 groups

> [!NOTE]
> Teams provides enterprise security and compliance features that help keep data encrypted both at rest and in transit.

Teams interacts with the following online services:

- Microsoft Exchange Online
- SharePoint Online
- Microsoft OneDrive for Business

> [!TIP]
> To access the full Teams experience, you should enable every user for Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Office 365 group creation.


## Architecture

The Teams architecture is comprised of two components, described in the following table. 

| **Component** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Teams         | A *team* is a group of people working  on a project. Each team consists of Team owners and Team members. Within  Teams, team owners can: add owners and members; rename or delete teams;  manage team settings; and set moderation settings. |
| Channels      | Channels are  the key to organizing team collaboration. Channels can cover different topics  within a team and are open to everyone on the team. When you create a team, a  default channel named General is created. |


> [!TIP]
> Each generated team also generates an Office 365 group.


> [!TIP]
> Team members can add additional channels to the team. 

## Licensing

Teams is not offered as a standalone plan. It combines services from Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business.
