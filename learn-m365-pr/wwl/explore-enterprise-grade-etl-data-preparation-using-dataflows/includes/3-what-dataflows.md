A **dataflow** is a collection of entities (entities are similar to tables) that are created and managed in workspaces in the Power BI service. As data volume continues to grow, so does the challenge of wrangling that data into well-formed, actionable information. We want data thatâ€™s ready for analytics, to populate visuals, reports, and dashboards, so we can quickly turn our volumes of data into actionable insights. With self-service data prep for big data in Power BI, you can go from data to Power BI insights with just a few clicks with dataflows.
