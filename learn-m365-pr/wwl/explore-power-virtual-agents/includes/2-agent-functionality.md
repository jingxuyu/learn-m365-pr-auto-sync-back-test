 *  COVID-19 infection rate and tracking information
 *  Sales help and support issues
 *  Opening hours and store information
 *  Employee health and vacation benefits
 *  Common employee questions for businesses

### Benefits of Power Virtual Agents

Power Virtual Agents enables teams to easily create powerful bots using a guided, no-code graphical interface. Power Virtual Agents addresses the following issues with bot building in the industry today:

 *  It eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the long latency between teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it.
 *  It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code.
 *  It minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

Power Virtual Agents can:

 *  **Simplify bot building.** Virtual agents enable teams to easily build bots without needing intermediaries, or coding, or AI expertise.
 *  **Reduce costs.** Virtual agents easily automate common inquiries. This feature frees up users to deal with more complex issues.

### Key features of Power Virtual Agents

Key features of Power Virtual Agents include:

 *  **Get started in seconds**. Power Virtual Agents is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. It allows users to easily sign up, create a bot, and embed it into a website with just a few clicks. There's no infrastructure to maintain or complex system to deploy.
 *  **Enable your subject matter experts**. By using Power Virtual Agents, business SMEs can create bots quickly and easily using a novel, intuitive, code-free graphical interface, eliminating the need for AI expertise or teams of developers.
 *  **Enable rich, natural conversations.** Microsoft’s powerful conversational AI capabilities enable end users to have rich, multi-turn conversations that quickly guide them to the right solution. Unlike most products on the market, there's no need to retrain AI models. Users creating the bot begin by providing a few short examples of the topic they want the bot to handle. Once they build the conversation using Microsoft’s graphical editor, the bot is ready to handle customer requests. Users creating the bot can even test their changes in real time using the Test pane.
 *  **Enable bots to take action.** Bots that can chat with your users are great, but bots that can act on their behalf are even better. With Power Virtual Agents, users creating the bot can easily integrate with services and back-end systems without having to configure the integration. They can also integrate with hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using Power Automate. This process makes it simple to create a bot that not only responds to the user, but also takes action on their behalf.
 *  **Monitor and improve bot performance.** Power Virtual Agents lets bot creators keep an eye on how their bots are performing using powerful metrics and AI-driven dashboards. They can easily see which topics are doing well and where the bot can be improved, and then quickly make adjustments to improve performance.
