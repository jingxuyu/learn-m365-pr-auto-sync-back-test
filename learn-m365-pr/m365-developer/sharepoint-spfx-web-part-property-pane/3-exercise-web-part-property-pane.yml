quiz:
  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What's required to automatically update a property mapped to a property pane control when a user updates the value?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implement the `autoUpdateWebPartProperties` overridable property on the `BaseClientSideWebPart` class to return `true`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "There's no property `autoUpdateWebPartProperties` on the `BaseClientSideWebPart` class."
    - content: "Implement the `disableReactivePropertyChanges` overridable property on the `BaseClientSideWebPart` class to return `false`."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `disableReactivePropertyChanges` property already returns `false` by default, unless its overridden."
    - content: "Nothing - the default reactive mode of the property pane automatically updates properties when they're changed in the property pane."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
  - content: "Which of the following best explains the difference between the two modes of a property pane: reactive and non-reactive?"
    choices:
    - content: "The reactive mode means mapped web part properties are automatically updated when they're changed in a property pane control, while non-reactive means the user must select the **Apply** button to save their changes."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The property pane must be set to reactive when the React web framework is used in the web part. If a different or no web framework is used by the web part, set the mode to non-reactive."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The reactive mode of a property pane has nothing to do with web frameworks."
