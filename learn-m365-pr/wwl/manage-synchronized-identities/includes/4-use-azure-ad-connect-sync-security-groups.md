During setup, Azure AD Connect automatically creates Azure AD Connect Sync Security Groups. A Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator can use these groups to:

 *  delegate control in Azure AD Connect to other users
 *  assign a user temporary permission to run a manual synchronization
 *  troubleshoot directory synchronization issues using Azure AD Connect

The following table identifies the Azure AD Connect Sync Security Groups that are automatically created by Azure AD Connect.

The groups are either created as local groups on domain-joined servers, or as Active Directory domain groups when Azure AD Connect is installed on a domain controller. To create domain groups on member servers, you must select the **Specify Custom Sync Groups** option during setup and specify the groups by Domain\\Group Name.
