In this exercise, you’ll update the existing Teams app to send a proactive message from your bot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This exercise assumes you have created the Microsoft Teams app project with the Yeoman generator that contains a personal tab from the previous exercise in this module. You'll update the project to add a new task module that uses an Adaptive Card.

## Start a proactive message from the bot

Locate and open the bot in the file **./src/app/conversationalBot/ConversationalBot.ts**.

Add the following objects to the existing `import {...} from "botbuilder";` statement you'll need:

```typescript
import {
  ChannelInfo,
  TeamsChannelData,
  ConversationParameters,
  teamsGetChannelId,
  Activity,
  BotFrameworkAdapter,
  ConversationReference,
  ConversationResourceResponse,
  // existing imports omitted for clarity
} from "botbuilder";
```

Locate the card in the `else` statement in the `onMessage()` handler you added in the previous section.

Add a second action button to the card that will trigger the creation of a new message:

```typescript
{
  "type": "Action.Submit",
  "title": "Create new thread in this channel",
  "data": { cardAction: "newconversation" }
}
```

The card should now look like the following:

```typescript
const card = CardFactory.adaptiveCard({
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.0",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "Container",
      "items": [
        {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "text": "Adaptive card response",
          "weight": "bolder",
          "size": "large"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "Container",
      "items": [
        {
          "type": "TextBlock",
          "text": "Demonstrates how to respond with a card, update the card & ultimately delete the response.",
          "wrap": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "Action.Submit",
      "title": "Update card",
      "data": value
    },
    {
      "type": "Action.Submit",
      "title": "Create new thread in this channel",
      "data": { cardAction: "newconversation" }
    }
  ]
});
```

Next, add another `case` statement to the `switch (context.activity.value.cardAction)` statement the `onMessage()` handler to detect this new action:

```typescript
case "newconversation":
  const message = MessageFactory.text("This will be the first message in a new thread");
  await this.createConversation(context, message);
  break;
```

The last step is to add the `createConversation()` method that will create the new conversation. Add the following method to the `ConversationalBot` class:

```typescript
private async createConversation(context: TurnContext, message: Partial<Activity>): Promise<void> {
  // get a reference to the bot adapter & create a connection to the Teams API
  const adapter = <BotFrameworkAdapter>context.adapter;

  // create a new conversation and get a reference to it
  const conversationReference = <ConversationReference>TurnContext.getConversationReference(context.activity);

  // send message
  await adapter.continueConversation(conversationReference, async turnContext => {
    await turnContext.sendActivity(message);
  });
}
```

### Test the bot sending new messages

From the command line, navigate to the root folder for the project and execute the following command:

```console
gulp ngrok-serve
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recall from a previous exercise, Ngrok will create a new subdomain. You need to update your bot registration's **Messaging endpoint** in the Azure portal (*shown in a previous exercise*) with this new domain before testing it.

In the Microsoft Teams client, go to the channel you installed the bot in the previous section. From the **Conversations** tab, @mention the bot with a random string to trigger the `else` condition.

The bot will reply to the message with the updated card that contains two buttons:

Select the second button, **Create new thread in this channel**. Within a few seconds, you should see a new conversation appear in the channel:

## Summary

In this exercise, you’ll modify the existing Microsoft Teams app update the bot to send a proactive message from your bot.
