In this module, we’ll explain the prerequisite steps you’ll need to take care of in the Microsoft Azure portal along with connecting to your existing directory service, before you deploy your first Windows Virtual Desktop virtual machines. We’ll go through the exact steps and PowerShell cmdlets you’ll need to run for Windows Virtual Desktop. 

If you’ve ever provisioned a large-scale Remote Desktop Services environment, you’ll be familiar with all the components, complexity, and time required to get everything up and running, as well as the operational steps needed to right-size the infrastructure. With Windows Virtual Desktop, this is much faster and easier, since most steps go away and the RDS infrastructure roles themselves are now managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) components that you don’t need to provision or manage. This architecture helps simplify initial setup and day-to-day operations. You will only need to manage OS images, apps, users, and the scale of the environment, but not the physical hardware. 

That said, there are still a few prerequisites now with services running in the cloud that you’ll want to be aware of – especially if you’ve historically run everything in your datacenters.
