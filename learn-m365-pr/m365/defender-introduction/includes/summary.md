As a security analyst, you were tasked with exploring the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Defender and understanding how each of the other Microsoft Defender for Cloud products integrates and shares its data.

By integrating Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps into Microsoft 365 Defender, the broad scope of available data lets your security team see the complete story of an attack from start to finish, allowing them to investigate and remediate incidents more quickly.

Now that you've completed this module, you should:

- Understand how Microsoft 365 Defender uses the threat signals from multiple security services to build a complete and central picture of cyber attacks in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal.
- Understand the purposes of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and how they integrate with Microsoft 365 Defender.
