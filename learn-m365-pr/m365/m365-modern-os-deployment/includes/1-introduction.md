## Introduction to OS deployment
Ultimately, the best measure of success with an OS deployment is meeting user expectations and avoiding disruptions in their work. By focusing on a phased deployment approach, IT admins can start testing and deploying to pilot users without disrupting the broad end user base. As testing completes and the bulk remediation items have been addressed, deployment can be broadened while still having continuous validation through the phased deployment.

In this module weâ€™ll be focusing on putting the pieces together to automate Windows 10 installations as much as possible.
