Failures of an operating system service often result in problems that are not severe enough to prevent the computer from starting, but are enough to restrict functionality. Therefore, it is important that you understand how to identify and resolve service-related startup problems.

 -  Describe operating system services.
 -  Identify failed services by using Windows tools.
