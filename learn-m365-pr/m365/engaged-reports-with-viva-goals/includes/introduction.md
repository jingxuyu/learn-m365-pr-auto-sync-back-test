Viva Goals provides visibility on a wide range of data and provides tools that allow you to engage with this information and your colleagues.

Imagine you're the lead of a team who is spearheading a new product launch at your organization. Not only do you have your own OKRs in place to track and update, but you're also working with other teams, like Marketing and Customer Experience, so you need to be aware of their progress against their OKRs as well.

For a successful product launch, you need to be able to engage with the progress of other teams, locate other OKRs within your company that could impact your product launch, and deliver valuable updates on your progress to different groups of people on a regular basis.

By the end of this module, you will be able to engage and deliver information of value to all concerned parties.
