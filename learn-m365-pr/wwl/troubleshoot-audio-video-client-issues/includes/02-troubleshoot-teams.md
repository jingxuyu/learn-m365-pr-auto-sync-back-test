When users experience calling problems, an organization's Teams administrator must quickly diagnose and fix the problems. Troubleshooting problems within Microsoft Teams may include a wide array of possible areas that must be investigated. Issues can be examined in the log files and various tools. 

## Resources from Microsoft

Common problems are documented in the Teams Troubleshooting section of the Microsoft Teams documentation. If there's a problem, refer to this documentation for details of symptoms, causes, and how it can be resolved.

## Check client connectivity

If you're experiencing connectivity issues with the Teams client, the most likely causes are firewall or proxy settings. Verify the necessary URLs, IP addresses, and ports are opened in the organization's firewall or proxy server. The following services require specific URLs and ports to be opened in the firewall:

* Authentication
* Microsoft Teams Client Connectivity
* Collaboration
* Media
* Shared Services
* Third-party Integration
* Skype for Business Interoperability
* Skype for Business Client Interoperability

**Additional reading**. For more information on the URLs and IPs required for Microsoft Teams, see [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?azure-portal=true).

For more information on Microsoft Teams networking requirements, see [Prepare your organization's network for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/prepare-network?azure-portal=true).

## Tools for monitoring and troubleshooting

The following tools are designed to help organizations monitor and troubleshoot call quality in Microsoft Teams:

* **Log files**: Log files are created automatically and provide information to help troubleshoot specific issues.

* **Call Analytics**: Call analytics provide detailed information about the devices, networks, and connectivity related to  specific calls and meetings for each user in Teams. Teams administrators and helpdesk agents use this information to troubleshoot call quality and connection problems in a specific call.

* **Call Quality Dashboard**: Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) provides a network-wide view of call quality across an organization. Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) is designed to help Microsoft Teams administrators, Skype for Business administrators, and network engineers optimize a network.

* **Direct Routing Health Dashboard**: Health Dashboard for Direct Routing monitors the connection between a Session Border Controller (SBC) and the Direct Routing interface.
