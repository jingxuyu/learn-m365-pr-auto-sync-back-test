There are four different roles relevant to Workplace Analytics, with different data-access rights and responsibilities. They are:

1. The **Microsoft 365 administrator** is responsible for assigning Workplace Analytics licenses to user mailboxes and for assigning the other Workplace Analytics roles to users. A user with this role does not have access to the Workplace Analytics application (unless they also assign themself one of the Workplace Analytics roles).
2. The **Workplace Analytics administrator** sets system defaults and privacy settings for your companyâ€™s Workplace Analytics environment and is responsible for uploading and verifying organizational/HR data. This role has access to the Settings menu, and through it, the Data sources, Upload, and Admin settings pages.
3. A **Workplace Analytics analyst** has full access to all Workplace Analytics product features (except the **Settings** menu), including the ability to directly query the full dataset. This role is typically assigned to analysts who require complete data access to perform analyses.
4. A Workplace Analytics analyst (limited) has the same access to those in the analyst role but with the following restrictions:
   - No access to Queries
   - Read-only access to the **Analysis settings** page

To get started with Workplace Analytics, your Microsoft 365 Administrator will need to assign the roles of Workplace Analytics administrator and Workplace Analytics analyst.

>[!NOTE]
>Only users with Workplace Analytics roles assigned can log in to the Workplace Analytics web application and access the data.
