Microsoft 365 Apps includes the Microsoft productivity suite of applications, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams for both Windows and Mac devices. Microsoft 365 Apps isn't just a web-based version of Office - instead it's a full version of Office that your users install and run on all their devices. The Office applications that come with Microsoft 365 Apps are fully compatible with the on-premises or online versions of Exchange Server or SharePoint Server.

You can install Microsoft 365 Apps from a network share or directly from the internet. After it's installed, you don’t have to be connected to the internet to use Microsoft 365 Apps. However, you'll need to connect at least once every 30 days to ensure your license is still active. Microsoft 365 Apps is updated either monthly or semi-annually with new features, security updates, and other quality updates from Microsoft. You should choose which frequency works best for your organization by selecting specific update channels. Office 365 Business and Office 365 ProPlus will both become Microsoft 365 Apps. Where necessary we will use the ‘for business’ and ‘for enterprise’ labels to distinguish between the two. There are no price or feature changes to plans at this time.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Apps are available in both Microsoft 365 Apps for business and Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise subscriptions. The version of Microsoft 365 Apps will differ dependent on your subscription type, but the apps are the same.

## Connected experiences in Office

Microsoft 365 Apps is getting smarter all the time, adding new cloud-enhanced features that can save you time and produce better results. These features help you improve your writing in Word and Outlook, analyze your data in Excel, and deliver dynamic presentations in PowerPoint. Microsoft 365 has a number of helpful features that are backed by cloud-based services, which we call "connected experiences", that provide essential functionality for those features.

There are two types of connected experiences, experiences that analyze your content and experiences that download online content.

### Experiences that analyze your content

These experiences use your Office content to provide design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features.

### Experiences that download online content

These experiences connect to the Internet for online content including templates, images, and data. For example, if you display the weather forecast in Outlook, Outlook connects to Bing to retrieve the relevant weather data.

Connected experiences include:

 -  Ideas is a feature in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint to provide intelligent suggestions to improve documents. This might include recommending acronyms or adding a table of contents.
 -  Neural rewrites suggests alternate ways to write a phrase in Word.
 -  Designer is a PowerPoint feature that suggests intelligent design recommendations including branded templates.

> [!NOTE]
> To turn off connected experiences go to File &gt; Account &gt; Manage Settings (In Outlook it's under Office Account). From there you can disable Experiences that analyze your content, Experiences that download online content, or All connected experiences.
