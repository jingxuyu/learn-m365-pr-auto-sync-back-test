FastTrack helps organizations in onboarding to Microsoft 365, including core and service onboarding, adoption guidance, and data migration.

There are four steps in a typical FastTrack engagement:

1.  **Start the onboarding process.** A FastTrack Center representative will contact you within 30 days of your eligible purchase of Microsoft 365, EMS, or Azure, or you can request assistance if youâ€™re ready to start sooner. Your FastTrack team and your in-house project team will meet to review your onboarding needs.
2.  **Assess your environment.** Your FastTrack engineer will work with your project team to assess your IT environment. The purpose of this collaboration is to identify any aspects of your current infrastructure that must be changed to better ensure a great experience.
3.  **Remediate any issues.** Your FastTrack engineer will provide a checklist and plan to remediate any issues that were uncovered during the assessment process.
4.  **Enable core capabilities.** Your FastTrack team will ensure that:
    
     -  Your cloud solution is ready to use.
     -  Licenses are assigned appropriately.
     -  Eligible services are migrated.

Onboarding consists of the following options:

 -  **Core onboarding**. Core onboarding helps an organization set up the basic service. This service includes the configuration and synchronization of identities from the organization's existing Active Directory, with tools provided by Microsoft.
 -  **Service onboarding and migration**. Service onboarding includes the setup process for the specific Microsoft 365 workload the organization wants to migrate. FastTrack helps an organization understand the tasks needed to configure its source email environment, which can be either Exchange on-premises or selected third-party email systems, such as IBM Domino or Novell GroupWise.

User adoption services are a set of tasks that help organizations ensure their users are aware of the changes coming their way and how they can make use of the provided services. This benefit occurs in parallel to onboarding activities and provides companies with guidance and information they must distribute to end users.

### When to use Microsoft FastTrack

An organization can consider FastTrack when its existing messaging environment is one of the following source systems:

 -  A single or multiple Active Directory forests with a single or multiple Exchange organizations.
 -  A single IBM Domino 7.0.3 or later environment.
 -  A single IMAP-capable email environment.
 -  A single Google Apps for Work environment (Gmail, Contacts, and Calendar only).
 -  A single Novell GroupWise 7.0.4 or later environment.

### Using FastTrack to move mailboxes

Migrating mailboxes to Exchange Online is probably one of the most time-consuming parts of a migration project. FastTrack Center migration services include resources that help organizations migrate their mailboxes as quickly as possible. They add migration batches on your defined schedule, and they monitor and complete the migration batches. These features can help save time and allow companies to focus on helping their users explore the new services.
