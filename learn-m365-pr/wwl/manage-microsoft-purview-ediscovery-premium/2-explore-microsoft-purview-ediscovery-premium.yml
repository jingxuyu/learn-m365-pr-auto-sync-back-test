As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson has created an eDiscovery case in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. The purpose of the case is to address a legal issue facing the company. Several Contoso employees have since been identified as potential persons of interest in the investigation. What should Holly do next?"

      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't what Holly should do next."
