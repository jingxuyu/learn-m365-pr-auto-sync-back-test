  questions:

  - content: "Which of the following processes are part of the Microsoft-managed services in a WVD deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Gateway."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft manages the Gateway."
    - content: "Identity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Identity is customer-managed."
    - content: "Web browser."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The end user needs to manage this."
      
  - content: "Why is it a security recommendation to use RemoteApp?"
    choices:
    - content: "For faster access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Access might be faster, but that's not the reason for the security recommendation."
    - content: "Reduced attack surface area."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. RemoteApp reduces risk by only letting the user work with a subset of the remote machine exposed."
    - content: "Connecting to a virtual machine in a host pool is more secure."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Both access methods are secure."
      
  - content: "Which of the following should you enable in a secure WVD deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "A common administration password to limit complexity."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. From a security perspective, this is a bad idea and makes logging for accountability useless."
    - content: "Reduce logging for performance reasons."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Logging strengthens the overall security of your environment."
    - content: "Multifactor authentication using Azure AD."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This should be required for all users."
