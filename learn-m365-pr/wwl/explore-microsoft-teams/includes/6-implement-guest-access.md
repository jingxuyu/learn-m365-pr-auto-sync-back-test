Guest access is a feature in Microsoft Teams that enables teams in your organization to collaborate with people outside your organization. Guest access grants these external users access to your internal teams and channels. This feaure is included with all Office 365 Business Premium, Office 365 Enterprise, and Office 365 Education subscriptions. No other Microsoft 365 license is necessary. Guest access is a tenant-level setting in Microsoft Teams and is turned off by default.

A guest is someone who isn't an employee, student, or member of your organization. As such, a guest doesn't have a school or work account with your organization. Guests typically include partners, vendors, suppliers, and consultants. Anyone can be added as a guest in Microsoft Teams. This design means that anyone with a business (with an Azure AD account) or consumer email account (for example, Outlook.com or Gmail.com) can participate as a guest in Teams. Guests are provided with full access to team chats, meetings, and files. All guests in Teams are covered by the same compliance and auditing protection as the rest of Microsoft 365. They can be managed securely within Azure AD.

Organizations using Teams can maintain complete control over their own corporate data while providing external access to teams, documents in channels, resources, chats, and applications to their partners.

The following graphic shows that for guest access to work, users in each tenant must have access to Teams (licenses). Guest users must also use their own Azure AD user accounts from their originating tenant to access the remote Teams resources in another tenant. The picture also shows that “Guest access” (the dotted user) simply refers to shadow users in other users’ tenants that always refer to their original Azure AD user object.
