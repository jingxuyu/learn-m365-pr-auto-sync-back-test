Threat protection starts with reducing yo*ur overall attack surface, helping prevent attacks in the first place. Reduce the number of places where attackers can find a way into the system, network, or an endpoint. By intercepting threats in mail or document sharing, and detecting unusual operating system behaviors, you help isolate users from attacks.

But when an attack occurs, security teams need to detect and block them quickly. Preventing attacks is part of the story, but you also need to be able detect and respond to breaches. Itâ€™s not a matter of if but *when* a company will be breached. You need to be prepared with the right tools. Microsoft 365 provides capabilities to help, such as our ability to detect memory and kernel-based attacks on endpoints. 

In the event of a breach, you need to respond quickly to contain the damage and prevent further infection. You need to be able to review and triage incoming issues easily -  Microsoft 365 security features supporting incident management and alerts can help. The automated investigation and remediation capability highlights critical issues and automatically helps prevent the spread of an attack, helping you investigate and analyze the issue. 

Microsoft Threat Protection is backed by the intelligent security graph, a vast collection of signals and insights that helps Microsoft protect its customers.

Bringing these signals together into a graph helps Microsoft spot attack patterns and share information across products to customers.
