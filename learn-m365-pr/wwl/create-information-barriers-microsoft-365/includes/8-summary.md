Microsoft 365 enables communication and collaboration across different teams within an organization. However, sometimes it's necessary to restrict these services so they don't create a conflict for the organization. These scenarios often include conflict of interest situations where the information shared could interfere with business ethics or business practices. Microsoft 365 addresses this situation by enabling organizations to create information barriers. These tools were the focus of this module.

This module examined how Information barriers and ethical walls enable administrators to restrict communication and collaboration between certain teams to safeguard the internal information. Information barriers are policies designed to prevent certain segments of users from communicating with each other, or allow specific segments to communicate only with certain other segments. You learned how Information barrier policies can help your organization maintain compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, and avoid potential conflicts of interest.

This module also examined how an Exchange transport rule, or ethical wall, can prevent users in different departments from exchanging email using their corporate accounts. You learned how administrators can create an information barrier to prohibit file sharing and prevent communication between the two groups within Microsoft Teams.
