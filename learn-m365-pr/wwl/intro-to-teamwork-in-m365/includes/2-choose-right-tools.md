### Personal productivity
Personal productivity is often about choosing the right tool and people to work with. Use **Microsoft Teams** to let the team members stay tightly connected on project updates and related content and files no matter where they are located. 

You may not work with certain people on a regular basis, but who you may have a vested interest, like a project stakeholder or common goal. Use **Yammer** to openly share information, find expertise, and share ideas across your organization. Groups and conversations are open and viewable to everyone. If you prefer working in email, **Outlook** is an ideal way to start the conversation. 

When it comes to managing team content and files, **SharePoint** is the tool that brings together content from Microsoft Teams, Yammer, and Outlook to keep track of critical project information no matter where the conversation starts.
