A record is a document or other electronic or physical entity that provides evidence of an activity or transaction completed by an organization and now requires retention. Microsoft's solution for records management helps organizations manage their legal obligations, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of items that are no longer needed. It supports the full content lifecycle, from creation, through collaboration, record declaration, event-based retention, and disposition. Tailored workflows, like disposition review, coupled with deep insights, provide greater visibility into remediation. Records management in Microsoft 365 helps organizations maintain a robust program and document evidence related to the defensible disposition of corporate records.

This module shows you how to configure the content lifecycle through customizable options using the records management feature in Microsoft 365.
