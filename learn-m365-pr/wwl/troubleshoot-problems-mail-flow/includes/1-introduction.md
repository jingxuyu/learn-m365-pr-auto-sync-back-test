Exchange Online provides flexible options that you can use to govern mail flow. However, it can be challenging to spot the cause of problems when mail doesn't flow to the right destination.

Suppose you work for a company that manufactures shoes and sells them in several different territories. You've been hired to investigate and resolve problems that have arisen with email delivery. Exchange Online has recently been deployed by a project team that is inexperienced with SMTP, Exchange transport rules, and other important configuration options. You must resolve the mail delivery issues as quickly as possible.

 In this module, you'll learn how to resolve problems that prevent email from flowing to the correct destination promptly.
