Your organization must meet [certain technical requirements](/viva/connections/plan-viva-connections#step-1-meet-technical-requirements) before installing and setting up Viva Connections. More information on technical requirements will be reviewed in depth in [module 2](/learn/modules/viva-connections-plan).

**Step 1 – Create a home site**: Create a SharePoint communication site
and [set it as a home site in the SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/home-site). Home sites activate special features and provide a landing portal for the entire organization. [Learn more about how to plan, build, and launch a home site](/viva/connections/home-site-plan).
Once a home site has been created, you’ll be able to [create the Dashboard](/viva/connections/create-dashboard).

**Step 2 – Customize global navigation:** [Enable global navigation for the SharePoint application bar](/viva/connections/sharepoint-app-bar). This customizable feature allows users to find the information that’s most important to them such as news, sites, and files anywhere in SharePoint. Navigational links in global navigation get inherited by the Viva Connections Resource experience. Without setting up global navigation, there won't be any links in the Resources tab in the mobile app.

**Step 3 – Audit and modernize sites and content**: Ensure sites that will receive a high volume of traffic are [modernized](/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-classic-sites). For example, if you create cards on the Dashboard that link to HR (Human Resources) portals, you'll want to ensure the HR portal is modern and meets [healthy portal guidelines](/sharepoint/portal-health). Sites that haven't been modernized will open in a separate browser window instead of in Microsoft Teams.
