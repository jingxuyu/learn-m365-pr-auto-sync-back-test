Windows introduces a new setup experience for you to choose the settings that are right for you. This experience, which replaces previous Express Settings, will look slightly different depending on the version of Windows you are using. If you are moving from Windows 8.1, or doing a fresh install of Windows 10 or 11, the new setup experience will clearly show you simple, but important settings and you will need to choose your settings before you can move forward with setup.
