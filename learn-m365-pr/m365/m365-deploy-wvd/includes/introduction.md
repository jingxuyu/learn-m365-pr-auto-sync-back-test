As we go through the Azure Resource Manager template used to provision Windows Virtual Desktop host pools, we’ll review your options for:  
- Creating pooled or personal virtual machines 
- Choosing images, including the Windows images available in the Azure gallery  
- Using domain-joined user accounts versus service identities. 

By default the Windows Virtual Desktop host pool configures a remote desktop for each user account. Users can also choose apps from app groups to use on their remote desktops. We’ll show you how to modify the apps and desktop experiences available to users.
