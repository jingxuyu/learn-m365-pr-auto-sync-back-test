In this module, you learned how to create and add task modules to your Microsoft Teams app.

Task modules are modals that you can populate with either an Adaptive Card or an embedded web/content page for use in your custom Microsoft Teams app's user experience for workflows that require data input. Task modules allow you to gather information in a Teams-aware popup.
