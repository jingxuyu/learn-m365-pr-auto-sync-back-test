If you have a device that's running an older version of Windows, you can upgrade it to Windows 10 to benefit from features such as improved security, better management, and integration with cloud services.

In most cases, an upgrade is completed without any issue. In rare cases, an issue or error may occur. This module examined how to resolve those cases when a Windows 10 upgrade error occurs. For example, an issue can occur if you want to upgrade from a 32-bit to 64-bit operating system version and there's insufficient disk space for the upgrade. Or, if the device isn't compatible with Windows 10. In such a case, the setup process will display an error message, and more detailed information is written in the setup log file.

In this module, you learned about the Windows 10 upgrade process. You also learned about the most common Windows 10 upgrade errors and how to identify resolutions to them.

The module then reviewed the use of log files and how they aid in resolving upgrade errors. You began by examining how to use the SetupDiag tool to analyze Windows Setup log files. Next, you learned how to troubleshoot upgrade errors using the log files generated by the Windows 10 upgrade process.

The module concluded by reviewing the common reasons for Windows 10 upgrade failures, the error codes that result from the errors, and how to resolve them.
