There are many network-security threats, which you can group into different categories. Common network-based security threats include:

 -  **Eavesdropping**. An eavesdropping attack, also known as network sniffing, occurs when a hacker captures network packets that workstations connected to your network send and receive. Eavesdropping attacks can compromise your organizationâ€™s sensitive data, such as passwords, which can lead to other, more damaging attacks.
 -  **Denial of service (DoS) attack**. This type of attack limits the function of a network app, or renders an app or network resource unavailable. Hackers can initiate a DoS attack in several ways, and often are aware of vulnerabilities in the target app that they can exploit to render it unavailable. Hackers typically perform DoS attacks by overloading a service that replies to network requests, such as Domain Name System (DNS), with a large number of fake requests in an attempt to overload and shut down a service or the server that hosts the service. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a version of a DoS attack.
 -  **Port scanning**. Apps that run on a computer using the TCP/IP protocol use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports to identify themselves. One way that attackers exploit a network is to query hosts for open ports on which they listen for client requests. Once attackers identify an open port, they can use other attack techniques to access the services that are running on the computer.
 -  **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack**. The network attacker uses a computer to impersonate a legitimate host on the network with which your computers are communicating. The attacker intercepts all of the communications that are intended for a destination host. The attacker might wish to view the data in transit between the two hosts, but also can modify that data before forwarding the packets to the destination host.
