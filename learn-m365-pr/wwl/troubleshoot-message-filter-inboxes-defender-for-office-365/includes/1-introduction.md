Large volumes of unsolicited or irrelevant emails can threaten productivity and security in your organization. Exchange Online has powerful tools to filter nuisance mail but these options can cause problems if they are misconfigured or overused.

Suppose you work for a company that runs marketing campaigns for client organizations. Because these campaigns publicize real email addresses, your organization receives large volumes of email. You have implemented many filter policies, inbox rules, and other tools to reduce email volume. Now, some important emails are not arriving, and you suspect that some filters have been incorrectly configured. You must troubleshoot email filtering quickly and ensure that your users receive mission-critical emails reliably.

In this module, you’ll learn how Exchange Online and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 filter incoming email. You’ll also see how to ensure that such filters don’t remove important messages.
