    questions:
    - content: "Your department has bought new laptops, and you are now ready to install Microsoft 365 Apps. Which version should you install?"
      choices:
      - content: "64-bit"

        explanation: "Correct! The 64-bit version will give better performance and should be installed on up to date hardware."

        explanation: "Microsoft 365 Apps is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, but you should install the 64-bit version on new hardware to take advantage of better performance."
    - content: "32-bit or 64-bit - it doesn't matter"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Microsoft 365 Apps is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, but you should only install the 32-bit version if your hardware has 32-bit dependencies. New hardware will be 64-bit, so you should install the 64-bit version."

      choices:
      - content: "UWP"

      - content: "Click-to-Run"

      choices:
      - content: "System Center Configuration Manager"
        isCorrect: false

      - content: "Desktop App Assure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "No. Desktop App Assure is a program that fixes incompatible business apps at no cost to you - it's not a distribution tool."
      - content: "Office Deployment Tool"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The Office Deployment Tool doesn't work with MSI-based packages to deliver your business apps. It's used to install Click-to-Run packages of Office."

        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "No. Use Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, and other software distribution tools to deploy business apps. You can use package injection into offline images to keep drivers, features, and a limited number of application runtimes up to date, but not apps themselves."
