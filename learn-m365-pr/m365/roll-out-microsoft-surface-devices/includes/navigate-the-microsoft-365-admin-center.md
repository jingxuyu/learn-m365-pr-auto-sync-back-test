Your Microsoft 365 subscription includes tools to manage users and devices. You want to explore how to support the new Surface devices purchased for the organization.

In this unit, you'll see how to navigate between the various admin centers and portals. Then you'll get a high-level view of the features you'll use in each of them.

## Microsoft 365 admin center

The Microsoft 365 admin center lets you manage your business in the cloud. You can add or remove users, change the licenses assigned to them, and reset their passwords. You can also manage devices, security, compliance, and access all the other related admin centers conveniently in one place.

You can configure the home page to show the information that's most relevant to you. The admin center lets you add, arrange, and remove cards that represent different categories for you to manage.

## Azure Active Directory

In the next units, you'll see how to use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to control security features for users in your organization. For example, this is where you can enable a combined security registration experience and passwordless sign-in with Microsoft Authenticator. There are two links from the Microsoft 365 admin center, or you can go to [https://aad.portal.azure.com](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) in your browser.

From the menu on the left, under Admin centers, select **Azure Active Directory**. The other link is from the **All admin centers** page. At the top of the list, select **Azure Active Directory**.

## Microsoft Endpoint Manager

Microsoft Endpoint Manager (MEM) admin center lets you create and manage your organization's devices. You can create and manage policies that change your devices at the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI or BIOS) level. This brings together the power of the cloud management provided by Intune, and the on-premises device management of Configuration Manager.

Like Azure AD, there are two links from the Microsoft 365 admin center, or you can go to <https://endpoint.microsoft.com>.

## Teams admin center

The Teams admin center gives you tools to manage how Teams are used in your organization. You can create and modify Teams, add members or channels, and change owners for existing teams.

The Teams admin center is listed like the previous centers in the left navigation menu. On the **All admin centers** page you'll need to scroll to the bottom, or go to it directly at <https://admin.teams.microsoft.com>.
