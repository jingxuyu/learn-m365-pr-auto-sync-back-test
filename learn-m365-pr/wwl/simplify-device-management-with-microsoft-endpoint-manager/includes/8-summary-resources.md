## Summary

You have seen how modern management allows you to simplify deployment and management, improve security, provide better end-user experiences, and lower costs for your Windows devices. You can now manage Windows 10 devices of all kinds, from desktop PCs to HoloLens and Surface Hubs, company-owned or employee-owned, as well as mobile devices using one management platform.

You have also seen Microsoft Endpoint Manager, the convergence of Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager, offers a seamless, end-to-end management solution without the complexity of a migration or disruption to productivity.

Windows Autopilot is a collection of technologies used to set up and pre-configure new devices, getting them ready for productive use. You can use Windows Autopilot to reset, repurpose and recover devices. This solution enables an IT department to achieve the above with little to no infrastructure to manage, with a process that's easy and simple.
