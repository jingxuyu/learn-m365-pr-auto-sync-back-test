  questions:
  - content: "Fabrikam has submitted a retention policy for workloads. How long can it take for the policy to take effect?"
    choices:
    - content: "Five days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value isn't the maximum number of days for a policy to normally take effect."
    - content: "Seven days"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you create and submit a retention policy, it can take up to seven days for the retention policy to take effect."
    - content: "10 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value isn't the maximum number of days for a policy to normally take effect."
  - content: "How long does an eDiscovery hold preserve data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Until the end date of the retention period is reached"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The start and end of the preservation period for eDiscovery holds isn't configurable."
    - content: "Until the end date of the retention period is reached, but no more than 180 days after the start date"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The start and end of the preservation period for eDiscovery holds isn't configurable."
    - content: "Until an administrator manually releases the hold"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If content is subject to both retention settings and an eDiscovery hold, preserving content for the eDiscovery hold always takes precedence. In this way, the principles of retention expand to eDiscovery holds because they preserve data until an administrator manually releases the hold. However, despite this precedence, organizations shouldn't use eDiscovery holds for long-term data lifecycle management."
  - content: "Contoso wants to manually apply retention settings. How can it accomplish this task?"
    choices:
    - content: "By implementing a retention policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Retention policies can only be automatically applied."
    - content: "By implementing a retention label"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Retention policies and retention labels can both be automatically applied. However, only retention labels can be manually applied."
    - content: "Contoso can't manually apply retention settings; they must be automatically applied through retention policies or labels"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Retention settings can be manually applied."
