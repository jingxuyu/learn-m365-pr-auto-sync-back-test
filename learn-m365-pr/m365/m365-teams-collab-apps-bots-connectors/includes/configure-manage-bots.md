Bots are automated programs that respond to queries or give updates and notifications (e.g. welcome message to a new team member). Bots enable users to interact with cloud services like task management, scheduling, and polling in a Teams chat. Teams supports bots in private chats, group chats, and channels within a team. Administrators can control whether the use of bots is allowed in an Office 365 tenant.

## Create custom bots for Microsoft Teams

Bots developed by the community can be used within Teams. The bot's functionality and the ability to upload custom apps (also known as sideloading) must be enabled at the tenant level for custom bots to be functional. 

You can create a bot that integrates into your business applications, using the **Microsoft Bot Framework**. You can require your users to log in before using the bot, which makes sure only employees of your organization can access it, even if its application ID becomes known.
