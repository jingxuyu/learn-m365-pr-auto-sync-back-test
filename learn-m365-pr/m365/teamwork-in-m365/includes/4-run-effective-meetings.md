Itâ€™s estimated that the average knowledge worker spends nearly one third of the week in meetings. The most productive meetings bring together subject matter experts and project teams to have focused, interactive discussions that help them make informed decisions. The key to achieving this productivity is better preparation, supported by tools that encourage positive work and meeting habits.

During meetings, video and screen sharing create a focus among the group, while new AI services provide auto-translation, transcription, and recording so participants get more out of the experience. Following the meeting, notes and action items can be automatically transcribed and distributed to the group, and anyone who was unable to attend can easily go back and watch the meeting.
