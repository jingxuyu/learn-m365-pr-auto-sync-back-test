Microsoft Viva brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights into an integrated experience that empowers people and teams to be their best, from anywhere. Powered by the full breadth and depth of Microsoft 365, it is experienced through Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 apps that people use every day.

## A new kind of employee experience

To start, Microsoft Viva will include four modules: Viva Insights, Viva Topics, Viva Learning, and Viva Connections—with more on the way.

### Insights

**Microsoft Viva Insights** is a new unified app in Teams that brings together Workplace Analytics, MyAnalytics and Glint. It provides quantitative and qualitative data and insights to empower individuals, managers, and leaders to improve organizational productivity and wellbeing.

Accessed in Microsoft Teams, Viva Insights for **individuals** help employees stay connected with their colleagues and protect time for regular breaks, focused work, and learning.

For **managers**, Viva Insights can provide data-driven, privacy-protected insights and recommendations to foster healthy, successful teams. For instance, Viva Insights can help a manager see if their team is at risk of burnout and provide recommendations like encouraging your team to turn off notifications, set boundaries in their calendar, and set daily priorities to focus on what matters most.

For **company leaders**, Viva Insights can help address complex challenges and respond to change by shedding light on organizational work patterns and trends. These could include wellbeing opportunities, but also things like space planning as companies re-imagine their offices for hybrid work.

To help ensure **privacy and security**, Microsoft Viva uses aggregation, de-identification, and differential privacy. This means personal insights are visible only to the employee, while insights for managers and leaders are aggregated and de-identified by default to protect individual privacy.

### Topics

**Microsoft Viva Topics** focuses on knowledge and expertise. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify knowledge and experts and organize them into shared topics. Topic pages are surfaced as cards right in the flow of work in Office and Teams.

Viva Topics automatically surfaces topic cards as people work in apps like Office, SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams. When employees click on a card, a topic page appears with documents, videos, and related people. Experts at the company can also help curate the information shown in Viva Topics by sharing knowledge through simple, highly customizable web sites called Topic Pages.

Along with content from the Microsoft Cloud, Viva Topics also surfaces information from third-party services like ServiceNow and Salesforce and builds on integrations made by partners like Accenture, Avanade, BA Insight, Raytion, and ClearPeople. And Graph connectors make it easy to connect to even more content that employees would find helpful.

### Learning

**Microsoft Viva Learning** allows employees to easily discover informal and formal learning in the flow of work. It aggregates content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, 3rd party training content, and internal content of your own. Along with providing aggregation and recommendations, it also allows managers to assign, track, and report on training within and across multiple teams.

With Viva Learning, employees can easily discover and share everything from training courses to micro-learning content. And managers get the tools they need to assign learning and to track the completion of courses to help foster a learning culture. Viva Learning creates a central hub for learning in Teams, with AI that recommends the right content at the right time. 

It aggregates content from LinkedIn Learning, Microsoft Learn, your organization’s own custom content, and trainings from leading content providers like Skillsoft, Coursera, Pluralsight, and edX. Viva Learning also works with leading learning-management systems.

### Connections

**Microsoft Viva Connections** brings all these experiences together into a company-branded employee app in Teams. It builds on the existing capabilities of SharePoint and Yammer and provides a curated, customized employee destination. It allows organizations to communicate and engage with employees and enables easy access to all the resources an employee needs to be successful.

### Open, extensible, and with more to come

Designed to be an open and extensible platform, Microsoft Viva is easy to integrate with the systems and tools a company already has in place. Integrations with Microsoft 365, Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and third-party products and services will deliver a complete employee experience in the flow of work.

We all know that engaged, healthy employees who feel a sense of ownership, purpose, and belonging have a greater impact on our organizations. With Microsoft Viva, we aim to make it easier and more natural for everyone to stay connected, access knowledge, learn on the job, and use privacy-protected insights—to enable individuals to prioritize wellbeing, empower managers to lead more effectively, and help leaders drive better decision-making across the organization. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build people-centered experiences that help drive extraordinary outcomes.
