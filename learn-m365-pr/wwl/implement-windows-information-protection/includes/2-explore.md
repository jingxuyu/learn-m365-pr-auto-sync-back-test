Effective collaboration means that you need to share data with others in your enterprise. This sharing can be from one extreme where everyone has access to everything without any security, all the way to the other extreme where people can’t share anything and it’s all highly secured. Most enterprises fall somewhere in between the two extremes, where success is balanced between providing the necessary access with the potential for improper data disclosure.

As an admin, you can address the question of who gets access to your data by using access controls, such as employee credentials. However, just because someone has the right to access your data doesn’t guarantee the data will remain within the secured locations of the enterprise. So while access controls are a great start, they’re not enough.

> [!WARNING]
> In the end, all these security measures have one thing in common: employees will tolerate only so much inconvenience before looking for ways around the security restrictions. For example, if you don’t allow employees to share files through a protected system, employees will turn to an outside app that more than likely lacks security controls.

Microsoft developed Windows Information Protection (WIP) to specifically address this issue. WIP is an Azure cloud service that helps protect against areas of potential data leakage without interfering with the employee experience. WIP helps to protect enterprise data and apps against accidental data leakage on user devices, even if personal apps are used or private websites are visited.

Modern information protection in today's cybersecurity landscape consists of four different parts that must be identified. These parts are described in the following graphic.<br>

The following table describes how WIP provides a solution for all the modern information protection requirements.<br>

Device protection


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Any device that contains sensitive data must be protected against theft or loss by encrypting its hard drives.

Windows includes BitLocker for this scenario.

Data separation


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

If using company-owned or personal devices to access sensitive company data, you must identify personal vs. corporate data. By doing so, corporate data can be contained and securely wiped on-demand.

  :::column:::
    

Windows Information Protection (WIP) separates corporate apps and personal apps. It also tags all data generated by or coming from corporate apps.

Leak protection


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Customers must prevent corporate data from leaking in an unauthorized way. For example, if data from corporate documents is copied into a non-corporate location such as Twitter, or if unauthorized apps access corporate data.


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Windows can control whether corporate data is processed within managed apps. It can also block or warn users if they want to copy tagged corporate data into unsecure locations, or if apps try to access the data when they don't have permission to do so.

Sensitive data must be protected when it's shared with others both inside and outside your organization.

Azure Information Protection can protect and label documents shared with internal and external users.

### Why use WIP?<br>

WIP is the Mobile Application Management (MAM) mechanism in Windows 10. WIP gives you a new way to manage data policy enforcement for apps and documents on Windows 10 desktop operating systems. It also provides the ability to remove access to enterprise data from both enterprise and personal devices (after enrollment in an enterprise management solution, such as Intune).

 -  **Change the way you think about data policy enforcement.** As an enterprise admin, you need to maintain compliance in your data policy and data access. WIP helps protect enterprise on both corporate and employee-owned devices, even when the employee isn’t using the device. When employees create content on an enterprise-protected device, they can choose to save it as a work document. If it's a work document, it becomes locally maintained as enterprise data.
 -  **Manage your enterprise documents, apps, and encryption modes.** WIP provides solutions for the following scenarios:
    
     -  **Copying or downloading enterprise data.** When an employee or an app downloads content from a location like SharePoint, a network share, or an enterprise web location, while using a WIP-protected device, WIP encrypts the data on the device.
     -  **Using protected apps.** Managed apps (apps that you've included on the Protected apps list in your WIP policy) are allowed to access your enterprise data and will interact differently when used with unallowed, non-enterprise aware, or personal-only apps. For example, if WIP management is set to Block, your employees can copy and paste from one protected app to another protected app, but not to personal apps. Imagine an HR person wants to copy a job description from a protected app to the internal career website, an enterprise-protected location, but makes a mistake and tries to paste into a personal app instead. The paste action fails and a notification pops up, saying that the app couldn’t paste because of a policy restriction. The HR person then correctly pastes to the career website without a problem.
     -  **Managed apps and restrictions.** With WIP, you can control which apps can access and use your enterprise data. After adding an app to your protected apps list, the app is trusted with enterprise data. All apps not on this list are stopped from accessing your enterprise data, depending on your WIP management-mode.
        
        You don’t have to modify line-of-business apps that never touch personal data to list them as protected apps; just include them in the protected apps list.
     -  **Deciding your level of data access.** WIP lets you block, allow overrides, or audit employees' data sharing actions. Hiding overrides stops the action immediately. Allowing overrides lets the employee know there's a risk. But it also lets the user continue to share the data while recording and auditing the action. Silent just logs the action without stopping anything that the employee could have overridden while using that setting; collecting info that can help you to see patterns of inappropriate sharing so you can take educative action or find apps that should be added to your protected apps list. For info about how to collect your audit log files, see [How to collect Windows Information Protection (WIP) audit event logs](/windows/security/information-protection/windows-information-protection/collect-wip-audit-event-logs).
     -  **Data encryption at rest.** WIP helps protect enterprise data on local files and on removable media. Apps such as Microsoft Word work with WIP to help continue your data protection across local files and removable media. These apps are being referred to as "enterprise aware." For example, if an employee opens WIP-encrypted content from Word, edits the content, and then tries to save the edited version with a different name, Word automatically applies WIP to the new document.
     -  **Helping prevent accidental data disclosure to public spaces.** WIP helps protect your enterprise data from being accidentally shared to public spaces, such as public cloud storage. For example, if Dropbox™ isn’t on your protected apps list, employees can't sync encrypted files to their personal cloud storage. Instead, if the employee stores the content to an app on your protected apps list, like Microsoft OneDrive for Business, the encrypted files can sync freely to the business cloud, while maintaining the encryption locally.
     -  **Helping prevent accidental data disclosure to removable media.** WIP helps prevent enterprise data from leaking when it's copied or transferred to removable media. For example, if an employee puts enterprise data on a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive that also has personal data, the enterprise data remains encrypted while the personal data doesn’t.
 -  **Remove access to enterprise data from enterprise-protected devices.** WIP gives admins the ability to revoke enterprise data from one or many MDM-enrolled devices, while leaving personal data alone. This feature is a benefit when an employee leaves your company, or if a device is stolen. After determining that the data access needs to be removed, you can use Microsoft Intune to unenroll the device so when it connects to the network, the user's encryption key for the device is revoked, and the enterprise data becomes unreadable.
