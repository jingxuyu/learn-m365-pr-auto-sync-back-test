This module focused on data leakage, and how Microsoft 365 addresses this issue through Information Rights Management (IRM). Leakage of potentially sensitive information can not only be costly for an organization, but it can also have wide-ranging impact on the organization and its business, employees, customers, and partners. Local and industry regulations increasingly govern how certain types of information are stored, transmitted, and secured. The consequences of violating these regulations include financial damages, damages to image and credibility, or loss of competitive advantage.

Traditional solutions, such as email encryption and file permissions, often lack the necessary enforcement tools that apply uniform policies to prevent information leakage. This module addressed these shortcomings by examining how Mirosoft 365 uses Information Rights Management features to apply persistent protection to email and attachments sent from Outlook and Outlook on the web, and Office documents created in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint by the use of user restrictions. In Microsoft 365, IRM uses Azure Rights Management Services (RMS) as part of Azure Information Protection (AIP) to provide a complete IRM solution.

Azure Information Protection is subscription-based. It enables administrators to set up specific labels that can be used to lock down, restrict access, or encrypt emails or documents depending on the label configuration the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator defines. These options are all applied from the end-user perspective on either the Office document or the email they're creating.

In this module, you learned that with effective use of RMS, organizations can:

 -  reduce security risks from wire-tapping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
 -  prevent unwarranted access of data, such as emails and files, that's in-transit or at rest by an unauthorized user who doesn't have appropriate permissions.

These actions are accomplished by encrypting the data and applying policies on the data to limit or allow the actions by the consumer of the data.

The module explored how RMS uses extensible rights markup language (XrML)-based certificates and licenses to certify computers and users, and to protect content. When content such as a document or a message is protected using RMS, an XrML license containing the rights that authorized users have to the content is attached. To access IRM-protected content, Microsoft-enabled applications must get a use license for the authorized user from the RMS cluster.

In this module, you examined the features of Information Rights Management. This exploration began with an analysis of the encryption options that are available in Microsoft 365. You then explored how IRM protects email in Exchange and documents in SharePoint. The module concluded with a comparison of IRM protection and AIP classification.
