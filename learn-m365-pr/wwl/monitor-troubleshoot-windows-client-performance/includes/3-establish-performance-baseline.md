By calculating performance baselines for your client computer environment, you can interpret real-time monitoring information more accurately. A baseline for a computer’s performance indicates what your performance-monitoring statistics look like during normal use. You can establish a baseline by monitoring performance statistics over a specific period. When an issue or symptom occurs in real time, you can compare your baseline statistics to your real-time statistics, and then identify anomalies.

You can set up a baseline in the Performance Monitor to help you with the following tasks:

 -  Evaluate your computer’s workload
 -  Monitor system resources
 -  Notice changes and trends in resource use
 -  Test configuration changes
 -  Diagnose problems

By using data collector sets, you can establish a baseline to use as a standard for comparison. You create a baseline when you first configure the computer, at regular intervals of typical usage, and when you make any changes to the computer’s hardware or software configuration. If you have appropriate baselines, you can determine which resources are affecting your computer’s performance.

When you create a performance baseline for a computer, you cannot transfer that baseline to a computer configured with different hardware or software. Instead, you should create a performance baseline per client computer configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> You might have to recreate the baseline when you upgrade to a new version of Windows, because once it is upgraded with new features and security updates, the baseline performance of Windows might change.
