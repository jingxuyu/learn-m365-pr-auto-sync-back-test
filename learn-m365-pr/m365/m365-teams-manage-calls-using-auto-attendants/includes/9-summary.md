In your digital camera manufacturing company, users can call your help desks for technical support. You wanted to ensure that, when you moved the phone system to Microsoft Teams, you can implement phone menus and queuing systems to manage this process. Because Microsoft Phone System and Teams support auto attendants and call queues, you were able to recreate your previous on-premises call handling system in the cloud.

Without auto attendants and call queues, it's difficult to obtain information from a caller's keypad or present them with a menu of options. It's also hard to manage a large number of calls during busy times. Auto attendants and call queues are essential for many companies to handle communications with customers.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the differences between auto attendants and call queues.
- Design an auto attendant to gather information from callers.
- Explain how to set up auto attendants to implement your plan.
- Demonstrate how to plan call queues to manage many callers.
- Describe how to configure call queues to alert agents and route calls.
- Explain how to plan licensing for auto attendants and call queues.
