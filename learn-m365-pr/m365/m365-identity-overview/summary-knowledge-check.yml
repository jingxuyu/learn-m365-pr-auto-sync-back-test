    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Question: Why do today’s security analysts sometimes describe identity security as “the new control plane?"
      choices:
      - content: "In the time of mainframes and local identities, IT was not concerned about identity management, but with the advent of cloud computing it’s become significant."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "IT has always been concerned with identity security. Cloud computing and proliferation of mobile devices have made identity and access control critical."
      - content: "Before cloud computing, all user credentials resided on-premises; now they all live in a public cloud."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Not all organizations store user credentials in a public cloud. Regardless of where credentials reside, passwords are not the most reliable protection against network breaches."
      - content: "Unlike the days of single organizational identities, workers today use many devices and cloud apps with multiple identities and passwords."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "As users now access data through multiple devices and identities, the network perimeter is no longer the first line of defense."
    - content: "Why is user identity vulnerable to attacks in today’s digital landscape?"
      choices:
      - content: "Sophisticated attackers can exploit software vulnerabilities by inserting malicious code in webpages and thereby gain access to credentials stored on users’ devices."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Users don’t always store credentials on their devices, but smart hackers use social engineering techniques to trick users into divulging credentials."
      - content: "Because users access organization data through mobile devices and cloud apps, they must remember numerous passwords, and hackers can exploit this weakness."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Because users find it difficult to remember numerous personal and work passwords, they tend to use weak or duplicate passwords that are vulnerable to identity theft and brute force attacks."
      - content: "Most organizations now store workforce credentials in the cloud where they are increasingly vulnerable to attack."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Regardless of where credentials are stored, attackers target weak or duplicate passwords that are the most vulnerable to compromise."
    - content: "Which of these describes a modern identity and access management strategy?"
      choices:
      - content: "Protect internal and external user identity while improving user experience and productivity."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Users value productivity over identity protection and prefer a simple authentication experience."
      - content: "Prioritize hardening the on-premises network security perimeter while requiring periodic password changes."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Requiring regular password changes is best practice but it doesn’t fully address phishing attacks and the user experience."
      - content: "Create and enforce a single strong access policy for all users."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A modern access management strategy avoids a one-size-fits-all approach, preferring to customize policy based on user role and need to access."
