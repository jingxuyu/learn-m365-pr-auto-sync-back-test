Resilience is a critical component of Microsoft service availability, but even resilient services can be impacted by unexpected events. Microsoft’s Enterprise Business Continuity Management (EBCM) Program helps to ensure our online services are prepared to recover quickly from unexpected events using detailed, validated business continuity plans.

## EBCM team structure ##

The EBCM Program Management Office provides governance, oversight, and support for business continuity management (BCM) across Microsoft. The related Business Continuity Council of Microsoft senior management representatives is chartered to drive business continuity sponsorship, awareness, resource allocation, and program accountability across their respective business units. Together, these teams drive compliance with the Microsoft business continuity management (BCM) framework across the enterprise.

Each Microsoft business unit is required to comply with the objectives of the Microsoft EBCM program. To support EBCM objectives, each business unit designates a representative to lead and coordinate EBCM implementation activities within their business unit. This representative serves as the primary point of contact for all continuity and resilience issues. The EBCM Program Management Office maintains a database of all online services, including upstream and downstream dependencies, which serves as a central repository for business continuity information across our online services. It also records all relevant documentation, reviews, and testing dates. Service teams within Microsoft 365 are automatically notified when their EBCM documentation or processes need to be updated or tested.

The EBCM program is tightly aligned with Internal Audit and the Microsoft Enterprise Risk Organization (ERO). These teams use a programmatic and global approach to assess, manage, and establish accountability for the most critical risks facing Microsoft. EBCM works with the ERO team to ensure consistent alignment among risks and risk ratings. Additionally, EBCM collaborates with appropriate corporate functions, such as Real Estate Global Security (RE&S), to ensure a holistic approach to business response and incident management. EBCM coordination results in a tightly knit relationship among partner teams. The following list outlines the teams involved in EBCM activities related to  Microsoft 365:

- Enterprise Governance Risk & Compliance (EGRC) – Team responsible for enterprise-level reporting on risk/compliance and finding current Information Security Standards that align with the Microsoft Security Policy, implementation procedures, and recognized industry standards. Manages overall risk for Microsoft, including risks associated with EBCM.
- EBCM Program Management Office – Team responsible for managing the Microsoft EBCM program, including EBCM standards, policy, training, and metrics.
- Business Continuity Council – Senior representatives from each business/engineering function, such as Microsoft 365, who collaborate on cross-group plans and overall policy.
- Business Continuity Champions – Individuals from each service team, such as Exchange Online or Microsoft Teams, who lead Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) efforts for their service team.
- Workload DevOps – Engineers within product groups that are responsible for day-to-day operations and live site issues (incident managers, on-call engineers), including BCDR responsibilities.
- Microsoft 365 Incident Communication and Coordination – Microsoft 365 team that functions as a central hub for internal and external communication during an incident of Microsoft 365 Services.
- Customer Service and Support – Team responsible for handling customer-reported issues. Serves as a first point of contact for customers in the event of a disaster.

## BCM framework ##

In addition to facilitating cooperation on business continuity, Microsoft’s EBCM program provides a consistent BCM framework that is implemented by business units across the enterprise. This framework addresses the recovery and continuity of critical business functions, services, and data required to maintain an acceptable level of operations during an incident. Use of a common framework ensures the existence of effective, reliable, well-tested plans, systems, and processes which can be counted on to support business continuity and minimize adverse impacts during a disruptive event.

Specific objectives of the BCM framework include:

- Integrating enterprise-level risk analysis to support informed business decisions on risk tolerance, avoidance, and mitigation.
- Implementing proven methodologies to assist business areas in resuming their business operations quickly, cost-effectively, and with minimal impact on customers.

## BCM lifecycle ##

At the core of our BCM methodology is the BCM lifecycle. This process is designed to be adaptable so it can be implemented by a wide variety of business models across Microsoft. The phases of the BCM lifecycle guide each business unit at Microsoft through developing and implementing effective business continuity plans.

The BCM lifecycle is comprised of three high-level phases. It begins with an initial **Assessment**, which involves identifying critical processes and objectives that should be included in the business continuity program. The **Planning** phase focuses on developing and implementing resilience and recovery strategies, as well as documenting them in official business continuity plans. Finally, **Capability Validation** tests business continuity plans and their implementations to verify effectiveness and identify improvements.
