When looking for a partner to assist you with the FastTrack process, you should begin by accessing the [I’m looking for a solution provider](https://www.microsoft.com/solution-providers/home?azure-portal=true) website.

To locate a solution provider, enter your city, organization size, and the services, skills, or products you need assistance with. The website will then display a list of partner candidates that you can choose from. Each partner will be broken down in categories. Once you have made your selection, the partner will contact you and start the onboarding process.

When the onboarding process is complete, you can see your partner’s information in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Navigate to the Partner Services tab, which is located under the Settings tab in the left-hand navigation pane.
