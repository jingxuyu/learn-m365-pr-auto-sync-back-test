Permission management is an essential task for any messaging administrator. Exchange Server and Exchange Online both use the same permission model that was originally introduced in Exchange 2010 called Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

This module examines how RBAC enables you to control what administrators and end users can do at both broad and granular levels. You'll also learn how RBAC enables you to closely align the roles you assign users and administrators to the actual roles they hold within your organization.

This module examines the basics of administrator roles that are managed through RBAC. Management role groups associate management roles to a group of administrators or specialist users that need to complete administrative tasks. You'll learn how to add or remove users to or from role groups. This process is how you most often assign permissions to administrators or specialist users.

You'll then be introduced to the built-in role groups provided in Exchange. Each group provides permissions to manage specific areas in Exchange. You'll also learn how to create custom management role groups. Custom groups may be necessary if the built-in RBAC management role groups don't provide sufficient permissions for all your company job roles.

The module concludes with a review of how to troubleshoot RBAC management roles. You'll examine the steps necessary to troubleshoot permission issues related to RBAC roles and role groups in Exchange.
