  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Allan Deyoung wants to use Exchange Online PowerShell to create a Safe Links policy. What's the first thing Allan should do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the New-SafeLinksRule cmdlet to create a Safe Links rule"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the first thing Allan should do. Try again."
    - content: "Use the New-SafeLinksPolicy cmdlet to create a Safe Links policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When using PowerShell to create a policy, you must create the policy before the rule. The policy must be created first so that you can later assign it to the rule. If you create the rule first, you won't have a policy to assign to it."
    - content: "Use the Set-SafeLinksPolicy cmdlet to update the Safe Links policy settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the first thing Allan should do. Try again."
  - content: "What does URL detonation do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Protects users in the event a URL points to a malicious file on a web site"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. URL detonation combines elements of Safe Links and Safe Attachments into a single feature. This feature is designed to protect users in the event a URL points to a malicious file on a web site."
    - content: "If the URL is malicious, it redirects the user to a secure server where the site can be safely viewed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what URL detonation does. Try again."
    - content: "If the URL is malicious, it quarantines the URL so that any future links to that URL blow up and return an error"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what URL detonation does. Try again."
