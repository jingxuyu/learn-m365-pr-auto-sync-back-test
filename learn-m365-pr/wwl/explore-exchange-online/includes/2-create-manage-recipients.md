Exchange Online provides a range of recipient types that enable organizations to work more effectively and maintain details in one place, the Exchange Global Address List (GAL). The GAL can be accessed in Outlook and Outlook on the web. The following recipient types are the most commonly used types in Exchange Online.

  :::column:::
    

Most common form of a globally available distribution list for sending out one-to-many e-mail messages. Also applies when the membership list must be used elsewhere, such as determining who Transport Rules should apply to. In some use-cases, distribution groups can be used for contacting a team as a contact address, or to allow send-as another email alias without creating a shared mailbox.

  :::column:::
    

Distribute messages and provide access to resources to a set of users.


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Used when you need to apply permissions to resources such as a shared mailbox or Public Folder. Can also be used as a distribution group, and be used outside Exchange Online, such as in SharePoint Online.

  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Excellent for team or department collaboration when other resources such as OneNote or OneDrive are needed. Because it provides hooks into multiple Microsoft 365 services, it can be used as a tool to aid adoption and drive business value.

Mail contacts


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

Mail contacts don't have a user account in Microsoft 365. As such, they can't sign in.

These folders are Active Directory universal security group objects that have an assigned email address, which enables them to receive email messages.


  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    

These folders can be used to assign access permissions to resources in Active Directory and can also be used to distribute messages.

### Recipient types in a synchronized environment

If your Microsoft 365 environment doesn't use directory synchronization, your environment will use cloud IDs for Exchange Online only. This design enables you to create, modify, and delete all recipient types in Microsoft 365 using the Microsoft 365 admin center, Exchange admin center, or Windows PowerShell.

When you implement directory synchronization to your Microsoft 365 tenant (that is, you install Azure AD Connect to synchronize your local Active Directory), you must complete all recipient management tasks locally. In doing so, you must use on-premises Exchange management tools such as the Exchange Admin Center or Exchange Management Shell to create, modify, or delete recipients.
