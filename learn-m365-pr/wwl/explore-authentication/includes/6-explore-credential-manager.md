Windows includes Credential Manager which helps manage and maintain passwords. The Credential Manager utility is built into Windows Control Panel. Credential Manager saves credentials users enter when accessing other computers and resources on local networks, and it can also be used to backup and restore these credentials.

Consider a scenario where you access another computer in a workgroup every day. It would be time consuming to continually enter in your credentials when you access that other computer. Credential Manager can save those credentials so that you are not prompted each time you access other computers or websites. Credential Manager is enabled by default on non-domain computers. Web Credentials is the web component of Credential Manager and it remembers web login passwords.

## How to use Credential Manager

1.  Open the Windows **Control Panel**. Select **User Accounts**
2.  Choose to manage either Web Credentials or Windows Credentials.
3.  Select the expansion next to a credential.
4.  You can **Edit** or **Remove** the credential

You can select **Back up Credentials** to backup your saved credentials to another file. Restore is just the opposite of that process. You can add Windows Credentials as you see here by typing in an internet or network address, username and password. You can also add generic credentials such as this Microsoft user account.
