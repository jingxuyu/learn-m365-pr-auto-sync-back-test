Once you finished planning your directory synchronization implementation, you're ready to deploy the selected directory synchronization tool to your environment. As you may recall, the prior module introduced you to the two directory synchronization tools that you must choose from - Azure AD Connect and Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync.

In this module, you'll examine the prerequisites to installing each tool. You'll then examine the options for installing and configuring each tool. For Azure AD Connect, you also learn how to monitor its synchronization services using Azure AD Connect health.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Configure Azure AD Connect prerequisites.
 -  Install and configure Azure AD Connect.
 -  Monitor the Azure AD Connect synchronization services using Azure AD Connect Health.
 -  Configure Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync prerequisites.
 -  Install and configure Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync.
