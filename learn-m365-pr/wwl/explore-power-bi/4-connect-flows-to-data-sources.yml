  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Power BI Desktop supports multiple methods for connecting to data. In which method does Power BI Desktop query the underlying data source whenever a user creates or interacts with a visualization, which ensures the data being viewed is always current?"
    choices:
    - content: "Import"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With this method, the selected tables and columns from the data source are imported into Power BI Desktop."
    - content: "Live Connection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With this method, a user connects to a dataset that's been shared/published to the Power BI service to create new reports."
    - content: "DirectQuery"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. No data is imported or copied into Power BI Desktop when using DirectQuery. Instead, as the user creates or interacts with a visualization, Power BI Desktop queries the underlying data source. As a result, the data being viewed is always current."
