One of an administrator's priorities is to ensure that end users have access to the apps they need to do their work. This goal can be a challenge because:

 -  There are a wide range of device platforms and app types.
 -  Apps may need to be managed on both company devices and users' personal devices.
 -  Your network and your data must remain secure.

This module examines how to use Microsoft Intune to manage mobile applications. You'll learn how organizations can use Intune to configure specific policies to control applications. For example, it can prevent emails from being sent to people outside the organization. App protection policies are rules that ensure an organization's data remains safe or contained in a managed app. A policy can be a rule that is enforced when the user attempts to access or move "corporate" data, or a set of actions that are prohibited or monitored when the user is inside the app.

The module will explore how to add apps to Intune so that organizations can configure, assign, protect, and monitor them. You'll examine various app requirements that are needed by users at an organization. You'll also learn how to determine whether to use Intune to manage the devices (including apps), or have Intune manage the apps without managing the devices.

The module will then explore how mobile application management in Intune is configured by using app protection policies. These policies can be applied to Windows 10 and later devices, plus Android and iOS devices. You'll examine the benefits of using app protection policies, and you'll learn how data is protected with these policies.

To help organizations eliminate app setup problems, you'll learn how organizations can use app configuration policies. These policies let organizations assign configuration settings to a policy that's assigned to end-users before they run the app. The key aspect of this feature is the fact that settings are supplied automatically when the app is configured on the end-users' devices. As such, the end-users don't need to take action.

The module concludes by examining basic troubleshooting techniques when deploying app protection policies in Intune. The training is designed to cover basic, high-level steps that administrators should be familiar with to properly troubleshoot policy deployment issues.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the basic functionality of mobile application management in Microsoft Intune.
 -  Assess your app requirements and add apps into Intune.
 -  Protect company data by using app protection policies.
 -  Implement app configuration policies in Intune to eliminate app setup problems.
 -  Troubleshoot app protection policy deployment in Intune.
