Threats are the potential weakness that attackers can use to infiltrate your organization. Attackers will cross multiple domains like email, identity, endpoints, and applications to find a point of least resistance.

Today's defense solutions have been designed to protect, detect, and block threats for each domain separately, allowing attackers to exploit the seams and threshold differences between solutionsâ€”leaving the business vulnerable to attack. While one facet of an attack may be caught and blocked in email, the same threat actor may have also compromised identities by exploiting weak passwords or leaked credentials, or by fooling people into providing their passwords or authorization tokens. It's also possible for point solutions to overlook critical signals entirely because, in isolation, they failed to register as significant.
