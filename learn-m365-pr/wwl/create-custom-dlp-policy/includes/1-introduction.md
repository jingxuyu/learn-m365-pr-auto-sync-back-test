Microsoft provides built-in policy templates within Microsoft 365 to help organizations get started with implementing DLP policies. However, some businesses require custom policies that are more aligned with their unique requirements.

There are several things an organization can do to customize a policy based on a built-in template, such as:

 -  Changing the content locations
 -  Adding a new rule
 -  Deleting a rule
 -  Editing a rule

Organizations can also create a custom policy from scratch.

In this module, you'll customize a policy created with a policy template by editing one of the policyâ€™s rules. The process of editing an existing rule and the process of adding a new rule are similar, since both procedures configure the following properties:

 -  Name
 -  Conditions
 -  Exceptions
 -  Actions
 -  User notifications
 -  User overrides
 -  Incident reports

> [!NOTE]
> User notifications, user overrides, and sending incident reports can also be considered actions. However, they're examined in separate units within this module.

After completing this module, you' be able to:

 -  Describe how to modify existing rules of DLP policies.
 -  Explain how to add and modify custom conditions and action to a DLP rule.
 -  Describe how to change user notifications and policy tips.
 -  Configure the user override option to a DLP rule.
 -  Explain how incident reports are sent by a DLP rule violation.
