## SharePoint Online

SharePoint Online is the cloud evolution of Microsoft SharePoint Server. It's a cloud service that enables you to store, organize, and add third-party apps, access information from almost any device, and allow sharing with external people by default, all by using a web-browser. It helps you create team or communication-focused sites for efficient collaboration and communication. Internal users with an appropriate Microsoft 365 or SharePoint Online license can use SharePoint Online. They can share files or folders with others inside or outside the organization. Sharing outside the organization can be controlled by site administrators.

With SharePoint Online, users:

- Build sites and pages, document libraries, and lists.
- Add web parts to customize their pages.
- Share important visuals, news, and updates with a team. or more broadly.
- Search and discover sites, files, people, and news from across their organization.
- Manage their business processes with flows, forms, and lists.
- Co-author documents with other users.
- Sync and store their files in the cloud so anyone can securely work with them.
- Catch up on news on-the-go with the SharePoint mobile app.
