Often times, regular uses of System Center Configuration Manager overlook how much they can use Conditional Access (CA) and take advantage of the simple, cloud-attached benefits.

Conditional Access is a powerful service, which ensures that corporate resources are only accessed by trusted users on trusted devices using trusted apps. It has been built from scratch for the cloud and, whether you’re managing devices with Intune or extending your Configuration Manager deployment with co-management, it works the same way.

With co-management, Intune evaluates every device in your network to determine how trustworthy it is – and it does so in two important ways:

1. Intune ensures a device or app is managed and secure, based on any way you choose to set your organization’s compliance policies (for example, make sure all devices have encryption enabled and are not jailbroken).

1. Intune detects active security incidents on a device thanks to the intelligent security of Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection and other mobile threat defense providers.

Conditional Access also provides you with a centralized place to see the health of all network-connected devices, and you get the advantages of cloud scale – which is especially valuable for testing ConfigMgr production instances.
