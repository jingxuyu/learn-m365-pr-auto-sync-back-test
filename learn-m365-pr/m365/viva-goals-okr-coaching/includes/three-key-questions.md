There are three questions that you can use in your toolkit as an OKR coach.  If you remember anything from this module, remember these three questions.  Write them down, speak them verbally, do whatever it takes for you to remember.  They will be the greatest resource at your disposal as an OKR coach.

*Objective question:*

**What is the most important area of our business that we need to focus on?**

*Key result question:*

**How will we know we were successful?**

*Project question:*

**What do we need to do to be successful?**

These three questions are a starting point to the conversation that an individual or team should have to develop great OKRs.

You should ask these questions in the order showcased above, only moving onto the next one once the output of the conversation (the objective or set of key results) has passed the rubrics we will cover in a later section.

As mentioned above, these questions are a starting point for the conversation. OKR coaches will often need to ask follow-up questions to help the team reach clear answers. We will cover these follow-up questions in more detail in our subsequent sections, but we have also consolidated many of the common ones into a cheat sheet below.

We recommend using this cheat sheet as a reference throughout the upcoming scenarios to solidify your learning and understanding.
