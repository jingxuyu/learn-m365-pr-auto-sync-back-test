When companies consider cloud solutions, they usually focus on three areas: 

- Cost
- Security/reliability and compliance
- Functionality 

These three categories aren’t necessarily equally important. Some smaller companies might favor lower cost over functionality, while larger, more complex companies might have security and compliance as their top priority. 

In terms of an operational activities, the following circumstances can help you choose the best model for your organization:

- **Recent investment in hardware.** A year ago a medium-sized company invested in new hardware for their on-premises datacenter. They likely won’t be interested in any major shift to the cloud for at least a year or two. Companies in a similar situation will likely opt for a limited hybrid cloud model that focuses on providing functionalities they lack in their local datacenter. 
- **Outdated hardware and systems.** In contrast to the previous example, a company that’s considering a local datacenter renewal versus cloud-based solutions can have a very different perspective. If their datacenter has old hardware and unsupported versions of software, they’ll be more likely to consider moving to the cloud. And, if the cloud offering meets their security and compliance requirements, the relative cost and the type of cost model (OpEx vs. CapEx) will probably be the deciding factors. 
- **Limited in-house IT resources**. The size and skillset of your IT department is a significant factor when considering whther to move to a cloud-based solution. Often a company with limited IT resources moves more quickly to cloud services because they don't need IT hardware and software maintenance. Some companies with larger IT organizations might also consider the cloud as a way to free their IT resources to focus on more strategic functions, thus adding value to the organization. 
- **Available capital**. Cloud-based software-as-a-service solutions are designed to help organizations avoid large upfront capital investments in IT - instead you pay for access to software over time using a subscription model. If your organization has limited capital for IT or has other priorities for capital investment, then choosing the cloud might be the best choice.
