Organizations typically make additional customizations to the device to help provide the best user experience. Examples of this may be choosing what options are available in the Start menu or ensuring that a laptop's power settings are configured to optimize battery life. While these customizations can be completed by the end user, they aren't always aware of these capabilities or know how to perform them. Furthermore, there may be default features or functions that organizations may want to hide, as they may either cause distractions, or may confuse the user as to which option to choose.<br>
