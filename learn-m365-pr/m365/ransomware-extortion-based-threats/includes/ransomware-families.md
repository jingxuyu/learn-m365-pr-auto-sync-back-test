Ransomware has now developed into a complete business model called ransomware-as-a-service where cybercriminals license out “off-the-shelf” products. Just like a family, these products share common characteristics that make them recognizable to anti-malware security solutions. In September 2021, in an analysis of more than 12.7 million malware detections made by a key antivirus company, more than 220 ransomware families were identified.

The top 10 families will change, but some notable ones are:

- WannaCryptor
- Stop/DJVU
- Conti
- REvil

### WannaCryptor

The following key facts are known about WannaCryptor:

- It targets Windows operating devices.
- It demands payment via Bitcoin.
- It relies on vulnerabilities in the system to gain access.
- It's known as a crypto worm because when it gets inside a system, it can spread by itself.
- In 2017, it was part of a global attack that brought disruption to more than 185,000 devices across 100 countries.
- It's also known as Wannacrypt, Wanna Decryptor, Wana Decrypt0r 2.0, and WanaCrypt0r 2.0.
- It's believed to have originated in North Korea.

### Stop/DJVU

The following key facts are known about Stop/DJVU:

- It's introduced to a system, either via spam email or by taking advantage of software vulnerabilities.
- When it’s introduced, it will run a file that loads the software onto your device to target documents, spreadsheets, images, videos, databases, and other similar data. It then blocks access to the files and demands a ransom.
- Stop/DJVU is also known as STOP Ransomware, STOP (DJVU), or DJVU virus, and has 374 active variants.
- It mainly targets Windows operating systems.
- It's extremely difficult to decrypt files infected with this ransomware.

It isn't known which country or countries the cybercriminals work from.

### Conti

The following key facts are known about Conti:

- Its main target is hospitals and healthcare organizations.
- It targets files vital for the running of the organization, putting lives at risk while the systems are down.
- The average ransom is $850,000.
- As well as the installation of the ransomware, it also installs other malware to steal data.
- The ransom for stolen data can sometimes be more than the worth of the original data.
- The virus enters the system via phishing emails with attachments. When an attachment is opened, the virus runs and encrypts the system.

### REvil

The following key facts are known about the REvil group:

- REvil are a group of ransomware hackers also known by the name Sodinokibi.
- It's understood that most of its members are Russian or from former Soviet Union countries.
- The ransom demands have been getting increasingly larger as they become more targeted in their approach.
- They've announced that the agricultural sector is going to be a major target for this group.
- They often threaten to auction off data if ransom demands aren't met.
- REvil operate under the ransomware-as-a-service licensing model.
- If demands aren't met, they threaten to post sensitive documents on its website, known as the “Happy Blog”.
- In 2019, they were linked to 24 local government attacks in Texas.
- Despite a high-profile announcement that agencies in Russia had shut down the group, there are still reports of attacks using that name.

In 2021, two high-profile attacks by the REvil and DarkSide ransomware families were reported in the media.

## Case study 1 – meat processing company

The following outlines the attack:

- In June 2021, the **target** was a major US meat packing corporation.
- The **attackers**, the REvil group, downloaded malicious code that affected operations in Australia and North America, and was described as very sophisticated.
- The **impact** on the company involved halting cattle slaughtering in all US plants and suspending food production in Australia and North America.
- To **resolve the situation**, the company paid a $11 million Bitcoin ransom, stating they had done so to protect customers.

The government response:

- The scale of the attack prompted the United States to act and offer a reward of up to $10 million for any information that would lead to the cybercriminals arrest.
- In an act of cooperation, the Russian intelligence bureau arrested the group and seized more than $560,000 of crypto currency and more than 20 premium cars bought with the “proceeds of crime”.
- The ransomware did disappear for a while but has since reemerged and once again is a major threat.

## Case study 2 – major fuel distribution company

The following outlines the attack:

- In April  2021, the **target** was a major oil distribution plant.
- The **attackers**, the DarkSide group, downloaded malicious code that affected the company’s network on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.
- **The impact** of the attack hit companies and drivers as fuel deliveries were halted, leading to panic buying throughout the affected area.
- To **resolve the situation**, the fuel distribution company paid a Bitcoin ransom of $4.4 million, stating that they didn’t know the extent of the intrusion, or how long it would take to restore operations.

The government response:

US investigators recovered millions in cryptocurrency as they targeted DarkSide, the company responsible for the attack. It was later revealed that DarkSide had been under surveillance for more than a year and the fuel distribution company were following the investigators’ instructions so they could track the ransom payment to a cryptocurrency wallet used by the hackers. Despite this government success, the DarkSide ransomware is still active and affecting other users.
