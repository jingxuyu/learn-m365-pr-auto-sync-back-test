What if your company is large and has invested heavily in on-premises hardware, line-of-business systems, custom apps, and so on? Do you have to abandon all of your resources and customizations to gain the benefits of cloud computing? Certainly not.

A *hybrid cloud* migration lets you keep critical resources on-premises while also working with cloud services. Many enterprises embrace this model because it connects on-premises resources to the cloud, effectively making the new cloud services an extension of your on-premises infrastructure. The hybrid cloud model lets you extend capabilities or features that aren't available in your existing on-premises systems (like mobility and productivity) to your infrastructure.
