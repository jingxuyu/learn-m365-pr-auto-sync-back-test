This module explored how Microsoft 365 supports data governance. It examined the tools Microsoft 365 provides to import, store, preserve, retire, and expire data as it leaves an organization's data retention windows.

The module began by exploring how archive mailboxes are used to manage the retention of mail items that organizations must keep, and the removal of mail items they don't want to keep. When an administrator enables the user’s mailbox for archiving, another mailbox is created and displayed in the user’s Outlook and Outlook on the web. This new mailbox is the archive mailbox. Mail from the primary mailbox can then be moved in various ways to the archive mailbox.

You learned that when an archive mailbox is enabled, the default retention policy automatically moves:

 -  Items that are two years or older from a user’s primary mailbox to the user’s archive mailbox.
 -  Items that are 14 days or older from the Recoverable Items folder in the user's primary mailbox to the Recoverable Items folder in the user’s archive mailbox.

You also learned how to enable and disable an archive mailbox using both the Microsoft Purview compliance portal and Windows PowerShell. The module also provided instruction on how to run diagnostic test on the archive mailbox. This process enables organizations to quickly diagnose and resolve issues in Exchange Online and Outlook.

You then examined how organizations use records management in Microsoft 365 to manage their high-value content for legal, business, or regulatory obligations. You were provided with documentation links that support various records management tasks. You also learned about the declaration of records and regulatory records and what actions are allowed or blocked by each type. In later training, you'll examine the use of retention tags, policies, and labels to further support records management.

The module concluded by examining how to restore deleted data in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online. You learned the restoration process of deleted Exchange Online data is a two step process - recover the deleted data and then restore the recovered data. You also learned that restoring deleted data in SharePoint Online involves two recycle bins - the Site recycle bin and the Site Collection recycle bin.
