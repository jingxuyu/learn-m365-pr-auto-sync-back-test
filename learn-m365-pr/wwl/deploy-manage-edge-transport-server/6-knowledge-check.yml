    - content: "The computer running the Edge Transport server doesn't require an FQDN"
      isCorrect: false

    - content: "Active Directory communications shouldn't be allowed through the firewall that protects the internal network from the perimeter network"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Active Directory communications shouldn't be allowed through the firewall that protects the internal network from the perimeter network. Doing so can cause security issues, such as allowing an unauthorized user to retrieve your email addresses directly from Active Directory and then use them for spam."
