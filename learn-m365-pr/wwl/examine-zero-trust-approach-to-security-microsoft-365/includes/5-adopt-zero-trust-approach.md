Organizations should adopt a Zero Trust approach to security protection to meet today’s most challenging security demands. This approach covers four key areas: Identity, Security, Compliance, and Skilling.

### 1. Identity: The starting point of a Zero Trust approach.

Adopting a Zero Trust strategy is a journey. Every single step your organization takes will make it more secure. In today’s world, with disappearing corporate network perimeters, identity is an organization's first line of defense. While each organization's Zero Trust journey will be unique, if you're wondering where to start, Microsoft recommends that you start with a strong cloud identity foundation. The most fundamental steps like strong authentication, protecting user credentials, and protecting devices are the most essential.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft's cloud identity solution, provides the following features that can help organizations on their Zero Trust journey:

 -  **Passwordless authentication**. This feature eliminates one of the weakest links in security today. It's now generally available for cloud and hybrid environments. Passwordless authentication creates a complete experience for all employees, so they no longer need passwords to sign in to the network. Instead, Azure AD now lets them sign in with biometrics or a tap using Windows Hello for Business, the Microsoft Authenticator app, or a compatible FIDO2 security key from Microsoft Intelligent Security Association partners such as Yubico, Feitian, and AuthenTrend. With Temporary Access Pass, you can generate a time-limited code to set up or recover a passwordless credential.
 -  **Azure AD Conditional Access**. This feature is the policy engine at the heart of Microsoft's Zero Trust solution. It uses authentication context to enforce even more granular policies based on user actions within the app they're using or sensitivity of data they're trying to access. This design helps organizations protect important information without unduly restricting access to less sensitive content.
 -  **Azure AD verifiable credentials**. Verifiable credentials let organizations confirm information—like their education or the professional certifications someone provides—without collecting and storing their personal data. This design improves security and privacy. Microsoft's partnerships that integrate Azure AD verifiable credentials with leading identity verification providers will also improve verifiability and secure information exchange.

### 2. Security: Simplifying the “assume breach” toolset.

In today’s landscape, an organization's security approach should start with the key Zero Trust principle of assume breach. But too often, complexity and fragmentation stand in the way. Microsoft is committed to helping you solve these issues, as it builds security for all, delivered from the cloud.

This commitment begins with integrated solutions that let organizations focus on what matters and deliver visibility across all their platforms and all their clouds. Some vendors deliver endpoint or email protection. Others deliver Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools. Integrating these pieces together can be a time-consuming challenge. Microsoft takes a holistic approach that combines best-of-breed SIEM and extended detection and response (XDR) tools built from the ground up in the cloud to improve your posture, protection, and response. This design gives organizations the best-of-breed combined with the best-of-integration so they don’t have to compromise.

Microsoft provides the following features to simplify the experience for defenders with modern and integrated capabilities:

 -  Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender for Office 365 customers can investigate and remediate threats from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. It provides unified alerts, user and investigation pages for deep, automated analysis and simple visualization. It also provides a new Learning Hub where customers can use instructional resources with best practices and how-tos.
 -  Incidents, schema, and user experiences are now common between Microsoft 365 Defender and Azure Sentinel. Microsoft continues to expand connectors for Azure Sentinel and work to simplify data ingestion and automation.
 -  Threat Analytics provides a set of reports from expert Microsoft security researchers that help you understand, prevent, and mitigate active threats, like the Solorigate attacks, directly within Microsoft 365 Defender.
 -  Microsoft has brought Secured-core to Windows Server and edge devices to help minimize risk from firmware vulnerabilities and advanced malware in IoT and hybrid cloud environments.

Microsoft continues and strengthens its commitment to deliver state-of-the-art protection, detection, and response for all clouds and all platforms. One such solution it provides is Defender for Endpoint, which is available for Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows. Microsoft also provides Azure Sentinel, which looks across your multi-cloud environments, including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Salesforce service cloud, VMware, and Cisco Umbrella.<br>

### 3. Compliance: Protection from the inside out.

At Microsoft, Zero Trust isn't only the practice of protecting against *outside-in* threats, but also protecting from the *inside out*. Addressing the area of compliance includes managing risks related to data. This data is more than just the data stored in the Microsoft cloud. It also includes the data from across the breadth of clouds and platforms an organization uses. Microsoft has invested in creating that inside-out protection by extending its capabilities to third parties to help organizations reduce risk across their entire digital estate.

Microsoft provides the following new innovations in compliance:

 -  Coauthoring of documents protected with Microsoft Information Protection. This feature enables multiple users to work simultaneously on protected documents while taking advantage of the intelligent, unified, and extensible protection for documents and emails across Microsoft 365 apps.
 -  Microsoft 365 Insider Risk Management Analytics, which can identify potential insider risk activity within an organization and help inform policy configurations. With one selection, a customer can have the system run a daily scan of its tenant audit logs, including historical activity, and use Microsoft 365’s Insider Risk Management machine learning engine to identify potential risky activity with privacy built-in by design.
 -  Microsoft 365 now offers data loss prevention (DLP) for Chrome browsers and on-premises server-based environments such as file shares and SharePoint Server.
 -  Azure Purview is integrated with Microsoft Information Protection. Thsi design enables organizations to apply the same sensitivity labels defined in Microsoft 365 Compliance Center to data that's stored in other clouds or on-premises. With Azure Purview, a unified data governance solution for on-premises, multi-cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) data, organizations can scan and classify data located in AWS Simple Storage Services (S3), SAP ECC, SAP S4/HANA, and Oracle Database.

### 4. Skilling: Power your future through security skilling.

Many organizations continue to struggle to fill the security skills gap. That’s why Microsoft strives to ensure organizations have the skilling and learning resources they need to keep up in today's world of complex cybersecurity attacks. Microsoft provides two different ways of helping organizations skill cybersecurity professionals.

First, Microsoft has four new security, compliance, and identity certifications tailored to organizations' roles and needs:

 -  **Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**. This certification helps individuals get familiar with the fundamentals of security, compliance, and identity across cloud-based and related Microsoft services.
 -  **Information Protection Administrator Associate**. This certification focuses on planning and implementing controls that meet organizational compliance needs.
 -  **Security Operations Analyst Associate**. This certification helps security operational professionals design threat protection and response systems.
 -  **Identity and Access Administrator Associate**. This certification help individuals design, implement, and operate an organization’s identity and access management systems by using Azure Active Directory.

While today's world is complex, growing your skills shouldn’t be.
