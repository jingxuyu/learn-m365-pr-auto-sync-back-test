Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels provide a simple way for your users to classify critical content in Power BI without compromising productivity or the ability to collaborate.

Sensitivity labels can be applied to datasets, reports, dashboards, and dataflows. When labeled data leaves Power BI, either via export to Excel, PowerPoint or PDF files, or via other supported export scenarios such as Analyze in Excel or live connection PivotTables in Excel, Power BI automatically applies the label to the exported file and protects it according to the label’s file encryption settings. This way your sensitive data remains protected, no matter where it is.

Power BI is the only BI product in the industry to support [Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-security-sensitivity-label-overview), helping enterprises classify content in Power BI and protect it even as data is exported to Excel, PowerPoint and PDF files. Power BI is adding support for:

- Power BI dataset MIP sensitivity label applied on Excel file when using live connect Excel automatically inherits the sensitivity label from Power BI when a user directly connects a PivotTable to a Power BI dataset. Label changes will also be updated automatically upon data refresh.

- MIP sensitivity labels in Power BI desktop – Expanded support for MIP sensitivity labels support to Power BI desktop, to enable creators to apply sensitivity labels and protection on PBIX files while author dataset and reports in Power BI desktop. The label applied in desktop will persist upon publish dataset and report.
