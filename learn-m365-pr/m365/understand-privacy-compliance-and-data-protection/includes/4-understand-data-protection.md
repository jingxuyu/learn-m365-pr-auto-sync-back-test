When running services and storing data in the cloud, you should follow the standard best practices for security, just as you would on any on-premises network: 
- Always use strong passwords and ensure the passwords are changed regularly.  
- Always grant the minimum set rights and permissions to resources and review them on a regular basis. However, because data consists of confidential information, you should consider using encryption.  
- Perform regular auditing and monitoring. 
When considering protection for data in the cloud, explore how to best protect your data both where it’s stored, and when it’s being used or transmitted: 
- For data that is at rest (sitting on a disk somewhere in the cloud), you should encrypt the disks or files on the disks. Office 365 Data Loss Protection and Azure Information Protection—both part of Microsoft 365—collectively offer end-to-end discovery, custom labeling, and automated protection of sensitive data, irrespective of when the data was created or where it is stored—even in PDFs and RMS-encrypted files. 
- When transmitting important data (data on the move) such as credit card or social security numbers, use HTTPS to encrypt the data.
