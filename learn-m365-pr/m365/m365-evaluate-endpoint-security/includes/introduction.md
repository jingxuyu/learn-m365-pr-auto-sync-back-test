Imagine you're the security analyst for a large organization. You need to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the protection measures for the devices across your organization, so that you can monitor and improve the security of your devices, however, performing a comprehensive evaluation of your endpoint security product can be complex and time consuming. This is because you need to have the right configurations in place across your devices, to simulate specific scenarios, and you need to monitor and review important information to gain insights. In this module, you'll learn how you can use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's evaluation lab to evaluate the capabilities of the product _without_ the traditional setup and configuration difficulties.

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the evaluation lab
- Understand the simulation gallery
- Understand attack simulation scenarios
