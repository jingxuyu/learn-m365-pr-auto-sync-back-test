**Scenario:** Suppose you're an IT admin who oversees your company or school’s intranet. Management is looking for ways to reduce support costs while also increasing productivity. Your boss tasks you with finding a way to improve your organization’s search experience. With the current search solution, many users complain it's often difficult and time-consuming to find work info because it doesn’t index Microsoft 365 content. Also, you’ve been given a limited budget to implement a new solution.
