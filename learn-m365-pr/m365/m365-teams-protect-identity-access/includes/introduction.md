In the past, a username and password were considered enough to protect user accounts against malicious users and other security breaches. Today, administrators know weak passwords and poor security practices can compromise these credentials and prefer to use more checks to increase security without inconveniencing users. Microsoft Teams supports these extra measures.

Suppose you're an administrator for a large multinational organization with many users. Microsoft Teams comes with different features and capabilities you can use to protect your users' identities and access. You want to investigate these features and select the ones that most closely suit your needs.

In this module, you'll learn about simplifying access and identity, strengthening authentication, and managing endpoints to increase security in Teams.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to simplify access and identity provisioning in Microsoft Teams.
- Demonstrate how to strengthen authentication in Microsoft Teams.
- Explain how to manage Microsoft Teams endpoints.
