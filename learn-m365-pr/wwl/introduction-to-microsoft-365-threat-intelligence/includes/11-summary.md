In this module, you learned that one of the aspects of todayâ€™s cyberthreat landscape is its scale. The reach of cyberthreat tentacles is so widespread throughout an organization that it makes it hard to absorb the extensive and incessant pool of information, and then understand which information is most relevant among the noise.

You also learned that Microsoft 365 hosts one of the largest networks in the world and manages content created on millions of devices. Microsoft has built:

 -  a vast repository of threat intelligence data.
 -  the systems needed to spot patterns that correspond to attack behaviors and suspicious activity.

To proactively find and eliminate threats, Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence provides a collection of these insights. Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence is available with Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5. If your organization is using another Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription, Threat Intelligence can be purchased as an add-on.

In this module, you learned about the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph. This feature powers threat intelligence in Microsoft 365 by consuming billions of signals across the Microsoft 365 network from sources such as user activity, authentication, email, compromised PCs, and security incidents.<br>

You were also introduced to the two main features of threat intelligence in Microsoft 365, the Security Dashboard and Threat Explorer. These tools provide admins with evidence-based knowledge and actionable advice. Admins can use this information to make informed decisions about protecting and responding to cyber-attacks against their tenant.

This module also introduced you to Attack simulation training, which provides realistic attack scenarios to help organizations identify vulnerable users before a real attack happens. The goal of Attack simulation training is to make employees aware of various threat attacks and change their behavior so they learn what not to do when receiving email with links and attachments and so on.

The module concluded with an introduction to threat hunting in Microsoft Threat Protection and advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender. Threat hunting enables security operators to identify cybersecurity threats. Advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender proactively inspects events in your network using Kusto-based queries to locate threat indicators and entities.
