Knowing that you needed to move your organization's summit from in person to a virtual event gave you the focus to see how Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 could help.

You explored the different kinds of event options you have and the tools available to support each of them. You checked the platform requirements to let all your employees attend and engage with the summit. Microsoft 365 provides options for your Windows, Mac and Linux users, as well as to your Android and iOS users. You prepared for post event activities for your organizers, speakers, and attendees.

Microsoft 365 provides various tools and options for producing and attending your summit.  With each event, you are gaining confidence and building important skills for your organization.

Now that you've completed this module, you can:

- Describe the different virtual events supported by Microsoft 365
- Build accessible presentations to support your virtual events
- Choose the most appropriate tools for your virtual events
- Explain the different platform requirements
- Gather post-event insights for learning and improvement

## Next steps

```
TODO: I think it would be great to add links by role to the next module to read. 
For example, presenters will get the most from this module next, moderators this module? 
What do people think? This will only work once all modules have been written and we've identified the core audience for each module.
