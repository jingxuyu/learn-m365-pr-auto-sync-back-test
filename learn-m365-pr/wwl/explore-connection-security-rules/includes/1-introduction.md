Windows does not authenticate or encrypt connections made from one computer to another, by default. However, by configuring and using connection security rules, you can verify the identity of each computer that is communicating. You also can encrypt the connection between those computers, and then ensure that no tampering has occurred with respect to the transmission between the two computers.
