The data classification **Overview** page provides snapshots of how sensitive information and labels are being used in your organization. It displays the volume of sensitive data across Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. The view is categorized by sensitive information types, like US Social Security Number, Credit Card Number, and IP Address.

The **Overview** page can answer questions like: 
- What sensitive data is out there?

You can complete the following tasks in the overview section:
- Examine the volume and location of sensitive and business critical information.
- Monitor risky activities associated with sensitive information to inform DLP policies.
- Understand label utilization across Microsoft 365 to improve protection and governance policies.
