  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Patti Fernandez wants to create alert policies using the SCC. Patti must define a set of rules and conditions that define the user or admin activity that generates an alert. Next, Patti will identify the users who'll trigger the alert if they complete the activity. What's the final component of an alert policy that Patti must define?"
