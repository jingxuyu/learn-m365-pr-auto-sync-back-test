As you’ve learned, Microsoft Edge is built to be compatible with both modern and legacy websites through Internet Explorer mode. IE mode on Microsoft Edge makes it easy to use all of the sites your organization needs in a single browser.

Now that you’ve completed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to use Internet Explorer mode to enable legacy sites and line-of-business applications to run in Microsoft Edge.
- Configure Enterprise Mode Site List Manager to define the sites that will automatically run in IE mode.
- Enable enterprise mode in Microsoft Edge across the organization with group policy.
