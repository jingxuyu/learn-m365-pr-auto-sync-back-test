Exchange and SharePoint have become a reliable and common medium for communication and collaboration between information workers in organizations of all sizes. Mailboxes and document libraries have become repositories of valuable data. As a best practice, organizations should establish policies and provide guidelines to users about how to use messaging and document systems responsibly, including how data is stored. Organizations must also create policies to manage the life cycle of email and documents. These policies may require system administrators to:

 -  Keep messages and documents for a length of time based on business, legal, and regulatory requirements.
 -  Preserve mailbox data and documents for litigation and investigation purposes.
 -  Prepare to search for and provide the required messaging and document records to fulfill eDiscovery requests.
