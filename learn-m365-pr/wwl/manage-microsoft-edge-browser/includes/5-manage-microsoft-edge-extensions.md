When you use Microsoft Edge without any add-ons or modifications, most websites will display normally. Extensions are web add-ons that you can use to customize your browser. These are lightweight software components that extend the existing functionality, thereby improving the overall browsing experience. For example, you can use extensions to view, edit, and create Office files directly in the browser window, block unwanted ads, or translate webpages. These can be downloaded from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.

Microsoft and other software vendors have released extensions in various categories. Some of the categories of extensions include:

You can install extensions by performing the following steps:

1.  Open Microsoft Edge.
2.  On the **Settings and More** menu (the ellipsis, **...** , in the top-right corner), and select **Extensions**.
3.  In the **Extensions** dialog box, select **Open Microsoft Edge Add-ons**.
4.  In the **Edge Add-ons** site, select the extension that you want to install.

Microsoft distributed Chromium-based Edge to all Windows Update-connected devices running Windows 10 version 1803 and newer. With this update, Microsoft Edge now offers support for chromium based-extensions. This means chromium-based extensions can also be installed from other stores such as the Chrome Web Store.
