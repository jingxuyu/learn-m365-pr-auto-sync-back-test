To discover Viva Topics end-user experiences, use scenarios to help determine how you want to use Viva Topics. Scenarios are series of events projected to occur commonly, which can be automated in Viva Topics.

1. Identify your scenarios.
2. Prioritize the scenarios.
3. Implement high priority scenarios first.
4. Identify stakeholders.
5. Perform Topic discovery & curation.

## Step 1: Identify your scenarios

Here are several common scenarios where knowledge management and topics can help your organization.

- **Role onboarding & training**: Understanding a new organization's terminology, key projects, and culture are important steps in onboarding. Easy discovery of topics can help new employees ramp up on new jobs, roles, or projects quickly.
- **Expertise finding and information sharing**: When topics are managed and shared, people in your organizations can more easily find information and experts to help them in their work.
- **Expanded decision making and improved time to market**: When information and experts are easy to reach, you can make decisions more easily and shave time off projects.

## Step 2: Prioritize the scenarios

One way to prioritize them is to plot out your scenarios in a grid showing impact vs. ease of implementation. Look for scenarios that are high impact and easy to implement and make those your top priority. Low impact and hard-to-implement scenarios are your lowest priority. When you have a quick win with a high impact, easy-to-implement scenario, it helps people get excited and see the possibilities of using topics.

## Step 3: Implement high priority scenarios first

Pick a couple of key scenarios to focus on initially, work with your early adopters to get some feedback, and then roll out in stages. This way you can iterate, make improvements, and gain feedback to grow adoption over time.

## Step 4: Identify stakeholders

Identify the stakeholders for your project. The key roles are Executive sponsor, Success owner, and Champions.

In a larger organization, you might also have multiple people in these roles, and you'll need to coordinate them. In a smaller company, a single person might perform several of these roles. Different roles might be more involved in different phases of the project. For example, Tenant administrators are more involved in setting up the features, while Subject matter experts and Champions don't get involved until you start defining topics.  

We recommend having each of these roles fulfilled throughout your rollout, although you may find you don't require them all to get started with your identified solution.

|Role|Responsibility|Department|
|----|--------------|----------|
|Executive sponsor|Communicate high-level vision and values to the company|Executive leadership|
|Project lead|Oversee the entire launch execution and rollout process|Project management|
|Success owner|Creates the success plan and defines how success will be measured|Any department|
|Knowledge administrators|Set up and configure Viva Topics|IT department|
|Knowledge managers|Manage topics and oversee the category of Topics|Any department|
|Subject matter experts and topic contributors|Generate or review topics and descriptions|Any department|
|Champions|Help evangelize and manage objection handling|Any department (staff)|
|Tenant administrator|Configure tenant-level settings|IT department|
|Power Platform administrator|Configure common data services environment|IT department |
|Search administrator or manager|Configure search settings|IT department|

## Step 5: Perform Topic discovery & curation

Before you get started with adoption, you need to understand the concepts involved in Knowledge management and Viva Topics. The following diagram shows what happens during topic discovery and curation for your end users:

- **Discovery**: Users can discover knowledge in the apps they use every day through topic cards - they can also discover topics in Microsoft Search.
- **Curation**: Subject matter experts (SMEs) refine topics through topic pages, and AI learns from their input. The topic center contains topic pages users can explore, and experts can manage.
- **Identification**: With Microsoft Graph and Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge and people (topics, skills, and so on) are identified and automatically organized into related topics. SharePoint content is indexed with security content.
- **Extension**: With Microsoft Graph content connector*, you can ingest knowledge from external services and data repositories.

Keep in mind:

- Topic discovery is improved when more content is available.
- The security, privacy, and location of your data are preserved even though the information is presented in a new experience.
- Users need a license to view Viva Topics.
- Discovery is initially on English language content.

To help prepare, think through these questions:

- What content should be used for topic discovery?
- Who will manage topics?
- Who will see topic cards and highlights?
- Which topics are expected?

Review this list of prerequisites for getting the most out of Viva Topics:

|Product or feature|Description|
|------------------|-----------|
|SharePoint Online with modern SharePoint pages|Topic discovery only includes content on SharePoint sites, and topic cards can only be surfaced on modern pages.|
|Microsoft Graph|You can control whether topics are included or excluded from Search or Delve with the Microsoft Graph settings.|
