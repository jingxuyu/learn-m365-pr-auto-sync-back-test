Your technical director wants to ensure that the company’s devices are secure. Users at Woodgrove should see the benefit of applying updates to remain productive and stay current. Your manager wants you to produce a report on why Woodgrove should stay current, and how it can do so.

## Why your organization needs to stay current

Here are some of the important reasons why your organization needs to stay current:

### Security

If your organization doesn’t stay current with the latest updates, it could be more vulnerable to threats like:  
- **Ransomware**. Where an attacker encrypts folders and files, and attempts to extort your organization before you can regain access.
- **Exploits**. An attacker takes advantage of vulnerabilities in any of your applications and devices, then infects and accesses your organization’s wider environment.
- **Supply chain attacks**. An attacker accesses your organization’s source codes, and software build processes. It uses your applications to attack customers and their devices.

Security risks and threats could negatively affect your organization, and in some cases, severely impact your organization's finances and reputation. Keeping your organization current with the latest updates from Microsoft helps secure it against risks and threats. 

### Improve performance

If you don’t stay current, your environment’s various endpoints won’t receive updates that can help improve the quality and performance of the underlying operating system.  As a result, your overall environment’s performance could be affected adversely. It might have an impact on the productivity of your organization’s internal users and could affect your customers.

Staying current helps keep your organization’s systems responsive, and decreases or eliminates downtime. You'll maintain and improve your organization’s productivity. You’re also helping ensure that customers have more positive experiences with your organization’s products and services.

### Take advantage of the latest improvements and features

Windows gets better and smarter over time. Every feature update release comes with new enhancements and capabilities. A single update could offer a wide range of improvements and features.  For example, it might include:

- Increased performance and reliability of the operating system and its applications; for example, a recent feature update optimized how instructions are processed by the CPU 
- Improvements to assistive technologies in Windows, to help with accessibility
- Improvements to battery life and power efficiency for PCs with certain processors

Make sure you stay current, and don’t miss important features and improvements.

## How can your organization stay current?

You can help Woodgrove stay current by using the Windows Servicing process. The process consists of four phases that span four workstreams:

### Plan

During this phase, you'll define readiness criteria to pass through the prepare and deploy phases, and determine what needs to be updated by completing an assessment of your environment. You’ll prioritize applications, define go/no-go criteria, and make a list of infrastructure tools, agents, or configuration to be updated during the next phase. You can also use knowledge from previous Windows deployments to further reduce the effort, time, and cost for future Windows 10 feature updates.

### Prepare

In this phase, you’ll assign appropriate test approaches to your important and critical applications, testing the ones that must work during pilot deployment. You also update the infrastructure and configuration defined in the plan phase. Based on compatibility data and critical app testing, you make a list of devices that you’ll use for a pilot deployment.

### Pilot deployment

Your organization deploys the update on targeted devices to find any problems ahead of a wider implementation. At the end of this phase, you ensure that you’ve tested infrastructure, configuration, and applications as defined in the plan phase. You certify that the update can be pushed to broad deployment across the organization’s environment. If the update includes new capabilities, you ensure that they're all tested during this phase.

### Broad deployment

The update is pushed to the broader environment so that all devices are up to date. The knowledge and information you gain from this phase can be used in the plan phase for the next update cycle. 

### Workstreams

The phases in the process help you deal with the following workstreams for updates:

- **Compatibility**. In this workstream, Woodgrove assesses its devices and applications. The company determines how to prioritize application and device testing, based on a set of criteria. For example, Woodgrove would make sure to test applications classified as critical, either before or during the pilot deployment phase.

- **Deployment**. Here, Woodgrove sets out its readiness criteria, detailing the resources and tasks needed to update its infrastructure and configuration to support the Windows 10 feature update across its corporate environment.

- **Capability**. Woodgrove determines what capabilities and benefits it can gain from deploying an update, and notifying users about how to use them to improve productivity.

- **Modernization**. Woodgrove uses this workstream to understand how it can minimize the cost, time, and effort involved to improve the servicing process for future Windows 10 updates.

Compatibility and deployment are the core workstreams required for Woodgrove to successfully roll out the update. Capability and modernization are optional but they're recommended to improve the servicing process for updates.

Each workstream goes through the four phases, from the plan phase through to broad deployment. The table below shows how the phases are mapped to each workstream, along with the tasks that Woodgrove should carry out in each one:

## How to accelerate the stay current process

Different tools can help you accelerate the stay current process for Woodgrove.

### Windows Update for Business

You use the cloud-based Windows Update for Business service to reduce administrative and compatibility effort to deploy updates, and reduce bandwidth constraints for remote workers. Windows Update for Business helps simplify the process during the deploy phase, and eliminates much of the work that would otherwise need to be done to stay current.

By using Windows Update for Business, you'll always keep your Windows 10 devices up to date with the latest version of Windows. At the same time, you remain in control of when and how your devices are updated. For example, you can defer or pause device updates for a certain period of time. You can configure different policies for feature, quality, and driver updates, or updates for specific Microsoft products like Office. You use Windows Update for Business to test specific updates on a smaller segment of your environment, before pushing them out to the wider environment. You can integrate Windows Update for Business with Configuration Manager or Intune.

### Desktop Analytics

You use Desktop Analytics to accelerate the prepare and pilot deployment phases. Often, the biggest challenge for organizations wanting to stay current is testing. It can involve complex manual work. Testing might be time-consuming for the organization to continuously and thoroughly analyze application and device compatibility, and remediate issues across the whole environment.

Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service that integrates with Configuration Manager. The service gives a better insight into your organization’s update readiness. You can use it to:

- Create a record of apps running in the organization
- Assess how compatible your apps are with the latest Windows 10 feature updates
- Take advantage of mitigation suggestions for compatibility issues
- Create pilot groups to test across a certain set of devices
