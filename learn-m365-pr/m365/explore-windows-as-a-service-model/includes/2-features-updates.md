Feature Updates and quality updates work together to ensure you are up to date with the latest Windows enhancements and features.

In the past, Microsoft released new versions of the Windows operating system every few years, upgrades were infrequent and required a significant effort to deploy. 

In the Windows as a service (WaaS) model Microsoft no longer provides major operating system revisions every few years, with significant servicing updates (known as service packs) between these major revisions. Instead, consider Windows updates as an ongoing maintenance task rather than a periodic operating system upgrade project. The Windows operating system receives revisions and updates more frequently and they are applied with less disruption and effort. These updates fall into two categories: 

- **Feature updates**. These add new functionality and are released twice a year. These updates can be readily deployed using existing management tools. Because the updates are more frequent, they are smaller, so users take less time to adapt to changes. Consequently, the workload and cost impact on organizations is reduced. 
- **Quality updates**. These are security updates and fixes, usually issued once a month. On the second Tuesday of each month (“patch Tuesday”), a cumulative update is released that includes all previous updates. This helps to ensure that devices are fully up to date and more closely align to those used for testing in Microsoft. 

You can control how and when updates are applied with servicing channels and deployment rings:

**Servicing channels**: Windows as a service offers three servicing channels: Each of these channels receives new feature updates at a different frequency. 
**Deployment rings**: In Windows 10, deployment rings are similar to the groups your organization might have used to manage updates to earlier versions of Windows. These updates are within  tools such as Windows Server Update Services (WSUS). With deployment rings you can group devices together for the purposes of receiving updates via each of the servicing channels.
