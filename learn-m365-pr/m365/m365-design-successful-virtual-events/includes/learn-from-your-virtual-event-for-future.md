Your virtual summit was a rousing success. You're happy with how it went, and people have already commented how they've enjoyed it. But your work isn't done. A large part of running a successful event is capturing feedback from everyone and being open to suggestions and insights for what can be improved. There are also a few other actions you can do to set yourself up for future event success.

Here you'll learn about common post event actions. These are applicable to any kind of event.

## Processing feedback

Provide attendees with clear instructions on how to complete your post event survey. Use your attendee list to send reminders if they've not been completed. It's also a good idea to ask your event team, presenters, organizers, and moderators to also complete the survey.

Your presenters will be eager to understand how satisfied attendees are. Try to collate your survey results and provide feedback to the presenters as quickly as possible. The industry norm is within 72 hours of the end of the event.

If your virtual event was run using Teams Live Events, a producer or presenter can download the Q&A report and an attendee engagement report to explore more data.

## Content lifecycle

Attendees will want to review the content after your scheduled live event. Although slides and pre-recorded videos can be shared right away in a location you manage, you may want to process live recordings before making them generally available. For example, you may want to include closed captioning in different languages. Consider publishing presentations or other content in Sway and PDF format for maximum consistency and availability.

## Communications

Send a "Thank you for attending" communication to attendees. You can include a reminder to complete the post event survey and links to access the on-demand content. You should also update any event webpage with a thank you message, a survey reminder, and instructions on how to access the on-demand content.
You should also send a "Thanks for making it great" communication to your events team and presenters. Without them the event couldn't have happened.

> [!TIP]
> **Thank your team**: Your event team has successfully produced your virtual summit, moving it from in-person to an all-digital format, so use all of your newly gained organization skills to host a wrap party, either in-person or virtually to celebrate. This is a great way to thank your team for all their hard work. Invest in their health and wellbeing by encouraging everyone to rest. Another idea, especially for large scale or high-profile events, is to arrange time off for everyone involved for recuperation. Do this BEFORE you conduct any event reviews.

## Future strategy

As you're processing feedback and publishing the on-demand content, think about how you can improve your next event. Does it make sense to continue to engage this audience? How could you run follow-up engagements?

Can you build a community around the event? Is it appropriate to have a forum where attendees and presenters can continue conversations?

A best practice for most events is to run a retrospective, or "a postmortem." It lets you review what went well and what could be improved on in the future. Schedule some time to complete a full event review to capture operational improvements you and your team can apply to your next event.
