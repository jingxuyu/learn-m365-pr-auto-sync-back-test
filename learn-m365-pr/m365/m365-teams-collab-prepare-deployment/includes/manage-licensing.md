Microsoft 365 subscriptions, including Microsoft Teams, are available in the following types of plans:

- Small business
- Enterprise
- Education
- Developer

In terms of Teams core functionalities, there are no differences between the subscriptions. The availability of the compliance capabilities does rely on the correct subscription level.

Microsoft Teams licensing is designed to give you maximum flexibility. After using basic Teams features, you can buy add-on licenses for more features such as audio conferencing, phone system, calling plans, and Microsoft Teams rooms.

For audio conferencing, your organization will need to buy and assign an audio-conferencing license to each user who will set up dial-in meetings. For calling plans, each user will need a phone system plus a domestic or domestic and international calling plan.

Use messaging policies, managed from the Teams admin center, to control what chat and channel messaging features are available to users in Teams. You can use the default policy or create one or more custom messaging policies for people in your organization.

All supported subscription plans are eligible for access to the Teams web client, desktop clients, and mobile apps.

## Manage Teams user licenses through the Microsoft 365 admin center

Teams user-level licenses are managed directly through the Microsoft 365 admin center user-management interface. An administrator can assign licenses to new users when new user accounts are created, or to existing users. The administrator must have Global Administrator or User Management Administrator privileges to manage Microsoft Teams licenses.

When a license SKU is assigned to a user, a Microsoft Teams license is automatically assigned, and the user is enabled for Microsoft Teams. Administrators can have granular control over all the services and licenses, and the Microsoft Teams license for a specific user or a group of users can be enabled or disabled.
