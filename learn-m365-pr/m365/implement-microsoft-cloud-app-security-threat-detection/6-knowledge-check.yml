  - content: "An administrator wants to start detecting malware using Cloud App Security. Which of the following represents their best approach to achieving this?"
    choices:
    - content: "The administrator doesn’t need to do anything. Malware detection is enabled out of the box in Cloud App Security"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Malware detection is not enabled by default."
    - content: "The administrator must create a malware detection policy from an activity log search."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: " That's incorrect. The administrator doesn’t need to create a malware detection policy as one already exists."
    - content: "The administrator must enable the Malware detection policy in the list of policies in the Cloud App Security portal."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Cloud App Security provides a default malware detection policy, but it must be enabled."
