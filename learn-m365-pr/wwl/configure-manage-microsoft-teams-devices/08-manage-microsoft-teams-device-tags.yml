  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Fabrikam has employed a large assortment of devices across its Microsoft 365 deployment. The Teams admin earlier implemented device tags as a means of filtering all the devices of a certain type. Fabrikam has since narrowed down the types of devices they use. As such, the admin wants to remove a tag that was associated with multiple devices of a certain type that Fabrikam no longer uses. What's the first thing the admin should do to remove the tag?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete the tag in the Microsoft Teams admin center"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This step isn't the first thing you should do to remove the tag. Try again."
    - content: "Select the Teams user that's associated with each device and remove the tag from the user"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If you want to remove a tag from multiple devices, you must select the Teams user that's associated with the device and remove the tag from the user."
