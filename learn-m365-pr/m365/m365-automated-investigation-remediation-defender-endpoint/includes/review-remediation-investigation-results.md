You've learned about automated investigation and remediation (AIR). But you also need to know about the tasks you'd carry out to use it properly. For example, how do you keep track and manage automated actions? And how can you find investigation results?

Here, you'll learn how to review investigation results and remediation actions in AIR.

## Review remediation actions

You use the information in the Action center in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to review your remediation actions for your automated investigations and see completed actions. You access the Action center by selecting **Action center** in the navigation pane.

To review pending actions, you select an action from the **Pending** tab. You can then review key information for the selected action. When you're done, you select **Approve** to initiate the pending action, or select **Reject** to prevent it from running.

To review a completed action, select it from the *History* tab. You can then review detailed information about your chosen action.

## Review investigation results

When you select **Open investigation page** in the action details pane, you'll be taken to an investigation page for the incident, where you can view detailed information about the results of the automated investigation that relates to the action:

You use the investigation page to see:

- An investigation graph that maps the relationship between affected entities and how a threat has been remediated across entities.
- Investigation details such as its status, the severity of the threat, and more.
- A timeline to help you understand when a threat was identified and how long it has taken to remediate the threat.
