This module focused on using insights from the needs assessment to build and customize the Viva Connections experience. First, we reviewed technical requirements that will need to be complete before the Viva Connections Dashboard can be set up. We also reviewed the diverse types of cards that can be used on the Dashboard and some popular scenarios for those cards. Lastly, we covered considerations for preparing content for the Feed and step-by-step guidance on how to set up Resources.

Key takeaways:

- **Your organization must have a home site and customized global navigation:** For the Viva Connections to become possible, your organization must meet these two requirements at a minimum.
- **Optionally, consider modernizing classic sites and pages:** If your organization still uses classic sites and pages, consider strategically modernizing sites and pages that should display in the Teams app instead of a separate browser window.
- **There are several types of Dashboard cards that can be used:** Build your Dashboard with a variety of cards to meet high-impact needs. Use third-party cards to connect to other services your organization subscribes to. Develop custom cards with quick views for unique and interactive experiences.
- **Get content prepared for the Feed:** Establish news content sources if needed and decide which content should be prioritized over others.
- **Set up and Resources:** Customize links in SharePoint global navigation to build a library of resources that connect to popular content and intranet portals.
- **Personalize the experience using audience targeting:** Filter content to people in different roles and regions to make it easy to view the most important information throughout the Viva Connections experience.
- **Use the Dashboard and Feed web parts for the desktop experience:** Complete the Viva Connections desktop experience by using these web parts on your organizationâ€™s home site.
