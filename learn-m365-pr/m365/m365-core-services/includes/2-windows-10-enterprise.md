Windows 10 investigates threats as they evolve and automates remediation to make response times faster, thanks to the Intelligent Security Graph (which uses security intelligence, machine learning, and behavioral analytics). These security solutions are built-in and provide you with full security lifecycle management for endpoint protection (EPP) and detection and response (EDR). It also integrates with Microsoft 365 systems, which covers even the most complex multi-platform environments.
