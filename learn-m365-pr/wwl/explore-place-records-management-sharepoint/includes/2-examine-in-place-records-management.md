Records management is the process by which an organization:

 -  Determines what kinds of information should be considered records.
 -  Determines how active documents that will become records should be handled while they're being used.
 -  Determines how active documents should be collected after they're declared to be records.
 -  Determines in what manner and for how long each record type should be retained to meet legal, business, or regulatory requirements.
 -  Researches and implements technological solutions and business processes to help ensure that the organization follows its records management obligations in a cost-effective and non-intrusive way.
 -  Completes records-related tasks such as disposing of expired records and locating and protecting records that are related to external events such as lawsuits.

Careful planning is essential to ensure that an organization's records management implementation in SharePoint achieves its records management goals. A successful records management planning process should include the following steps:

1.  **Identify records management roles.** Records management requires specialized corporate roles that encompass different responsibilities within an organization, such as:
    
     -  Records managers or compliance officers to categorize the records in the organization and manage the records management process.
     -  IT personnel to implement the systems that efficiently support records management.
     -  Content managers to find where information is kept and ensure that their teams follow records management practices.
2.  **Analyze organizational content.** Records managers and content managers should survey document usage in the organization to determine which documents and other items can, or should, become records.
3.  **Develop a file plan.** File plans differ from organization to organization. However, they typically:
    
     -  describe the types of items the organization decides are records.
     -  indicate where these items/records are stored.
     -  describe their retention periods.
     -  provide other information, such as who's responsible for managing them and which broader category of records they belong to.
4.  **Develop retention schedules.** For each record type, determine when it's no longer active (being used), how long it should be kept after that, and how it should ultimately be disposed of.
5.  **Evaluate and improve document management practices.** Make sure that required policies are being applied in document libraries. For example, verify that content is being appropriately audited so that suitable audits are kept together with records.
6.  **Design the records management solution.** Determine whether to create a Records Center, manage records in-place, or use a combination of the two approaches. Based on your file plan, design the Record Center site, or determine how to use existing sites to contain active documents and records.
7.  **Plan how content becomes records.** When using SharePoint for both active document management and records management, you can create custom workflows to move documents to a Records Center site. Organizations should plan and develop interfaces that move content from systems to a Records Center site, or that declare a document to be a record but don't move the document (In-Place Records Management). A training plan should be created to teach users how to create and work with records.
8.  **Plan email integration.** Organizations should decide whether to manage email records within SharePoint, or manage email records within the email application itself.
9.  **Plan compliance for social content.** If your organization uses social media such as blogs, wikis, or My Sites, determine how this content will become records.
10. **Plan compliance reporting and documentation.** Organizations should document their records management plans and processes to verify they're completing their required records management practices. If an organization becomes engaged in records-related litigation, it may have to produce these records management guidelines, implementation plans, and effectiveness metrics.

### Benefits of in-place records management in SharePoint

In-place records management enables organizations to control content in collaborative spaces. In doing so, certain SharePoint documents (or blogs, wikis, web pages, and list items) can be declared as records. An in-place records management system can also prevent such records from being deleted or edited based upon your organization's definition of what a record is.

Implementing an in-place records management system provides many benefits to an organization, including:

 -  Records can exist and be managed across multiple sites.
 -  With versioning enabled, maintaining versions of records is automatic.
 -  eDiscovery search can be executed against both records and active documents at the same time.
 -  Broader control over what a record is in your organization and who can create a record.

### Final considerations

However, before taking the step of implementing in-place records management as opposed to managing records in a separate Records Center, you should consider the following questions:

 -  **Is the governance of the collaboration site appropriate for managing records?**
 -  **Is your industry subject to regulatory requirements that mandate records be separated from active documents?**
 -  **Should the administrator of a collaboration site be trusted to manage a site that contains records?** You might want to store records in a site that uses more restricted access than the collaboration site, or in a site that is backed up on a different schedule.
 -  **How long will the collaboration site be in use?** If records must be kept for longer than the project is ongoing, choosing an in-place records management strategy means that you'll have to maintain the collaboration site even after it's no longer used.
 -  **Will the project members need frequent access to the documents after the documents have become records?** If you use an in-place approach, project members can access documents in the same manner, even when documents are active or they're records.
 -  **Are records managers in your organization responsible only for records, or are they responsible for all information, including both active documents and records?** If records managers are responsible only for official records, having a separate records center may be easier for them.
