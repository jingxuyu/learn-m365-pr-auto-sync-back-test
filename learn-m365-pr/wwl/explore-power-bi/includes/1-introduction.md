Power Business Intelligence, otherwise known as Power BI, is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data can range from a simple Microsoft Excel workbook to a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. With your data in hand, Power BI lets you easily:

 -  Connect to your data sources.
 -  Visualize (or discover) what's important.
 -  Share that with anyone or everyone you want.

In this module, you'll examine how to build a Power BI report and dashboard that meets your exact business needs and integrates and interacts with your business data.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe what Power BI is and how it's used by organizations.
 -  Describe how Power BI connects to data sources.
 -  Build and share a basic Power BI report and dashboard.
 -  Administer Power BI permissions, licensing, and row level security.
