During the course of this module, you will learn about **Windows Autopilot** and the benefits it can provide to modern IT organizations.  From the very beginning, to the very end of a device's lifecycle Windows Autopilot is an essential tool to reduce the burden on IT teams when registering, resetting, and recovering devices.

In this module, you will learn to:

- Describe the benefits of Windows Autopilot to IT organizations.
- Define the different methods of deploying Windows clients via Autopilot.
- Explain the different administration options for device configuration.

**Windows Autopilot** offers a zero-touch, self-service Windows deployment platform. The Windows Autopilot process runs immediately after powering on a new computer for the first time, enabling employees to configure new devices to be business-ready with just a few clicks.

You can also use Windows Autopilot to reset, repurpose and recover devices. This solution enables an IT department to achieve the above with little to no infrastructure to manage, with a process that's easy and simple.

Windows Autopilot is designed to simplify all parts of the lifecycle of Windows devices, for both IT and end users, from initial deployment through the eventual end of life. Leveraging cloud-based services, it can reduce the overall costs for deploying, managing, and retiring devices by reducing the amount of time that IT needs to spend on these processes and the amount of infrastructure that they need to maintain, while ensuring ease of use for all types of end users.

- Auto-enroll devices into MDM services, such as **Microsoft Intune**.
- Restrict the Administrator account creation.
- Create and auto-assign devices to configuration groups based on a device's profile.
- Customize Out-of-box-experience (OOBE) content specific to the organization.

## Benefits of Windows Autopilot

Traditionally, IT pros spend a lot of time building and customizing images that will later be deployed to devices. Windows Autopilot introduces a new approach.

From the user's perspective, it only takes a few simple operations to make their device ready to use. The only interaction required from the end user is to set their language and regional settings, connect to a network, and verify their credentials. Everything beyond that is automated.
