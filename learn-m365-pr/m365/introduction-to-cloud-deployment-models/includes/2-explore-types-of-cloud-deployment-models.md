## Public cloud:
Public cloud is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local infrastructure hardware to manage or keep up to date – everything runs on your cloud provider’s hardware.  

Organizations can use multiple public cloud providers of varying scale. Microsoft Office 365 and Azure are examples of public clouds.  
 
Some advantages of the public cloud are: 
- High scalability and agility – You don’t have to buy new server hardware to increase your scale. 
- Pay-as-you-go pricing – You pay only for what you use. 
- No hardware maintenance – You’re not responsible for maintenance or updates of the hardware. 
- Minimal technical knowledge needed to set up and use - You don't need to know how to set up servers, storage, and software services and keep them up to date. 

A common public cloud use case is the deploying a web application or a blog site on a cloud provider’s hardware and resources. In this case, using a public cloud allows a cloud user to get a website or blog up quickly.  
 
## Private cloud 

In a private cloud, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to users in your organization. This offers a simulation of a public cloud to your users, but you remain in control and responsible for the purchase and maintenance of the hardware and software services you provide. For example, a private cloud can provide cloud functionality to external customers as well, or to specific internal departments such as Accounting or Human Resources. 

This approach has several advantages: 
- You have complete control over the resources and can ensure the configuration can support your scenarios or legacy applications 
- You have complete control (and responsibility) over security 
- Depending on how they are configured and maintained, private clouds can meet strict security, compliance, or legal requirements of a particular industry 

There are a few things to keep in mind when considering a private cloud, including that it requires IT skills and expertise. There are also upfront costs, and it’s not as agile as a cloud service provider. To scale, you must buy, install, and set up new hardware to meet increased demand.  
 
## Hybrid cloud 

A hybrid cloud combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the location that’s most appropriate for each one. For example, you could host a website in the public cloud and link it to a highly secure database hosted in your private cloud or your on-premises datacenter. 

This is helpful when you have data that you can’t put in the cloud. You might have data that can’t be exposed publicly (like medical data) that needs to be held in your private datacenter. Or you might have line of business apps that run on old hardware that can’t be updated. With a hybrid cloud you can keep the old system running locally, and connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage. 

Some advantages of a hybrid cloud versus a private cloud are: 
- You can keep highly regulated or highly valuable data stored locally. 
- You have flexibility with what you run locally versus in the cloud. You can keep systems that use out-of-date hardware or operating systems running and accessible. 
- You can take advantage of public cloud providers for services and resources.  

When considering a hybrid cloud approach, consider that you incur both on-premises and cloud service costs. It can also be more complicated to set up and manage hybrid connections between on-premises and cloud-based services.
