With any business process, it is important to define key tasks and who will be responsible for them.

At Contoso Electronics, you decide to build a proposal for deploying SharePoint Syntex to the company's SharePoint libraries. After gaining a basic sense of what SharePoint Syntex is and does, you need to understand the roles needed to administer SharePoint Syntex.

SharePoint Syntex has four main roles you will need to designate and assign:

- **SharePoint/Knowledge admin**: Enables AI Builder, creates content centers, and maintains SharePoint Syntex going forward, including user permissions and access.
- **Power Platform admin**: Configures the data service environment for form processing and purchases and allocates AI Builder (AIB) credits.
- **Knowledge manager**: Establishes best practices and use cases for using SharePoint Syntex.
- **Model owner**: Owns, creates, and oversees document understanding and/or form processing models.

You will see how existing roles within your organization might already align with the responsibilities necessary to set up and administer SharePoint Syntex.

## SharePoint/Knowledge admin role and responsibilities

The SharePoint/Knowledge admin will need to not only establish your organization's SharePoint Syntex instance but also maintain it. The SharePoint admin will configure form processing in individual SharePoint document libraries and set up the default content center and additional content centers for document understanding models, as needed. The SharePoint admin is also responsible for assigning and controlling permissions for who can access each content center.  

As you build your case for using SharePoint Syntex at Contoso Electronics, you might make suggestions about which people in which departments could serve the SharePoint/Knowledge admin role. One argument could be made for naming an IT specialist to this role, since it is a little technical. On the other hand, an argument can be made for naming a person with a high-level view of the company'as overall content. Maybe someone whose role already deals with administrative or organizational tasks and who has a strong understanding of what different roles within the organization need from their document libraries. For instance, a technical writer might be ideal for this role since they understand documentation. An administrative assistant may also be a good option, considering their understanding of the organization's structure.

No matter who is named the SharePoint/Knowledge admin, you need buy-in from that person and from the teams they'll serve.  

## Power Platform admin role and responsibilities

An administrator with this role manages the Power Apps AI Builder capabilities within each SharePoint document library, enabling form processing. They will be responsible for configuring the data service environment for form processing, as well as purchasing and allocating AI Builder (AIB) credits.  

Based on the requirements for this role, you want someone on your team who has a similar skillset to your SharePoint/Knowledge admin. They need to be someone who has organizational knowledge to provide the necessary access to AI Builder, as well as technical understanding of the Power Platform environment and AIB credits.

Considering this, within Contoso Electronics, a technical writer may be ideal as your Power Platform admin since they know the documentation process. You could also consider the IT admin, who already handles the IT operations of your organization.

## Knowledge manager role and responsibilities

The knowledge manager role oversees the models. They pinpoint and aggregate specific use cases for content understanding that apply to your organization's needs and pain points. They establish the best practices and guidelines for using SharePoint Syntex. The knowledge manager also reviews the models on a regular basis, checking the model analytics to ensure that models are working properly and evaluating the information they are returning.

You want to appoint someone who works closely with the model owners and with your document libraries on a day-to-day basis. You could consider a Customer Service or Sales representative. Both roles manage contracts and other important customer information. They'd have a good sense of the current state of Contoso Electronics' information. Since they deal with the content libraries daily, they likely have insight into how to improve organization and compliance.

## Model owner role and responsibilities

The model owner owns the use of the models. They create and oversee the document understanding and/or form processing models. They are the champions or advocates for the models and their use, so they should be closely tied to the input and output of the models. To build meaningful, useful models, they will need to gather real business use cases within your organization. They will need to transform use cases into document understanding models and form processing models. The model owner can then apply models to existing libraries.

For your proposal to adopt SharePoint Syntex at Contoso, you have to decide whether a single person in the company should act as model owner, or whether each department should name a model owner.

A single model owner offers centralized control over how documents are processed. Company information policies are easier to enforce. You might consider a content specialist who is comfortable creating models. This may be a technical writer or an administrative person with company-wide content knowledge.  

Alternatively, you could recommend that each department identify a model owner. Opting for different model owners for different sectors of the business allows for targeted models that capitalizes on each department's understanding of what they need from their content libraries.

In addition to these roles and responsibilities, you will want to think about who will manage security and permissions for SharePoint Syntex Consider another role:

### Global admin

This person will manage access for SharePoint Syntex users. This role controls levels of access and what users have access to. The global admin is likely a security specialist with IT understanding since tenant-level settings require more backend work and an understanding of how to administer IT settings. The global administrator will need to be comfortable with not only establishing tenant-level settings but also updating them on a regular basis, as needed, including when new model owners and other admins are onboarded to your organization.
