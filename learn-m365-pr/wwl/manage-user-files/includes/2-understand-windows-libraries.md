The libraries feature in Windows provides a central place to manage files that are located in multiple locations throughout your computer. Instead of selecting through many directories to find your files, including them in a library provides faster access.

To view libraries in File Explorer, select **View** then select **Navigation pane** and select **Show libraries**.

### Using libraries

By default, certain libraries will already exist depending on which version of Windows you're using and which version you may have migrated from. These libraries may include:

 -  Documents
 -  Saved Pictures
 -  Videos
 -  Music
 -  Camera Roll
 -  Pictures

You can create or delete libraries by right-clicking on one. Adding a folder to a library doesn't physically move the folder on the computer; it simply associates the folder with a certain library. To add a folder to a library, right-click the folder and select **Include in library** and select a library.

Users may add network folder locations to libraries. However, users will only be accessible when the computer can connect to that networked location. They canâ€™t be accessed in offline scenarios.

> Homegroups, first introduced in Windows 7, are retired, and no longer available as of v1803.
