Data governance in Microsoft 365 enables you to archive content as appropriate in Exchange mailboxes, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive for Business locations in your Microsoft 365 organization.

### In-Place Archiving in Exchange

Archiving in Exchange is performed by a feature called In-Place Archiving. With In-Place Archiving, users can view an archive mailbox and move or copy messages between their primary mailbox and their archive mailbox. Archive mailboxes allow you to offload the data footprint on the Exchange servers while controlling the lifecycle of mailbox items.

Unlike offline store (xxx.ost) files (which are used by Outlook in Cached Exchange Mode to store a copy of the online mailbox for offline access), personal store (xxx.pst) files aren't synchronized with the user's Exchange mailbox. If a user moves messages to a .pst file, those messages are removed from the mailbox. This process can result in compliance issues that include unmanaged files, increased discovery costs, inability to apply retention policies, and risk of data theft. With archive mailboxes, your organization can control messaging data by eliminating the need for personal store files and allowing users to store messages in an archive mailbox.

### In-Place Records Management in SharePoint

SharePoint's answer to document storage is a feature called In-Place Records Management. In-Place Records Management enables you to effectively manage records in collaborative spaces including auditing, retention, reporting, discovery, legal hold, and more. However, records management doesn't start, or stop, in the archive.

In-Place Records Management allows SharePoint documents (or blogs, wikis, web pages, and list items) to be declared as records. Depending on your organizationâ€™s definition of what a record is, the system can prevent such records from being deleted or edited. The result is an effective records management system that strikes a balance between SharePoint's value to end users and the need for information governance.
