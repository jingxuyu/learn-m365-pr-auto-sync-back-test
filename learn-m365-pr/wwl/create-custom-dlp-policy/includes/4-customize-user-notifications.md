The previous unit examined the steps that must be completed to update the conditions and actions for an existing policy. This unit continues the update process, this time focusing on user notifications when the policy goes into effect.

The **User notifications** section of the Security and Compliance Center lets organizations configure and customize the notifications that people receive when a user attempts to share content that's protected. Users can be notified by email and by policy tips.

In our continuing example, letâ€™s customize the policy tip to explain to users why access is being blocked when they attempt to share content that's protected.

18. In the list of tabs across the top of the **Low volume of content detected** window, select **User notifications**.
19. In the **User notifications** section, verify the toggle switch is set to **On** (if not, set it to **On**).
20. Under **Email notifications**, the **Notify these people** option is selected by default. The three default options are all selected. You also want to notify your default Global administrator, so select **Add or remove people**.
21. In the **Add or remove people** window, select **+Add**.
22. In the list of users that's displayed, select the organization's **Global administrators** and then select **Add**.
23. Once the users are added, select **Done**.
24. At the bottom of the **User notifications** section, under **Policy tips**, select the **Customize the policy tip text** checkbox.
25. In the **policy tip** text field that appears, enter a message such as: **Sharing personal information with any recipient is a violation of corporate policy. Contact your manager if you have any questions**.<br>:::image type="content" source="../media/customize-policy-tip-field-1897e09d.png" alt-text="screenshot of the customize policy tip field":::
    

You'll continue updating the policy in the next unit, which covers user overrides.
