  - content: "How can an add-in detect the version of the Word JavaScript API supported in the current component?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Word is always using the latest Word JavaScript API version available, so there's no need to check."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Desktop installable versions of Word don't automatically use the latest version of the Word JavaScript API."
    - content: "Use the `Office.context.requirements.isSetSupported('WordApi','#.#')` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the `Office.context.getCurrentVersion('WordApi')` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `getCurrentVersion()` method doesn't exist. Use the `Office.context.requirements.isSetSupported('WordApi','#.#')` method to determine the current version."
