Windows 10 is the most secure operating system built by Microsoft and includes the latest security technology available today.

With tools and features built into Windows 10, you can holistically defend your end users from attacks. 

- **Windows Hello** is a more personal, more secure way to get instant access to your Windows 10 devices using fingerprint or facial recognition.
- **Credential Guard** uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets so that only privileged system software can access them. Unauthorized access to these secrets can lead to credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash or Pass-The-Ticket. Windows Defender Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NTLM password hashes, Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets, and credentials stored by applications as domain credentials.
- **Device Guard** is a group of key features designed to harden a computer system against malware. Its focus is **preventing malicious code from running** by ensuring only known good code can run.
