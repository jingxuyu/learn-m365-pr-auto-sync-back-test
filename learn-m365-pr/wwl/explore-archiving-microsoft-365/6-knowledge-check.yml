  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Through which of the following record management methods do users get a consistent view of their messaging data without needing to use .pst files?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-place archiving"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. With an In-Place Archive, the user gets a consistent view of their messaging data without needing to use .pst files. Because the content is stored in the userâ€™s archive mailbox instead of a .pst file, the user doesn't need to worry about creating personal backups of their messaging data. Instead, the content is automatically saved in Exchange."
    - content: "Information Rights Management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Information Rights Management provides persistent online and offline protection for email messages and attachments. It isn't a record management method. Try again."
    - content: "In-place records management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In-place records management is SharePoint's answer to document storage. Try again."
  - content: "Northwind Traders' management wants to take a hybrid approach to implementing records management. They want to keep records in their current locations with active documents for two years, and then move records to a records archive when a project is complete. Given this requirement, which records management method should Northwind Traders implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "In-place archiving"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. With In-Place Archiving, users can view an archive mailbox and move or copy messages between their primary mailbox and their archive mailbox.  Try again."
    - content: "Messaging record management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Messaging records management is the records management technology in Exchange Server and Exchange Online that helps organizations manage their email lifecycle and reduce the legal risks associated with email. Try again."
    - content: "In-place records management"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In Place Records Management is an alternative to the traditional process of copying or moving records to another location. You can manage records in place, declare it as a record, and apply the appropriate security, retention, and disposition properties to the record. You can also take a hybrid approach to record management. For example, you could keep records in place with active documents for two years, and then move records to a records archive when a project is complete."
  - content: "Tailspin Toys' management has decided that its records managers won't be responsible for active documents and records. They'll only be responsible for records. Given this requirement, which records management method would be easiest for Tailspin Toys to implement?"
    choices:
    - content: "A Records Center site"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Since Tailspin's record managers are responsible only for official records and not active documents, having a separate Records Center site would be easiest for them to implement."
    - content: "In-place archiving"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In-place archiving isn't a record management method. Try again."
    - content: "In-place records management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. With In-place records management, you can either manage records in place, which means that you can leave a document in its current location on a site, or you can classify documents as records and store them in a specific archive. Since Tailspin Toys doesn't want its record managers responsible for active documents, this would not be the easiest solution to implement. Try again."
