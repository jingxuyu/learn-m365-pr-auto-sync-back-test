    choices:
    - content: "Accounts in any organizational directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An organization will select this option if it wants users in any Azure AD tenant to be able to use the application. This option is appropriate if, for example, you're building a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that you intend to provide to multiple organizations. This type of app is known as a multitenant application in the Microsoft identity platform."
    - content: "Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft account"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This option targets the widest set of customers. By selecting this option, you're registering a multitenant application that can also support users who have personal Microsoft accounts."
    - content: "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. An organization will select this option if it's building an application for use only by users (or guests) in its tenant. Often called a line-of-business (LOB) application, this app is a single-tenant application in the Microsoft identity platform."
