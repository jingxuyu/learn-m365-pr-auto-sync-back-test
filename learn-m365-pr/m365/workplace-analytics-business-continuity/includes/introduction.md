The Workplace Analytics Business continuity dashboard uses a Power Business Intelligence (BI) template that's populated with Workplace Analytics data. You use this behavioral data to get insights into how your organization and employees are being impacted by the shift to remote work. This dashboard directionally highlights where the shift to remote work might have the biggest impacts, and offers a measurable starting point for helping you understand where you might use tools and processes to support and sustain new ways of working.

The dashboard lets you visualize and explore these top-level business questions:

- How are collaboration activities changing?
- What are the impacts of work-life integration?
- Are external relationships being maintained?
- Are employees engaged and connected?
- How are work patterns evolving?
- How can remote work effectiveness be improved?

These insights can help to protect the wellbeing of employees by empowering leaders to make remote work more effective so employees can do their best work.

Suppose you work as the chief of staff for a major business unit at a technology company and your organization shifts to 100% remote work. After three months, your leadership team asks you to measure the effect of the shift to remote work on employee collaboration and wellbeing. You suspect that for many employees, work is bleeding over into personal time.  As a result, there's a drop in employees' ability to effectively collaborate while maintaining a sense of balance. You use Workplace Analytics with the assigned role of Workplace Analytics Analyst and the Business continuity Power BI dashboard to get a look at how your organization has adapted to working remotely.
