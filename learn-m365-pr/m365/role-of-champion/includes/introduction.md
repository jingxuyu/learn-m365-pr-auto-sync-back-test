Rolling out a new OKR program requires a lot of planning, support, and knowledge about the OKR framework. OKR Champions lead the way and streamline this process, ensuring a successful OKR rollout.

Imagine you work for a company that has decided to start using OKRs with Viva Goals. Everyone needs to learn how to use and write OKRs, how to use the software, and how to incorporate these new practices into their daily work rhythms. Essentially, it's a lot of new information! OKR Champions take the lead in helping their teams navigate through this process successfully.

By the end of this module, you will be able to define OKR Champion, name and describe the four key responsibilities of an OKR Champion, identify three strategies for effective communication, and identify the three timeframes for sending out resources and where to find them.
