When a hardware device fails, you usually have to replace it. To minimize the risk of a replacement device failing, adhere to the following guidelines:

 -  When you install a device, take care to minimize the risk of damage during the installation process.
 -  Eliminate support issues by choosing replacement devices that are compatible with Windows 10.
 -  Follow your organizationâ€™s process for replacing hardware devices, including how to discard storage devices.
 -  Update the incident report after you replace the device and resolve the issue.

#### Root-cause analysis

Before you replace failed hardware devices, you should try to determine the cause of the root failure so that you can prevent this issue from damaging replacement device. The root cause could be environmental, such as heat or moisture-related failures. For example, devices placed in direct sunlight, with poor ventilation, or in a damp location where there might be condensation, could fail after a short time. Alternatively, the root cause could be behavioral, such as users knocking or kicking the computer.

#### Verify if you can replace individual components

Check for warranties for failed hardware. Computer warranties often prohibit you from replacing hardware components. Some devices, especially tablets, do not support user replacement of failed parts. Typically, you will need to return the device to the manufacturer or their service agent to have parts replaced.

#### Static-electricity issues

Because of the risks that static electricity poses to devices, such as degradation of system memory, it is important that you observe static-electricity guidelines, and that you train your IT staff accordingly. Initiate compulsory maintenance procedures, and ensure that you use antistatic kits, which are inexpensive and available from numerous hardware manufacturers. Hardware vendors operate professional hardware-qualification programs that include detailed information about antistatic maintenance precautions.

As a best practice, you should ensure that IT staff wears grounding straps when working with sensitive components. Grounding straps play a critical role in not only the well being of electrical devices, but also in the safety of the people operating those devices. Ground straps protect you from getting shocked by electrostatic discharge, like that of lightning and static electricity, that's emitted from electrical devices that don't have proper grounding. Grounding straps also protect the equipment itself from damage, especially with components like circuits. Ground straps prevent things such as short circuiting, overheated wires, system memory damage, and more.

#### Windows version compatibility

When you purchase a new computer, verify that it is Windows 10 or Windows 11 compatible. All hardware components in a Windows 10 or 11 compatible computer have been tested and verified that they are optimized to run it's respective Windows operating system.

#### Minimize interruption to users

Try to be as effective as possible when replacing hardware components. Replacement of one component should not cause problems with other components. If you need to replace a failed hard disk drive, and the old drive contained user data, try to restore the data from last computer backup.
