Microsoft Teams is available in different license models, from a Teams (free) license to subscriptions that include Teams and other voice add-on licenses. Teams administrators should recognize appropriate licensing to get a complete set of Teams features. For example, if users aren't assigned SharePoint and Exchange Online licenses correctly, some Teams features will not work, that utilize these services.

## Microsoft Teams licenses

You manage access to Teams at the user level by assigning or removing a Microsoft Teams product license. Except for joining Teams meetings anonymously, each user in your organization must have a Teams license before they can use Teams. You can assign a Teams license for new users when new user accounts are created or to users with existing accounts.

### Teams license

By default, when a licensing plan (for example, Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 or Microsoft 365 Business Premium) is assigned to a user, a Teams license is automatically assigned, and the user is enabled for Teams. You can disable or enable Teams for a user by removing or assigning a license at any time.

### Teams (free) license

Free version of Microsoft Teams is best for businesses that need to get started quickly with secure online meetings, chat, and cloud storageâ€”all in one app, for free.

In the free version of Microsoft Teams, the first person who signs up in your organization has a limited admin role. The person who has this limited role can add and remove team members and specify whether anyone can invite other members, but this user has no advanced administrative capabilities and no access to the Microsoft Teams admin center. 

To get the full set of Teams features, including enhanced administration, you'll need to upgrade to the full version of Teams by purchasing an appropriate Microsoft 365 or Office 365 subscription plan for your users.

## Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

Besides basic Teams features, there are add-on licenses for more features such as audio conferencing,  Teams Phone, calling plans, and Microsoft Teams rooms.

* For audio conferencing, organizations will need to buy and assign an audio-conferencing license to each user who will set up dial-in meetings.

* For calling plans, each user will need a Teams Phone, plus a domestic or domestic and international calling plan. The add-on licensing options available to you depend on the Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan you have.

Here's a list of features that you can add with Teams add-on licenses.

## Licensing for governance, security, and compliance features

Microsoft Teams is built on the Microsoft 365 and Office 365 hyper-scale, enterprise-grade cloud, delivering the advanced security and compliance capabilities. When it comes to information protection capabilities, Microsoft 365 subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, and the associated standalone licenses will determine the available feature set.

## Licensing for guest access

Guest access is included with all Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Enterprise, and Microsoft 365 Education subscriptions. No extra Microsoft 365 license is necessary. Teams doesn't restrict the number of guests you can add. However, the total number of guests that can be added to your tenant may be restricted by the paid features of Azure AD. For more information, see [Billing model for Azure AD External Identities](/azure/active-directory/b2b/licensing-guidance?azure-portal=true).


Due to the consequent development of Microsoft 365, available services and licenses change continuously. Teams administrators should always be ready to adopt to changes of the license requirements. For the latest update on licensing, see [Microsoft Teams service description](/microsoftteams/office-365-licensing?#key-collaboration-governance-capabilities-and-licensing-requirements?azure-portal=true).
