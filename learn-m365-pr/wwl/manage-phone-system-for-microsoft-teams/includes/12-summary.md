This module examined the Microsoft Teams features that enhance the user experience and create auto attendants to manage calls. Some of these features have been used in telephony solutions for decades. They provide a way for organizations to configure their Teams environments to keep providing these capabilities.

This module focused on the Temas Phone feature in Microsoft Teams. Temas Phone enables users to place and receive calls, transfer calls, and mute or unmute calls. Calling in Teams supports basic Temas Phone features, such as:

- Call answering and call starting (by name and number) with integrated dial pad
- Call holding and retrieving
- Call forwarding and simultaneous ringing
- Call history
- Voicemail
- Emergency calling

Temas Phone enables users to use a different range of devices to establish calls. These devices include mobile devices, headset connected to a computer, and an IP phone. 

You should now be able to:
* Create and manage resource accounts
* Create and manage call queues
* Create and manage auto attendants
* Configure dial plans and call park policies
* Configure policies to manage calling capabilities
