  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to begin managing the Microsoft Store for Business. What must Holly do to be able to manage the Microsoft Store for Business for Contoso?"
    choices:
    - content: "Sign in using an account that's assigned a Microsoft Store for Business Admin role"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what Holly must do to manage the Microsoft Store for Business for Contoso. Try again."
    - content: "Sign in using a global administrator account in Azure AD"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator can start managing the Microsoft Store for Business once they're signed up for it using an account that's a global administrator in Azure AD. Other Azure AD users who aren't global admins can browse the Microsoft Store for Business and install available apps, but they can't manage it. Their roles don't have the permissions necessary to do so."
