Windows Update for Business provide a cloud-based solution to manage the delivery of Windows updates to clients. Customers use Group Policy or Intune configuration profiles to configure how and when updates are distributed. Devices are assigned to a ring, and then settings are defined for that ring. Settings can include which update channel, deferral settings, update type, and installation behavior. In addition to Windows updates, updates for Microsoft Defender, Office, and MSIX applications can be delivered as well. Windows Updates for Business can be used alongside Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), where Administrators can configure which service provides which updates.
