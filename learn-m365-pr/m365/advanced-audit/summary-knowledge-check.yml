      - content: "Content explorer "
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Content explorer shows a current snapshot of the items that have a sensitivity label, a retention label, or have been classified as a sensitive information type. "
      - content: "Sensitive info types"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sensitive info types are where you manage the built-in and custom sensitive information types available to classify data.  "

        explanation: "The more supporting evidence you have, the higher the likelihood that a match contains the sensitive information you're looking for. You can assign higher levels of confidence for matches that are detected by using more evidence."
      - content: "You can use exact data match (EDM) for your custom sensitive information type that utilizes pattern matching."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Exact Data Match (EDM) enhances custom sensitive information types to help accurately target detection of exact data values, instead of pattern matching."
      - content: "You need to create a new sensitive information type for custom data because you cannot directly modify the default rules. "
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You cannot directly modify the default rules."
      
    - content: "Which of the following can be completed from the data classification overview page? "
      choices:
      - content: "Filter by label or sensitive type to get a detailed view of locations where data is stored."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can search for specific sensitive information types, sensitivity labels or retention labels, or browse to the one you are interested in via the content explorer."
      - content: "Filter to see all the details for a specific label including file types, users, and activities. "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Activity explorer enables you to understand what is being done with your labeled content over time. You can use activity explorer to evaluate if the controls already in place, such as data loss prevention policies, are effective. "
      - content: "Monitor risky activities associated with sensitive information to inform DLP policies."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The data classification overview page provides snapshots of how sensitive info and labels are being used across your organization's locations. The overview page shows volume of sensitive data across Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business, categorized by sensitive information types such as social security number (SSN), or associated with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."

      choices:
      - content: "Locations where retention labels are applied."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "The locations where retention labels are applied card shows the number of items with a retention label applied grouped by location."

    - content: "Trainable classifiers use which of the following to identify what an item actually is?  "
      choices:
      - content: "Metadata"

        explanation: "Unlike pattern matching, trainable classifiers do not look at metadata."
      - content: "Machine learning"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Trainable classifiers use machine learning to identify what an item actually is. It does this by analyzing hundreds of examples of a type of content (such as an invoice), which you provide to the engine."
