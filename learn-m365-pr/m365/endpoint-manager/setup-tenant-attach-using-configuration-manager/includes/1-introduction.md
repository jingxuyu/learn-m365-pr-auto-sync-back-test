Managing your organization's resources can be complex. However, Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you by providing a single, modern, integrated management platform for managing, protecting, and monitoring all of your organization's endpoints. Endpoints include mobile devices, desktop computers, and apps that an organization uses. These endpoints may also include the on premises computers used by an organization. Microsoft Endpoint Manager is the overall management platform you can use to manage your organization's endpoints. Both Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager are part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

Suppose that you're the administrator or business decision maker of a company with several thousand employees. You need to keep your corporate data safe by protecting data, apps, and devices that your employees use, as well as keep your employees productive and maximize the return on your endpoint management investment. You and your company have determined that you need to manage both on-premises endpoints, as well as cloud-based endpoints. Microsoft Endpoint Manager provides this capability by using cloud attach.

In this module, you'll step through the process of setting up cloud attach (tenant-attach and co-management). Also, this module provides the details you need to know to understand what's involved when implementing cloud attach. When you're complete, you'll have a better understanding of cloud attach, tenant-attach, and co-management. All of these steps will prepare you to add and manage devices and apps, whether these endpoints are on-premises, or cloud-based.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will:

- Understand tenant-attach
- Confirm tenant-attach prerequisites
