Deploy the applications and policies designed for your classroom from the cloud using Intune for Education to ensure the right applications are delivered to the right devices at the right times. Once user groups are defined, ensure the right applications are delivered to the right devices with Intune for Education. To get started, follow the steps below:

1. **Choose a group to configure** using Express Configuration in Intune for Education. You'll be able to select from all your Intune and SDS groups, but we recommend starting with All Users.
