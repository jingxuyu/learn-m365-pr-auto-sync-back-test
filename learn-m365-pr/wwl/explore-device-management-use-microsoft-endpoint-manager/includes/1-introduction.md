As part of device management, Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps organizations:

 -  protect device data
 -  manage policy assignments
 -  ensure proper device access
 -  implement device security rules
 -  resolve device compliance issues

All devices that an organization manages have a lifecycle. Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager can help you manage this lifecycle: from enrollment, through configuration and protection, to retiring the device when it's no longer required.

Suppose that you're the administrator of a company with several thousand employees. Your company requires that all new devices be set up to easily connect to your corporate network before they reach the respective employee. Also, each device must be enrolled into a mobile device management solution so it can be protected. In addition, all of these devices must meet your company's security requirements. These requirements must be implemented for all devices that access your corporate data, whether the device is company owned or personally owned.

In this module, you'll learn about the key features of Microsoft Endpoint Manager. You'll be introduced to Microsoft Intune, Configuration Manager, and device co-management. You'll examine how to manage devices using both Configuration Manager and Intune. You'll also learn how to create configuration profiles for devices using Intune.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the device management capabilities found in Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
 -  Describe how Windows devices can be co-managed in Endpoint Manager using Configuration Manager and Intune.
 -  Manage devices using Configuration Manager.
 -  Manage devices using Microsoft Intune.
 -  Create device profiles in Microsoft Intune.
