Add any info you want here. You can also copy this MD file and use for other units - just be sure that your file name is descriptive of the content. 

You'll also need one YAML file per unit (in directory above this) - start by copying the 1-introduction.yml file. Anywhere that you see "1-introduction", replace it with the new file that you created. This should prevent too many build issues.

If you'd prefer to not deal with files and structure - feel free to have all your new content here - just use headings to separate, then I can break up into individual files and accompnanying YAML files.

The other files in this directory are the source for the **Explore Windows as a service** module. Feel free to edit away. I have another, protected copy of that module, should things go sideways.

Let me know if you have any issues.
