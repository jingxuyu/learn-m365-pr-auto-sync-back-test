In this module, you were introduced to five archetypes of Teams rooms management: unmanaged, all on-premises, hybrid, all online, and Teams Rooms Premium. A highlight of the tools was given for each of these archetypes.

You were then introduced to what PowerShell can do with Teams Rooms, such as collecting the system logs and reporting on device connectivity.

SkypeSettings.xml is a file that can be used to configure Teams Rooms settings. If you can set a value on the Teams Rooms console, you can also set it via SkypeSettings.xml.

Finally, you were introduced to the capabilities that Teams admin center brings to Teams Rooms. Teams admin center is a powerful tool for inventorying, managing, and troubleshooting Teams Rooms.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Differentiate between the available management options.
- Understand which tools to use and when to use them.
- Troubleshoot poor participant audio in a Teams Rooms meeting.
