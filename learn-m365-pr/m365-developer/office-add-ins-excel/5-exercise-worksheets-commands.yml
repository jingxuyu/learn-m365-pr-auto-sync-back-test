      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "`context.workbook.worksheets.getCurrent().getNext().activate()`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `getActiveWorksheet()` method to get a reference to the current worksheet. The `getCurrent()` method doesn't exist on the `worksheets` property."

  - content: "To call a JavaScript function from a button in the Office application's ribbon defined in the add-in's manifest, you must do which of the following?"
    choices:
    - content: "Include the JavaScript function in the add-in's JavaScript file. This function must be in the global scope so the Office.js API can call it directly from the ribbon."

      explanation: "The JavaScript function is defined in a file separate from the add-in JavaScript file; it isn't added to the add-in's JavaScript file."
    - content: "First, create an HTML file that implements `Office.initialize` and contains a global JavaScript function. Next, reference the file in the manifest's `<Resources>` section. Finally, call the function using the `<Action>` type `ExecuteFunction`, and specify the function by its name."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "First, create an HTML file that implements `Office.initialize` and contains a global JavaScript function. Next, call the function using the `<Action>` type `ExecuteFunction`, and specify the function by its name."
      isCorrect: false
