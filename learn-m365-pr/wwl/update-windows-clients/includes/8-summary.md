Windows updates can be delivered by way of several different methods. Windows Update settings within the Windows client can be managed in the Settings app. The Windows Server Update Services role on a Windows Server can be used to manage updates and deploy them on test clients before rolling updates out to the production environment. Updates can be deferred to give IT time to test updates. Group Policy can be used to manage client settings at scale.
