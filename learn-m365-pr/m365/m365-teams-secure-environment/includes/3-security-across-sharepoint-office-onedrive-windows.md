Because Teams works in partnership with SharePoint, OneNote, Exchange, and more, you should be comfortable managing security in Microsoft 365 all-up. Data location is a key piece of information to know.

## Datacenters and in-region data storage

Data in Teams resides in the geographic region associated with your Microsoft 365 organization. Currently, Teams supports the Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland (which includes Liechtenstein), the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Americas, APAC, and EMEA regions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Teams currently offers data residency in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, South Korea, South Africa, and Switzerland (which includes Liechtenstein) for new tenants only. A new tenant is defined as any tenant that hasn't had a single user from the tenant sign-in to Teams. Existing tenants from Australia, India, Japan, and South Korea will continue to have their Teams data stored in the APAC region. Existing tenants in Canada will continue to have their data stored in the Americas. Existing tenants in France, Germany, Liechtenstein, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Switzerland will have their data stored in the EMEA region.
