    - content: "Deleting a team removes any chats or content that was kept under compliance policies"

      explanation: "That's correct. Channels also have a \"soft delete\" and can be reversed for up to 21 days after deletion. Deleting a channel won't delete the folder or its contents from the SharePoint document library."
  - content: "Which identity model supported by Microsoft Teams requires a synchronized identity where the user password is verified by the on-premises identity provider?"
    choices:
    - content: "Federated identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This model requires a synchronized identity where the user password is verified by the on-premises identity provider. With this model, the password hash isn't synchronized to Azure AD because Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or a third-party identity provider is used to authenticate users against the on-premises Active Directory."
    - content: "Cloud identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this model, a user is created and managed in Microsoft 365. The user account is stored in Azure Active Directory (AD) and only exists there. Try again."
    - content: "Synchronized identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In this model, the user identity is managed in an on-premises server, and the account and its password hash are synchronized to the cloud. Try again."

    choices:
    - content: "Turn on all Microsoft Teams features at the individual user-level through the Teams admin center"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Specific Microsoft Teamsâ€™ features can't be turned on or off at an individual user level. Try again."
    - content: "Set the tenant-wide Microsoft Teams option in Org-wide settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. There is no Microsoft Teams option in the org-wide settings. Try again."
    - content: "Assign an Office 365 Enterprise E3 or E5 license to each user"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. When a license SKU such as Office 365 Enterprise E3 or E5 is assigned to a user, a Microsoft Teams license is automatically assigned to the user. This license enables the user to use Microsoft Teams."
