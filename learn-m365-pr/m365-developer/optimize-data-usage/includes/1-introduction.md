**Microsoft Graph** provides a unified programmability model that you can use to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with the data of millions of users. Microsoft Graph APIs implements many of the OData protocolâ€™s query parameters. In this module, you'll learn how to manipulate queries using query parameters.

Query parameters will help you achieve multiple tasks such as limiting the amount of data returned by requests to Microsoft Graph such as controlling how many fields are returned for each record, how many records are returned, also filtering and searching for wanted information.

This module will also cover other query parameters that can be used for combining multiple requests in a single HTTP request. Combining requests is done by leveraging batching and expanding related items to avoid additional HTTP round-trips to Microsoft Graph.
