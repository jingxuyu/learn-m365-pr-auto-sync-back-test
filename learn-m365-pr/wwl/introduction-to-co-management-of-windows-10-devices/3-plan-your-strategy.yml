  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson has identified many Windows 10 devices throughout the organization that don't have the Configuration Manager client installed. Holly had Contoso's developers create an app to deploy the Configuration Manager client on these devices. After the app was run, which service is managing all the workloads on these devices that now have co-management enabled?"
    choices:
    - content: "Intune"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. After enabling co-management on these devices, this isn't the service that will manage all workloads. Try again."
    - content: "Azure AD"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. After enabling co-management on these devices, this isn't the service that will manage all workloads. Try again."
    - content: "Configuration Manager"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After you enable co-management, Configuration Manager continues to manage all workloads. When you decide that you're ready, Intune can start managing available workloads."
