    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Microsoft 365 includes capabilities that can be applied to specific types of data to protect information. Which capability allows users to identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across M365."
      choices:
      - content: "Sensitivity labels   "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "With sensitivity labels you can classify and help protect your sensitive content. Protection options include labels, watermarks, and encryption."
      - content: "Sensitive information types"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Sensitive information types define how the automated process recognizes specific information types such as health service numbers and credit card numbers."
      - content: "Data loss prevention (DLP)"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "With DLP policies, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365. Data loss prevention policies can use sensitivity labels and sensitive information types to identify sensitive information. "

    - content: "During which step of the information protection transition process do you determine if you want to keep your existing policies or start over with new ones?"
      choices:
      - content: "Copy policies "
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Once your labels have been migrated to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, determine if you want to copy your existing policies or start over with new ones."
      - content: "Activate unified labeling"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Activation copies the labels from the Azure Information Protection store to the Microsoft Purview Information Protection unified labeling store."
      - content: "Manage from compliance portal "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Any policies copied in the previous step will already be published. However, you may want to edit those existing policies or create new ones. Policies are not visible until they are published, and the recommendation is to edit policies for the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. "
      
    - content: "What is a key consideration for activating unified labeling and migrating labels to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal?"
      choices:
      - content: "If you create labels in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal with the same name as your existing Azure Information Protection labels, you won't be able to migrate those labels later."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "To avoid conflicts, we recommend you first migrate your labels from Azure Information Protection."
      - content: "Unified labeling clients do not see any labels until you **publish** a label policy."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This does not happen during unified labeling activation."
      - content: "You must edit policies for clients using unified labeling in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. "
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Remember, labels are not visible until they are published."
      
    - content: "The classic client and unified labeling client must be installed separately from Office. What benefit results from separate installations?"
      choices:
      - content: "Integrating with Office and Outlook"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Each client integrates with Office and Outlook."
      - content: "Classifying and protection files outside Office and Outlook"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You cannot classify and protect files outside of Office with the Office built-in labeling client."
      - content: "Running multiple clients on the same machine"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You can use different clients on different Windows devices to support different business requirements, but you cannot use more than one of the clients on the same machine."
