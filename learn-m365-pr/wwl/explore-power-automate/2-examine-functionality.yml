  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson was approached by one of Contoso's users who complained they could not create a specific flow in Power Automate. The flow would schedule an automated daily data upload to SharePoint. Which of the following reasons would be a possible explanation as to why the user was unable to create this flow?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user was attempting to create a UI flow"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The flow type wouldn't explain why the user can't create this flow. Try again."
    - content: "Automated daily data uploads can only be made to Exchange"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't a valid reason as to why the user couldn't create the flow. Try again."
    - content: "The user doesn't have permission to schedule an automated daily data upload to SharePoint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Power Automate doesn't circumvent security in any way. If the user doesn't have permission to do a certain action, the user can't build a flow to do that same action."
