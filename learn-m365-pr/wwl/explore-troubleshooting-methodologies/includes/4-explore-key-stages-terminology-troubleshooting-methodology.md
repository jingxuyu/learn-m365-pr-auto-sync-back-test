The details and terminology of various troubleshooting methodologies can vary, and there are no precise processes for troubleshooting computer-related problems. However, most methodologies share some common processes, procedures, and terminology, which this topic identifies.

#### Classification

When an end user first discovers and reports a computer problem, a series of classification processes begins. During these processes, you gather information from the end user in an attempt to establish the problem’s nature and scope. The initial discussion might reveal information that results in an immediate resolution to the problem, but with more complex or serious problems, you must continue to troubleshoot the issue to resolve it.

Problems that affect many end users are more serious in terms of their impact on organizational productivity, and you must resolve them more quickly. Classification allows you time to determine the scope and impact of problems so that you can prioritize them.

Even if you are immediately able to resolve a problem, you must log the problem by using your organization’s methodology. Appropriate logging procedures ensure that you do not lose any incident reports. Access to detailed incident reports allows organizations to monitor their IT systems more effectively and make informed decisions about those systems.

#### Test

When you have prioritized and logged a reported incident, the testing phase starts. During the testing phase, you use a number of processes to determine the probable cause of a reported problem. You might start by listing the possible causes. Typically, you might try to divide and isolate these possible causes.

In computer systems, dividing and isolating possible causes might mean making a distinction between:

 -  Server and workstation-related issues
 -  Hardware and software
 -  Operating systems and applications

You can eliminate possible causes with this process, which in turn allows you to determine probable causes.

When you reduce the list of possible causes to a manageable number, you can start a testing process. The testing process helps you determine the probable cause of the problem as you work through your list of potential causes.

One way to troubleshoot an issue is to reproduce the problem in a test environment. If you can reproduce a problem easily, you likely can determine the probable cause. If a problem is more difficult to reproduce, you must study your results, and perhaps modify your initial thoughts about the problem’s probable cause.

#### Escalation

If you cannot determine a resolution during the initial testing phase, you must either consult additional documentation or escalate the problem. If you suspect that the issue stems from a component, you can escalate the problem to the component’s manufacturer. For other issues, you can escalate the issue within your organization, if you have the requisite internal resources. Your organization should have an established process for escalating reported incidents to your organization’s second-tier support staff. The second-tier support staff then asks questions to classify the problem’s scope and assign it a priority level.

#### Report

When you resolve an incident, you must document the resolution. Recording any changes to your IT system’s configuration is an important step. Problems often reoccur, and when you document them properly, you can save time resolving subsequent occurrences of the same problem.
