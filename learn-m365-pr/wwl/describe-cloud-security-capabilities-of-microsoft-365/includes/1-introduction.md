As enterprises move more of their workloads to the cloud, it has never been more important to protect cross-cloud resources. Microsoft, in its unique position as both a cloud provider and security vendor, has built comprehensive cloud security to protect every layer of the cloud across Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), regardless of which cloud or cloud apps you use.

In this module, you will:

- Explore the Cloud App Security Framework.
- Discover the capabilities of Microsoft Cloud Application Security (MCAS).
