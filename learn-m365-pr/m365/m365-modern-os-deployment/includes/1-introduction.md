To successfully deploy Windows 10 in your organization, you need to understand the different deployment methods, especially now that there are new scenarios to consider. Choosing among these scenarios, and understanding the capabilities and limitations of each, is a key task.

## Should you upgrade or migrate?

You can migrate files and application settings to new hardware running Windows 10 or keep them on the computer you’re upgrading.

You should upgrade if:
-	You have existing computers running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1, x64. Because existing applications are preserved, the upgrade process uses the standard Windows installation media image (Install.wim) instead of a custom image.

You should migrate if:
-	You are changing from Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1 x86 to Windows 10 x64. The upgrade process can’t change from a 32-bit operating system to a 64-bit operating system, because of possible complications with installed applications and drivers.

In this module we review different deployment scenarios, methods, and tools.
