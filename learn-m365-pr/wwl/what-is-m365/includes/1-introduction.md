## What is Microsoft 365?

Microsoft 365 empowers users with the latest innovation across new and familiar productivity experiences like Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Windows. Unlike other productivity services, Microsoft 365 learns from users and collects valuable insights through the Microsoft Graph to deliver enhanced experiences that continually get better over time and keep users protected.  Microsoft 365 empowers organizations with the following capabilities: 

|Capability|Description|
|-|-|
|Productivity and Teamwork|Includes instant messaging and online meetings with Microsoft Teams, email and calendaring with Outlook, familiar Office apps on all devices, advanced file storage and sharing with OneDrive, intranet and team sites, and enterprise social networks with Yammer. |
|Business Management|Includes simplified IT management with Microsoft Endpoint Manager, business process automation, extensibility with Teams and Power Platform, business voice and phone system with Teams, Forms and workflow management, business intelligence with Workplace Analytics, and work management with Project Online. | 
|Security and Compliance|Includes solutions for identity and access management, information protection and governance, threat protection, security management, insider risk management, compliance management, and eDiscovery.| 

Some Microsoft 365 components, like Microsoft 365 Apps and Windows, are delivered using the **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** model. SaaS is software thatâ€™s centrally hosted and managed by a **cloud service provider (CSP)** for customers. In general, CSPs provide one version of an app for all customers and license it through a monthly or annual subscription.
