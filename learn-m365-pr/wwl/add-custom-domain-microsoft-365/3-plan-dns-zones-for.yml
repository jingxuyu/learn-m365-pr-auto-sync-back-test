  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, you're planning a Microsoft 365 deployment. You want to add a new custom domain where the internal DNS zone and external DNS zone have the same name. You want to design a DNS solution for the new domain that enables Microsoft 365 connectivity and meets this DNS requirement. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Configure split brain DNS"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Split brain DNS is a configuration in which the internal and external DNS environments provide different IP addresses to requests for the same host name, depending on which server is used for name resolution."
    - content: "Use DNS zones that are Active Directory integrated"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action won't meet your DNS requirements. Try again."
    - content: "Use a primary zone for the domain for external use and a secondary zone that points to the primary zone for the internal use"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action won't meet your DNS requirements. Try again."
