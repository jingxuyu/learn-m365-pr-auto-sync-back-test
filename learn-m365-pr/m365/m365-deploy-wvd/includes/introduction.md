In this module, we’ll explain how to deploy your first Windows Virtual Desktop host pool and virtual machines.  

As we walk through the Azure Resource Manager template used to provision WVD host pools, we’ll walk through your options for:  
- Creating pooled or personal virtual machines 
- Image selection and Windows images available in the gallery  
- Domain-joined user accounts versus service identities. 

The Windows Virtual Desktop host pool by default will configure a remote desktop for specified user accounts. The experiences that users can choose are app groups, and we’ll show how to modify the apps and desktop experiences available to users.
