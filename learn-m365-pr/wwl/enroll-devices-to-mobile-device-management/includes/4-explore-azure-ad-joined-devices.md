Any organization can deploy Azure AD joined devices no matter the size or industry. Azure AD join works even in hybrid environments, enabling access to both cloud and on-premises apps and resources. The following table summarizes the features of Azure AD joined devices.

Users can sign-in to Azure AD joined devices using an organizational Azure AD account. Access to resources can be controlled based on Azure AD account policies and [Conditional Access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-compliant-device?azure-portal=true) applied to the device.

Administrators can secure and further control Azure AD joined devices using either:

 -  Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools like Microsoft Intune.
 -  Co-management scenarios using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.

These tools provide a means to enforce organization-required configurations, such as:

 -  Requiring storage to be encrypted.
 -  Password complexity.
 -  Software installation.
 -  Software updates.

Azure AD join can be accomplished using self-service options like the Out of Box Experience (OOBE), bulk enrollment, or Windows Autopilot. Azure AD joined devices can still maintain single sign-on access to on-premises resources when they're on the organization's network. Devices that are Azure AD joined can still authenticate to on-premises servers such file servers, print servers, and other application servers.

### Scenarios

Azure AD join can be used in various scenarios, such as when an organization:

 -  Wants to transition to a cloud-based infrastructure using Azure AD and a Mobile Device Management solution such as Intune.
 -  Canâ€™t use an on-premises domain join. For example, the organization needs to get mobile devices such as tablets and phones under control.
 -  Has users who must access Microsoft 365 or other SaaS apps integrated with Azure AD.
 -  Wants to manage a specific group of users in Azure AD instead of its on-premises Active Directory. This scenario can apply, for example, to seasonal workers, contractors, or students.
 -  Wants to provide joining capabilities to workers who work from home or are in remote branch offices with limited on-premises infrastructure.

An organization can configure Azure AD join for all Windows 10 and 11 devices, except for Home editions.

The goal of Azure AD joined devices is to simplify:

 -  Windows deployments of work-owned devices.
 -  Access to organizational apps and resources from any Windows device.
 -  Cloud-based management of work-owned devices.
 -  User sign-in to their devices with their Azure AD or synced Active Directory work or school accounts.
