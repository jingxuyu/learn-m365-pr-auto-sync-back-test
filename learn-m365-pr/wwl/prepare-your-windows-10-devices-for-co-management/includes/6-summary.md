This module examined how Co-management enables organizations to use modern management features with their current devices. These features include conditional access and strong authentication by using Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).

In this module, you learned that there are two ways to prepare your existing environment for Co-management:

 -  **If your devices are currently managed by Configuration Manager, but not yet by Intune, you must enroll them to Intune.** Depending on size of your company, you can achieve this goal is several different ways. For example, you can use provisioning packages, manual enrollment, or enrolling them by using Configuration Manager.
 -  **If your devices are currently managed by Intune, but not yet by Configuration Manager, you must install the Configuration Manager client on the devices.** You can install the client in several different ways. For example, you can use Intune app deployment or manual installation.

This module described how new devices can include the Configuration Manager client and can be automatically enrolled to Intune during the deployment. You also learned that integrating Configuration Manager and Intune forms the basis of Co-management.
