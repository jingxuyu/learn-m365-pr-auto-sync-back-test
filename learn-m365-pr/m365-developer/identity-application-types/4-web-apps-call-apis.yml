  title: Web apps that sign in users and call APIs
  description: In this unit, you’ll learn how to create server-side web apps that allow users to sign in and grant the app permissions to act on the user’s behalf. Once the user has authenticated and granted the app consent to act on their behalf, the web application will use data returned from Microsoft Graph by using the OAuth 2.0 auth code grant flow.
