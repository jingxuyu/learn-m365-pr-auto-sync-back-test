R is an open-source programming language known for its active user community and wide range of packages that together enable the quick and effective implementation of data science techniques. You can use the *wpa R package* to analyze metrics at a level of detail that might not be included in the available downloadable out-of-the-box dashboards in Workplace Analytics. 

Imagine you are a data analyst on an HR business intelligence team who has been using Workplace Analytics Power BI dashboards and queries to analyze collaboration across your organization. You are interested in finding new techniques for advanced analysis and alternatives for visualizing data that are easy to incorporate into a data science workflow. To date, you have been using the available Power BI dashboards for reporting, and while they are valuable, you see an opportunity to create more flexible analysis and incorporate more advanced analysis techniques.

To enable this flexibility and advanced analysis, you install R, RStudio Desktop, and begin to use the *wpa R package* to analyze Workplace Analytics data. The package includes multiple functions for advanced analysis and reporting. Incorporating these features into a data science workflow provides a way for you share deep insights into employee working patterns with leaders in your organization.

## Learning objectives

In this module, youâ€™ll learn to:
