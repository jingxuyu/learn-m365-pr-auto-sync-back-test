In the Zero Trust model, identity, endpoints, applications, network, infrastructure, and data are important components that work together to provide end-to-end security. The Zero Trust approach advocates protection at each layer as they could be vulnerable entry points for cybercriminals to exploit. Zero Trust isn't a service or a device that works with an on and off switch. It's a strategy or a plan that's deployed after a detailed assessment of all critical data, assets, applications, and services within an organization. By analyzing your systems, environments, and infrastructure, you can determine how everything is connected and then plan to execute with Zero Trust. The Zero Trust model is a step-by-step methodology that is deployed across all domains with minimal disruption to day-to-day operations. By adopting a Zero Trust approach, you can build a strategy around its six key components.

## Identities

An identity in the Zero Trust framework is defined as users, services, applications, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In the Zero Trust model, identities control and administer access to critical data and resources. This means that when an identity attempts to access a resource, organizations must verify it through strong authentication methods, ensure access is compliant and typical for that identity, and enforce least privilege access principles.

## Endpoints

An endpoint is any device that connects to your network whether in the cloud, on-premises, or remotely. They include devices issued by the organization, IoT devices, smartphones, BYODs, and partner and guest devices. In the Zero Trust approach, the security policies are enforced uniformly across all endpoints. This is because when an identity is granted access to a resource, data can stream across different endpoints. If the endpoints aren't secure, this can create a huge risk.

## Applications

Applications are the means by which users access their data. Knowing how these apps and their application programming interfaces work is essential to understanding, managing, and controlling the flow of data. All apps used across your digital estate should be given tightly controlled in-app permissions and be monitored for abnormal behavior.

## Networks

Networks represent the means to access our data. Using network access controls and monitoring user and device behavior in real time can provide insights and visibility into threats and help cybercriminals to move laterally across your network. Network segmentation, using threat detection and prevention tools, and encrypting network traffic will reduce the likelihood of an attack and mitigate the fallout from a breach.

## Infrastructure

Your infrastructure covers every aspect of the digital domain, from on-premises servers to cloud-based virtual machines. The main focus and consideration for infrastructure is to manage the configuration and keep software updated. A robust configuration management approach will ensure that all deployed devices meet the minimum security and policy requirements.

## Data

Understanding your data and then applying the correct level of access control is essential if you want to protect it. But it goes further than that. By limiting access, and by implementing strong data usage policies, and using real-time monitoring, you can restrict or block sharing of sensitive data and files.
