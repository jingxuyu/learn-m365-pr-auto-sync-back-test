  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Patti Fernandez wants to give one of Lucerne's users, Allan Deyoung, the minimum level of privileges that will enable Allan to search the Microsoft 365 audit log. Patti assigned Allan the View-Only Audit Logs role on the Permissions page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center. However, after doing so, Allan still wasn't able to search the Microsoft 365 audit log. Why wasn't Allan able to search the audit log?"
    choices:
    - content: "Patti should have assigned Allan the Audit Logs role instead"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the reason why Allan couldn't search the audit log. Try again."
    - content: "Patti didn't turn on audit logging for Allan's mailbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Turning on audit logging would have enabled Allan's activity in Exchange Online to be logged, but it has no bearing on whether Allan can search the audit log. Try again."
    - content: "Patti should have assigned the View-Only Audit Logs role in Exchange Online"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If you assign a user either the View-Only Audit Logs role or the Audit Logs role on the Permissions page in the Microsoft 365 compliance center, they won't be able to search the Microsoft 365 audit log. The permissions must be assigned in Exchange Online rather than the Microsoft 365 compliance center because the underlying cmdlet used to search the audit log is an Exchange Online cmdlet."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to enable auditing as part of an information management policy in SharePoint Online. To ensure the information policy is applied to all documents of a certain type within a site collection, Holly plans to create the policy at the site collection level and then later apply the policy to content types. To create a site collection policy for multiple content types, what's the first thing that Holly must do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Activate the Site Policy feature for the site collection"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To create a policy for multiple content types, you must first activate the Site Policy feature for the site collection."
    - content: "Run the Set-AdminAuditLogConfig cmdlet in PowerShell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the first thing Holly should do before creating a site collection policy. Try again."
    - content: "On the Site Settings page for the site collection, select the Enable Auditing checkbox"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option can be selected at the time you create the site collection policy. It's not the first thing Holly must do before creating the policy. Try again."
  - content: "After an audit log search has finished running, the search results are loaded. After a few moments, the results are displayed. How are the search results displayed?"
    choices:
    - content: "All the results will be displayed in increments of 150 events"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item doesn't correctly describe how the search results are displayed. Try again."
    - content: "A maximum of 1500 events will be displayed in increments of 150 events (10 pages worth of events)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item doesn't correctly describe how the search results are displayed.  Try again."
    - content: "A maximum of 5000 events will be displayed in increments of 150 events"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A maximum of 5000 events will be displayed in increments of 150 events. If more than 5000 events meet the search criteria, only the most recent 5000 events are displayed."
