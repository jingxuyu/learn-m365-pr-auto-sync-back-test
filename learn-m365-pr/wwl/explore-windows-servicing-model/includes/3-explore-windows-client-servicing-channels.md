### Windows Servicing Channels

To align with the new method of delivering feature updates and quality updates in Windows client, Microsoft introduced the concept of servicing channels to allow customers to designate how frequently their individual devices are updated. For example, an organization may have test devices that the IT department can update with new features as soon as possible, and then, specialized devices that require a longer feature update cycle to ensure continuity.

Microsoft has implemented the following servicing options for Windows 10 and later:

    For many IT pros, gaining visibility into feature updates early—before they’re available to the General Availability Channel—can be both intriguing and valuable for future end-user communications as well as provide the means to test for application compatibility and any other issues on the next General Availability Channel release. Feature flighting enables Windows Insiders to consume and deploy preproduction code to their test machines, gaining early visibility into the next build.

    In the General Availability servicing channel, feature updates are available as soon as Microsoft releases them. This servicing model is ideal for pilot deployments and testing of Windows feature updates and for users such as developers who need to work with the latest features immediately. Once the latest release went through pilot deployment and testing, you choose the timing at which it goes into broad deployment.

    Long-Term Servicing Channel

    Specialized systems—such as PCs that control medical equipment, point-of-sale systems, and ATMs—often require a longer servicing option because of their purpose. It’s more important that these devices be kept as stable and secure as possible than up to date with user interface changes. The LTSC servicing model prevents Windows Enterprise LTSC devices from receiving the usual feature updates and provides only quality updates to ensure that device security stays up to date. The Long-term Servicing Channel is available only in the Windows Enterprise LTSC edition.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Enterprise LTSC is a separate Long-Term Servicing Channel version. Long-term Servicing channel is not intended for deployment on most or all the PCs in an organization; it should be used only for special-purpose devices. As a general guideline, a PC with Microsoft Office installed is a general-purpose device, typically used by an information worker, and therefore it is better suited for the General Availability channel.
