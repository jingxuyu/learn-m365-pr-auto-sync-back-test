When a device is joined to a domain, users can access company resources without having to enter their credentials every time they access company resources. Users can have a similar experience from a device that you enable for Device Registration, but without requiring the device to be a domain member. Device Registration provides an Single Sign-On (SSO) experience when accessing internal company websites and company apps. Users with domain accounts can implement Device Registration on their personal devices, if their company has the appropriate infrastructure in place.
