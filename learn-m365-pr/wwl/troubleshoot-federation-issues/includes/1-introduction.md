You work for an enterprise-level organization. Most users in your organization have upgraded to Microsoft Teams, but some still use Skype for Business for their meetings and communication. Although your organization has a programme to migrate all users to Teams, until everyone has upgraded you must manage issues that arise from using both systems.

In this module we will discuss federation and interoperability between Teams and Skype for Business.

**Federation** is the term used for communicating with users outside of your organization using Skype for Business or Teams.  

**Interoperability** is the term used for communication between a Skype for Business user and a Teams user.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand how to troubleshoot interoperability issues between Teams and Skype for Business, or Skype.
- Understand how to troubleshoot federation issues, including federation policies and domain lists.
