Creating and finding a wide range of content requires knowledge and expertise in different fields, subjects, and technologies available across your organization. It's unlikely that a Search admin, or even an IT admin team, will have the requisite expertise or knowledge to create authoritative content for the large variety of topics their users search for.

To provide the breadth, depth, and quality of answer content that users will likely expect, Search admins should use the expertise and knowledge of people across their organization. We suggest bringing together a team of key stakeholders to help define and provide the answer content that's needed, and evangelize and drive adoption of Microsoft Search within their teams or groups.

The table below outlines some of the key people who can help you in the planning and rollout phase:

   | Stakeholder                 | Role |
   | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
   | **Executive sponsor**                                        | Can help communicate high-level vision and how Microsoft Search contributes to and supports the core mission and priorities of the organization. Provides leadership to the stakeholder team and can help allocate resources. |
   | **Change management experts**                                               | Can help determine the process, reviews, and sign offs that may be required to deploy Microsoft Search across the organization. Support internal campaigns and communications to increase awareness and drive adoption of Microsoft Search.  |
   | **Subject matter experts (SMEs)** | Experts from different teams and functional areas, such as HR, sales, legal, privacy, product or business teams, support, and other key areas can contribute to, or even help create, answer content specific to their groups. Search admins might consider adding them as Search editors or they can compile content that can later be imported. SMEs can also help test search functionality to ensure answers are being correctly triggered and evaluate the overall quality of the search results. |
   | **Champions and/or users**                                         | Users that are interested in internal search can give unique insight into how people use search within your organization, suggest and help prioritize answer content and sources, and provide peer-to-peer assistance and expertise.
