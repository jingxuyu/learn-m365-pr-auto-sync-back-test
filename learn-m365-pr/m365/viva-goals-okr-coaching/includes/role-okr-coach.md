First, think about a time when you worked with a coach. It could have been a sports coach, executive coach, or even a lifestyle coach. What did they do that was helpful for you? 

Coaches play a part in many of the achievements that happen all over the world. Behind every Olympic athlete is a knowledgeable and committed coach; the same is true with professional sports players, business executives, and others. Excellent coaches help people identify and achieve their goals. 

How does this relate to an OKR coach? Well, a good OKR coach embodies those same traits that help people identify their goals and lay out a clear path for how they'll achieve them. 

An OKR coach is a facilitator who can guide a group of people to identify what their goals are by asking thought-provoking questions and ensuring great OKRs are created through the process. An OKR coach can help coach their own team or organization in the creation and use of OKRs, but they also can help other teams as well.  You don’t need to be an expert in a specific area to help coach on OKRs, the facilitation tactics we’ll review today are applicable to any team.   

Let’s start with a little more specificity around the role of an OKR coach.  

You **ARE** there to: 

- Ask questions and guide conversation. 

- Provide feedback on their OKRs. 

- Ensure great OKRs come out of the working session. 

You **ARE NOT** there to: 

- Develop their OKRs for them. 

An effectively facilitated working session can be one of the most powerful ways to bring alignment across an organization.

A point we want to be clear on, you aren't there to create their OKRs for them. You'll be equipped with a set of questions to help you help them in defining their goals, but it's crucial that each team develop their own OKRs. This increases ownership and ensures OKR accuracy.
