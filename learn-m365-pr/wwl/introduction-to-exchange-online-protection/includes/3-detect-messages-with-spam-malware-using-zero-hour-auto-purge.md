Zero-hour auto purge (ZAP) is an email protection feature in the Exchange Online Protection service. ZAP detects messages with spam or malware that previously went undetected and were delivered to users' inboxes. ZAP's ability to detect infected messages is usually because of evolving heuristic and delivery patterns, and content that is weaponized after being delivered to users.

ZAP mitigates malicious email by continually monitoring updates to the Microsoft 365 spam and malware signatures. It can also identify malicious messages that previously went undetected and are already in users' Inboxes. If the recipients haven't read the messages and ZAP has identified the mail as spam, then ZAP moves the messages to the users' Junk email folders. For newly detected malware, ZAP removes the attachments from the email message, even if the mail was not read. The reverse is true for messages that were incorrectly classified as malicious (in other words, false negatives). For example, if a message was flagged as spam and delivered to the user's Junk mail folder, ZAP would move the message to the user's Inbox.
