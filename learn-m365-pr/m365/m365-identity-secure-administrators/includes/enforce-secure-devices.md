# Enforce secure devices

## Ensure that administrators use compliant devices

You should ensure that devices used for administrative tasks comply with your security policies. For example, an organization might require users to access sensitive resources only by using devices that are managed by your organization.

With Azure AD Conditional Access, you can require an administratorâ€™s device be registered with Azure AD and identified as compliant by Microsoft Intune.

A device that Azure AD marks as compliant ensures that it:

- Is managed by your organization.
- Complies with company security requirements.
