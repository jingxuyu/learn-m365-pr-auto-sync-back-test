Getting proper buy in from your organization’s key stakeholders is necessary for employing Syntex throughout the organization and successful content understanding. Syntex thrives when all the necessary parties are aligned and aware of how they can utilize Syntex and contribute to the success of their organization’s content understanding processes.

Contoso Electronics is comprised of multiple roles – from leadership to departmental management to the executors themselves.  

Here, you will learn which stakeholders should be considered for putting Syntex into practice and how they contribute to adoption, as well as what these stakeholders look like within Contoso Electronics.  

## What stakeholders are necessary for actuating SharePoint Syntex?

### Executive/Leadership

‘Buy-in’ and endorsement at the executive level will be key to ensuring that all other stakeholders are invested in Syntex and aligned on the greater goal or mission for implementing more efficient content understanding. Leadership will already have a clear idea of what the entire company’s goals and values are, allowing them to align implementing Syntex with these more easily and clearly. And of course, much of the company looks to the executive team for direction and trusts their buy in, making it easier to adopt and support Syntex throughout the entire company.  

A CEO or Chief Operating Officer of the company may be the leadership that needs to endorse and support Syntex implementation. Leadership could also potentially be on a smaller scale, depending on the organization’s size, such as the IT administrator.  

These leaders are aware of one your organization’s primary goals – increased customer satisfaction. A large part of customer satisfaction relies on how well Contoso Electronics delivers on contracted goods and services. Executives at your company can powerfully speak to this goal and how Syntex supports less product delivery lead time and less time trying to make sense of complex document libraries.

### Project leads

The project lead is the person or team that manages the entire execution and launch of the new content understanding system. They will need to have a solid understanding of not only what the goal or aim of executing Syntex is but also what is involved to make that happen. Their function will be to ensure that all the other stakeholders are identified, and roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.  

A project lead will need to be someone familiar with project management and have an all-encompassing view of your organization’s structure. At Contoso Electronics, this could simply be a member of your IT or project management team who can see the project successfully launched and managed.  

### Knowledge admin

The knowledge admin is responsible for the creation and management of your organization’s specific content centers for document understanding models. Knowledge admins need to understand how your content centers should be structured (i.e., how many, for what departments, etc.) and who should have access to them and be capable of creating and adjusting existing models.  

This stakeholder could be a member of Contoso Electronics’ IT department or it could be someone who works more regularly with the content, such as a technical writer or an administrative assistant.

### Content managers/model owners

The content managers or model owners themselves are responsible for actuating what the project lead (or leads) have set out and established. They will be the ones creating the models within the content center or using AI Builder, so they will need to be experts at the model creation process, as well as understand the overall goals set out by the project leads. Model owners will also need to be responsible for identifying use cases for Syntex on an ongoing basis, so that Syntex can continue to be applied for continued optimization.  

As touched on earlier, model owners will need to be the ones that work with these models regularly. This could be the customer service representatives, salespeople, or it could be delegated to administrative assistants who understand internal and external customer needs but are also able to understand organizational processes and requirements.

### Champions

The members of your team who advocate for Syntex rollout are critical. The champions will drive other stakeholders forward and help ingrain content understanding processes into your organization, making them an accepted norm.  

Your Syntex champions will need to have a basic understanding of not only how the solution works, but also the aims and goals of applying it. This understanding will allow them to answer any questions or objections that may arise from other members of the organization when implementing. Any organizational change is often met with questioning, so being able to meet these questions with answers and a clear understanding can be crucial.  

At Contoso Electronics, all your stakeholders should ideally be champions. Executives, knowledge admins, and model owners are close enough to the initiative that they can actively endorse rollout. Aside from stakeholders, the salespeople and customer service representatives should be champions, as they are the ones seeing some of the most direct benefits from this more organized content system – time back with customers.

### Global admin

Specific tenant settings will be necessary within the content center and for AI Builder. Users will need to have an admin designate their level of access and what they have access to, so a single admin or user overseeing this will be important. The global admin should ideally be someone with an IT understanding since tenant-level settings require more backend work and an understanding of how to administer IT settings.  

The tenant administrator could be a particular member of the organization’s IT team who already handles software and solutions for the company. This team member or multiple team members will need to be comfortable with not only establishing these tenant-level settings but also updating them on a regular basis, as needed, including when new model owners and other admin are onboarded to your organization.

### Power Platform admin

The Power Platform admin will be another technical stakeholder. They are the most familiar with Power Platform and the use of Power Apps and applying AI Builder to the necessary document libraries.  

This stakeholder could potentially be the same as the tenant administrator, depending on the size and needs of your organization. They will most likely also be a member of your healthcare company’s IT department since they will need to have a more technical understanding of the data services environment and how to configure it for your organization.
