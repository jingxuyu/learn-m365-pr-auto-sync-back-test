This module showed you how to monitor the health of your Microsoft 365 deployment. For many companies, Microsoft 365 is their first major public cloud effort. One of the challenges these companies face is learning how the IT team monitors Microsoft 365. For many companies, their monitoring systems aren't configured to monitor services outside of their local area network. So as part of your organizationâ€™s transition to Microsoft 365, you must learn how to monitor it using Microsoft 365 tools. In doing so, you should tie monitoring and health information into your existing monitoring tools.

The Microsoft 365 Admin Center includes a Health page that provides information on the health of your online services. It also includes information about any impending maintenance tasks that Microsoft plans to conduct. In this module, you examined the monitoring features and functionality in Microsoft 365. You were also introduced to key concepts related to monitoring Microsoft 365.

You also learned how to create an incident response plan for times when incidents in service occur. Microsoft 365 is always changing and updating to give its customers the best service it can. At times, this type of dynamic environment can lead to incidents in the service, such as a short outage or a degradation in a valued service such as SharePoint or Skype for Business. When these incidents occur, it's the duty of the Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator to monitor these events and develop a plan.

For times when you need to contact Microsoft Support, you learned that it provides global technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support with every Microsoft 365 Enterprise, Business, Education, and Government subscription. Support is available both online through the Microsoft 365 portal and by telephone for both paid and trial subscriptions. This module provided instruction so that if you ever have to contact Microsoft, you'll know what responsibilities are yours and what responsibilities fall on Microsoft Support.
