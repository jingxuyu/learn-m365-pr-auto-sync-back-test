## Projects/Key Initiatives

**Projects**/**Key Initiatives** are a list of tasks or focused outputs that underpin the Key Results. In Viva Goals these tasks are captured using **Projects.**

There are 2 types of **Projects**:

- **Native Projects** - These are Projects whose task list is created and managed directly in Viva Goals.

- **Integrated Projects** - These are Projects whose progress is managed via an integration with an outside project management tool.

Projects can either created directly underneath the Key Result they're supporting or as a standalone effort. To add a **Project** as a standalone effort, select the **Projects** tab for the entity for which the Project is being created.
