Which service that's bundled with Windows provides this functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remote Assistance"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Remote Assistance is a bundled service with Windows. It enables a technician to take control of a computer to troubleshoot and perform maintenance tasks without having to physically travel to the problematic machine. This enables the technician to resolve problems without leaving their home or office. The end user must be there to authorize this, and the user can end the session at any time. This technology is generally used only to troubleshoot remote computers and is not used for telecommuting or accessing files or folders."

  - content: "Contoso recently purchased a new PC for use by its Sales team. Each Sales team member will be able to access the PC remotely from their laptops.

    choices:
    - content: "Remote connections must be allowed for the local Authenticated Users group"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the user who joined the PC to Azure AD is the only one who is going to connect remotely, no additional configuration is needed. However, to allow additional users to connect to the PC, you must allow remote connections for the local Authenticated Users group."
    - content: "Remote Assistance connections must be enabled for the PC"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. No additional configuration is needed if the user who joined the PC to Azure AD is the only one who's going to remotely connect to it. Since the entire Sales team will be connecting to it, additional configuration is needed. Try again."
  - content: "As the Desktop Administrator for World Wide Importers, you're interested in a Windows 10 or later tool that will enable you to manage the company's servers. You also want to use a subset of the Server Manager features to manage Windows client PCs. For example, you want to display resources and resource utilization, manage certificates and devices, configure local users and groups, and edit the registry. Which tool in Windows 10 or later provides this combination of server and client management functionality?"
    choices:
    - content: "Remote Desktop Services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Remote Desktop Services (RDS), formerly Terminal Services, provide users with access to a full remote desktop experience. In this scenario, users securely connect to a remote session via their local Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client. After they authenticate, users are presented with a full desktop just as if they were signed in locally. Try again."
    - content: "Windows Remote Management service"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. WinRM is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Management protocol that provides a common way for hardware and operating systems from different vendors to interact, access, and exchange management information across an IT infrastructure. Try again."
    - content: "Windows Admin Center"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Windows Admin Center is a locally deployed, browser-based management tool that lets you manage Windows clients and servers remotely over HTTPS.

  - content: "Tom is an IT Support Professional for Fabrikam. One of the users that Tom supports isn't able to make a remote desktop connection to a Windows 10 computer. The user keeps receiving an Access Denied error. Tom must confirm whether the user's account has permissions to make a remote desktop connection.

    - content: "Remote Desktop Users"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. As a member of the Remote Desktop Users group, users will have the appropriate permissions to connect. While the Administrators group also provides these permissions, it provides much more access than is required to meet the request. As such, Remote Desktop Users is a better choice than Administrators."
    - content: "Administrators"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this action provides permissions, it provides much more access than is required to meet the request. This option isn't the best choice. Try again."
