SharePoint Online provides anti-malware protection for files uploaded and saved to document libraries. This protection is provided by the Microsoft anti-malware engine that's also integrated into Exchange. This anti-malware service runs on all SharePoint Online web sites.

The service offers multi-layered malware protection that’s designed to catch all known malware traveling inbound to or outbound from an organization. The following options help provide anti-malware protection:

 -  **Layered defenses against malware.** Multiple anti-malware scan engines help protect against both known and unknown threats. These engines include powerful heuristic detection to provide protection even during the early stages of a malware outbreak. This multi-engine approach has been shown to provide more protection than using just one anti-malware engine.
 -  **Real-time threat response.** During some outbreaks, the anti-malware team may have enough information about a virus or other form of malware to write sophisticated policy rules that detect the threat even before a definition is available from any of the engines used by the service. These rules are published to the global network every two hours. This design provides an organization with an extra layer of protection against attacks.
 -  **Fast anti-malware definition deployment.** Microsoft's anti-malware team maintains close relationships with partners who develop anti-malware engines. As a result, the service can receive and integrate malware definitions and patches before they're publicly released. Microsoft’s connection with these partners often allows it to develop its own remedies as well. The service checks for updated definitions for all anti-malware engines every hour.
