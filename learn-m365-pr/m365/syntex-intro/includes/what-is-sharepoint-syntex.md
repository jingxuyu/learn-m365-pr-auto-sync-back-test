SharePoint Syntex is a Microsoft 365 service that allows your organization to easily do three main things:

- Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to amplify human experiences
- Automate content processing
- Transform content into tangible knowledge

With SharePoint Syntex, you use AI and machine learning to automatically and thoughtfully organize and classify documents in your SharePoint library. Being able to work more effectively with your content and the data within it creates stronger business processes. If your team can label and categorize your content more accurately, you can use this information to implement better business processes. Greater organization of your data creates better organization of your business.  

How this is achieved can be broken into three parts: document understanding, form processing, and content compliance.

### Document understanding

The first part of SharePoint Syntex is document understanding. Using AI, you can classify and extract the information that you pre-define in your content so that metadata is automatically applied, appearing as columns in your SharePoint document library. Document understanding allows for quicker and more efficient understanding of the information within your content.  

At Contoso Electronics, automated and AI-driven document understanding could be valuable for documents like inquiries, which often have less uniformity and structure, but still need to be processed and understood in a timely manner.

### Form processing

Forms processing is the “assembly-line” part of SharePoint Syntex. This is where AI models take in _structured_ and _semi-structured_ documents to capture, ingest, and categorize the content so that business processes can be streamlined.

At Contoso, form processing would be how you handle items such as sales contracts. These contracts have specific information and concrete data that is kept within a uniform structure. Information from these contracts needs to be extracted so that your colleagues have exactly what they need to process the contracts.

### Content compliance

Understanding your content allows for better organization. Organization increases management and governance options for all your data. When content is properly tagged and labeled, you will have better control over your data and be able to follow regulations more easily. Being able to correctly process data is key to ensuring that it is secure and accurate.  

Contoso receives and handles sensitive client information. Being able to easily locate and dispose of this data when appropriate sets the company and its clients up for compliance and data governance success.
