    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Your team wants to classify and extract information from a large set of letters recently added to a SharePoint document library and would also like to pull metadata from these letters for use in the document library. Which part of SharePoint Syntex would this capability fall under?"
      choices:
      - content: "Document understanding"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Document understanding uses no-code AI models to classify and identify documents so that metadata can be extracted and used within SharePoint document libraries."
      - content: "Form processing"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Form processing applies to capturing, ingesting, and categorizing structured documents, such as invoices and applications, for more streamlined content processes."
      - content: "Content compliance"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Content compliance is focused on security and governance, which is a result of the proper understanding, processing, and retention of sensitive data and information."
        
    - content: "The legal department of your organization wants to ensure that a specific set of documents is kept in the SharePoint document library for the next year. What would need to be applied to the document library to ensure this happens?"
      choices:
      - content: "Explanation"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. An explanation accompanies your classifier model and the extractor so that the models know what information to use for classification or what needs to be extracted. Explanations do not directly ensure that a document will be kept or removed."
      - content: "Retention labels"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Retention labels are created in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center but can be added to a document understanding model so that documents within your SharePoint document library are either retained or removed for a designated period of time."
      - content: "Classifier"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A classifier model may include retention labels but the model itself will not have retention set up unless the labels are added."

    - content: "Your organization’s Accounting team wants to create a new form processing model for processing employee timesheets. The SharePoint document library has already been enabled to create form processing models. Where should they go to create the form processing model?"
      choices:
      - content: "Content center"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A content center is where they should go to create a document understanding model, not a form processing model."
      - content: "The timesheets document library"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Since a SharePoint admin has already enabled form processing for the SharePoint document library, the team can select the AI Builder option on the Automate menu in the SharePoint document library where the timesheets will be added."
      - content: "Microsoft 365 admin center"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. The admin center is where SharePoint admin can enable form processing for individual document libraries but would not be where the team should go to create the form processing models."

    - content: "A member of your organization’s Operations team shares that they have been receiving many invoices from several suppliers each week and they are not sure how to manage these documents in the SharePoint document library so they can be passed along to the appropriate department. Which feature of SharePoint Syntex would be the ideal solution to address this need?"
      choices:
      - content: "Form processing model"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Since an invoice is a structured document, a form processing model would be ideal for capturing and categorizing information from these documents."
      - content: "Document understanding model"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A document understanding model would not work here, considering that document understanding models are intended for unstructured pieces of content, such as letters or contracts."
      - content: "Classifier"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A classifier is a type of document understanding model, intended for use on unstructured documents that need to be examined and classified based on information defined in the model."
