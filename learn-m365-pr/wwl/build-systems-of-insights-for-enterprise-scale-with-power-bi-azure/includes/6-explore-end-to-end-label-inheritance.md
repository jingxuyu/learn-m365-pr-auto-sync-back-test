With end-to-end label inheritance, reports and dashboards created in the Power BI service automatically inherit the sensitivity label applied on the parent dataset or report. For example, a new report created on top of a dataset that has a "Highly Confidential" sensitivity label will automatically receive the "Highly Confidential" label as well.  In the event that data classification changes, the Power BI report or dashboard will reflect the change as well.
