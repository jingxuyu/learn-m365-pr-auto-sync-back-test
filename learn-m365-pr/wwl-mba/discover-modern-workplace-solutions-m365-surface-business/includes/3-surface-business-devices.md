Organizations today are trying to ensure their employees are empowered to do their best work, which means saving them time and improving their overall satisfaction-this leads to better retention, and more productivity.

Equipping employees with best-in-class software is a necessary first step, but the device they are working on is equally as critical. Employees need powerful, fast, and secure hardware that can fit the way they work, whether they are a nurse at a patient's bedside, a salesperson meeting with a client, or flight attendant 30,000 feet in the air.

Which is why we have our Surface for Business family of devices. The best possible way to experience Microsoft 365 is on the Surface for Business family of devices, with software that runs on the hardware it was built for.

Our collection of hardware devices includes personal computers, interactive whiteboards, headphones, tablets, and more. According to a commissioned Total Economic Impact&trade; study from Forrester Consulting, three out of four people agree that Microsoft 365-powered Surface devices help improve employee satisfaction and retention. The remarkable synergy between the hardware of Surface for Business and the software of Microsoft 365 can save mobile workers more time when compared with other devices.

Microsoft 365 software and Surface for Business devices together provide the optimal experience for any employee, from IT, to marketing and sales, to finance, engineering, **firstline workers**, and more.

Firstline workers include nurses, retail workers, customer service agents, flight attendants, and others.

Microsoft 365 is built for all; you won't need different tools for different employees. The possibilities and resources that Microsoft 365 and Surface offer together can empower your entire workforce.

Now that we've explored the benefits of Microsoft 365 with Surface for Business devices for all employees, let's see how Microsoft 365 can empower everyone to achieve more, even those individuals with accessibility needs.
