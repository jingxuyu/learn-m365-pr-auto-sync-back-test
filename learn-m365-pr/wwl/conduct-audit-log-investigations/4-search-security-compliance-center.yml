  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, Allan Deyoung just finished running an audit log search. Allan's goal was to retrieve all the Exchange activity for the past 90 days. For this search, Allan used all the default values for each search criteria. Allan did, however, enter several keywords for the search that mapped to problematic activities that have been ongoing at Northwind Traders for the past year. When inspecting the search results, Allan noticed that there was no activity for the past few months. Which of the following items would have resulted in this missing activity from the search results?"
    choices:
    - content: "Allan didn't select the \"Show results for all activities\" option when configuring the search criteria"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option displays results for all activities completed by the selected user or group of users. Try again."
    - content: "The Start and End date criteria defaulted to the last seven days"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The last seven days are selected by default. Allan used all the default values for each search criteria, so the search only looked at activities for the past seven days."
    - content: "There were no activities over the past 90 days that mapped to the keywords Allan entered"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While plausible, this item isn't the cause as to why activities were missing from the search results. The keywords were for activities that had been happening for the past year, so theoretically, there should have been activities that mapped to the keywords. There was another reason that invalidated this answer. Try again."
