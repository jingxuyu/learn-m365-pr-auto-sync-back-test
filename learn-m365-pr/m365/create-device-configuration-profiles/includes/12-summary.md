Before you enroll devices to be managed by Microsoft Endpoint Manager and used by members of your organization, you should create the device configuration profiles, the device compliance policies, and the conditional access policies needed by your organization. Device configuration profiles are groups of settings that enable or disable different device capabilities. These capabilities are used to configure the devices used in your organization so users and devices can access the right resources and data, safely and securely. Device configuration profiles help users become productive quickly. 

In this module, you've learned about device configuration profiles so that you can apply these configuration profiles when you enroll your organization's devices into Microsoft Intune. The goals of this module included the following:

- Learn about device configuration concepts
- Understand basic, standard, and complex device configuration profiles
- Create and assign a new device configuration profile
- View the device configuration profiles
