The security landscape is continuously evolving and developing to meet the ever-growing challenges made of it by its users and those who would seek to take advantage of weaknesses. Any security system is only as good as the weakest link in the chain.

Providing access to your resources and data is an essential requirement for all organizations. Microsoft 365 lets you improve the users’ sign-in experience while maintaining security, by providing tools and services like Windows Hello, Multi-factor authentication, and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
