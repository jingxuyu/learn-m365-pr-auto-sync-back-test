As we go through the Azure Resource Manager template used to provision Windows Virtual Desktop host pools, we’ll review your options for:  
- Creating pooled or personal virtual machines 
- Choosing images, including the Windows images available in the Azure gallery  
- Using domain-joined user accounts versus service identities. 

By default the Windows Virtual Desktop host pool configures a remote desktop for specified user accounts. Users can also choose apps from app groups. We’ll show you how to modify the apps and desktop experiences available to users.
