        explanation: "A direct peering relationship with the Microsoft Global network doesn't constitute a hairpin."
      - content: "Your routers are configured to send Microsoft 365 traffic directly."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "When routers are configured to send traffic directly to Microsoft 365, without going through an intermediate location, it doesn't constitute a hairpin."
  #QUESTION 2
  - content: "Which of the following tools could you use to find out your distance from the network egress location?"
    choices:
      - content: "Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Skype for Business Network Assessment Tool doesn't show your distance from the network egress location."
      - content: "Network Planner for Microsoft Teams"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "The Network Planner for Microsoft Teams doesn't show the distance from the network egress location."

    choices:
      - content: "Ensure your network perimeter is secured against attack."

      - content: "Microsoft Azure Active Directory conditional access."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "By combining data about, for example, users, devices and locations, you determine whether the request should be granted, denied, or controlled with more information, such as two-factor authentication."
      - content: "User passwords that require changing every three months."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A single compromised password could risk an attacker gaining access to all of your network."

  - content: "Which of the following network configurations will have a negative impact on the performance of Teams meetings?"
    choices:
      - content: "Microsoft Teams traffic is directed through a VPN."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "For best performance, Teams traffic shouldn't be directed through a VPN."
      - content: "Microsoft Teams traffic isn't directed through a VPN."
