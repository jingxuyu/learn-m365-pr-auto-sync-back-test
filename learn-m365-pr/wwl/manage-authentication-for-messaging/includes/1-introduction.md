Security is a great concern for every organization. In today’s world, many employees are mobile and work from multiple locations and multiple devices. This remote workplace structure makes it even more important that users sign in and access data and resources in a secure manner.

As a Messaging administrator, you must ensure that user accounts are well protected and secure. Deploying multiple security features shouldn't introduce unnecessary complexity in your users’ everyday work that can result in lower business productivity and new security risks.

This module begins by examining password policy options that messaging administrators can set for users in their organization. Setting password policies is one of the key responsibilities for administrators in a Microsoft 365 organization.

A common scenario in many organizations involves users who occasionally forget their passwords and then send a request to administrators for password reset. This module explores how Microsoft 365 addresses this issue by enabling Messaging admins to configure self-service password reset (SSPR). SSPR enables users to reset their own passwords.

The module then examines multifactor authentication, which is an optional password security feature in Microsoft 365. Multifactor authentication is a method of authentication that requires the use of more than one verification method. This design adds a second layer of security to user sign-ins and transactions.

The module concludes by exploring various best practices that Messaging administrators should consider when planning password management policies.
