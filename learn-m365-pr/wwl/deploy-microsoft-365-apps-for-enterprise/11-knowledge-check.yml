Which of the following issues is a typical obstacle that prevents users from successfully deploying Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise?"
    choices:
    - content: "The user is running Windows Vista"
      isCorrect: false

  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, which has replaced its legacy Office apps with the Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise productivity suite. Tailspin has developed a large number of macros and add-ins to customize its Office apps to improve user productivity. As such, it's important that all new Office releases be thoroughly tested for compatibility before they're deployed throughout the company. In addition, Tailspin has selected devices that require extensive testing before rolling out new Office features to ensure they comply with regulatory and governmental requirements. Given Tailspin's extensive testing requirements, which of the following update channels should it use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Current Channel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Current Channel provides users with the newest Office features as soon as they're ready. Current Channel usually receives new features at least once a month, but there's no set schedule for when those updates are released. This schedule won't provide Tailspin with adequate testing time between releases."
    - content: "Monthly Enterprise Channel"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While the Monthly Enterprise Channel supports monthly testing, it won't provide enough time to complete Tailspin's extensive testing requirements in between releases."
