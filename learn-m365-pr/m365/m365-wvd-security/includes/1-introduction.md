Learn about the Microsoft security capabilities that help keep your applications and data secure in your Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop deployment.

Suppose you work for Contoso, Ltd., a growing financial services company that's based in London and has a branch office in New York. The company uses Microsoft 365 and Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

The IT director has asked you to evaluate the risks and benefits to using Azure Virtual Desktop to support remote workers. The key aspects of the evaluation will be functionality, scalability, security, and the cost of Azure Virtual Desktop.

In this module, you'll learn how to access Azure Virtual Desktop from the Azure portal. You'll also be introduced to the shared responsibility model of a secure Azure Virtual Desktop environment.

After you complete this module, you'll be able to explain the requirements and architecture for an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment and assess its security.
