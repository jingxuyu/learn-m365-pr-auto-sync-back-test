It’s clear that companies with data-driven cultures move faster, make better decisions, and serve their customers better. Research by NewVantage partners found that nearly 80% of executives at Fortune 1000 and other industry-leading companies are concerned about threats from more agile, data-first companies – not just Amazon and Google, but nimble startups founded on a data-driven culture. That’s why nearly all businesses are making some type of investment in advanced analytics capabilities.

Unfortunately, only 1 in 3 companies feel they’ve made a shift to a data-driven culture. The most difficult part is addressing people challenges like organizational alignment and cultural resistance. Data needs to be available to employees wherever they already get work done, with as little manual data curation required as possible. Insights also need to be made central to teamwork – when teams work off a single source of truth that updates in real-time, they can build consensus faster.

Microsoft 365 offers  AI-powered tools and data visualization capabilities to help people at every level of the business make informed, data-driven decisions faster. You can unlock new insights and communicate them visually or analyze information and gain new perspectives to fuel transformation – whether through new features in Excel or Power BI or immersive experiences like Mixed Reality.
Some of these features include: Data Types, Power BI, Excel, MyAnalytics, Workplace Analytics

## Using Power BI and Excel to empower employees to make data-driven decisions 

### Create a single source of truth

The starting point for building a data-driven culture is establishing a single source of truth. We make this easy with Power BI, a modern BI cloud service that connects to all of your data, wherever it lives, in the cloud or on premises, Microsoft or non-Microsoft. It delivers insights to you in any way, anywhere, from mobile to web, as well as embedded in apps, both first party and third party. Office 365 further extends this with versions that allow you to quickly look at differences, auditing and roll back, allowing you to confidently manage the single version of truth.

### Analyze & visualize data

The next step is to make it easy to analyze and explore data, then share it out seamlessly. Here we deliver the industry leading analyst tool with Excel, which allows you to ask questions at the pace of your business transformation, in a tool you use daily. Sometimes it’s easier for us to spot trends and outliers when data is presented visually. Power BI makes visualization simple and easy. Sometimes we want both. Power BI integrates natively with Excel, so users can easily dive deeper into visualizations from Excel and vice-versa. Together with Visio, you can visualize complex process flows directly into Power BI.

### Run your business in real time with live dashboards

All of the visualizations and dashboards you create in Power BI, Excel, and Visio can be programmed to update in real-time, so that you can react to opportunities and threats as soon as they appear.

### Put insights at the center of teamwork

Lastly, with the growing importance of teamwork in the modern workplace it’s critical that teams can collaborate on data in real-time. Power BI and Excel both integrate natively with Teams and Office 365, making it easier to create consensus based on data.
