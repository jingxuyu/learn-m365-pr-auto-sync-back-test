This module examined how to plan for and configure network settings for Microsoft Teams. Before deploying Microsoft Teams in a productive environment, administrators need to ensure that the existing network infrastructure of an organization will meet the requirements needed for collaboration and communication.

In this module, you learned how to make a detailed review of the current infrastructure within your organization, check the existing network capabilities, set up ports and protocols, and configure reporting labels. You'll also learn how to test the network environments capabilities and use Quality of Service for network optimization.

This module explored the tools available in Microsoft 365 for testing network bandwidth and performance. You began by reviewing Network Planner, which helps determine and organize network requirements for connecting Microsoft Teams users across the whole organization. After providing network details and Teams usage, the Network Planner calculates the network requirements for deploying Teams and cloud voice across the organizationâ€™s physical locations.

You then examined how Quality of Service in Microsoft Teams allows real-time network traffic that's sensitive to network delays (for example, voice or video streams) to "cut in line" in front of traffic that's less sensitive (like downloading a new app, where an extra second to download isn't a large deal). QoS provides a way to more effectively manage the resources you have instead of adding bandwidth. 

This module then examined Call analytics, which shows call and meeting quality for individual users in Teams. Location-enhanced Call Analytics reports contain the location names instead of just an IP subnet, making the reports easier to understand and use for remediating any potential issues.

You then were introduced to Call Quality Dashboard (CQD). CQD provides a network-wide view of call quality across an organization. Location-enhanced CQD reports help the network engineer determine if the problem is a site-related issue. For example, you can include different building locations or endpoint-specific views such as wired or Wi-Fi connected devices. The data can be assessed to determine if the problem is isolated to a single user or affects a larger segment of users.

The module concluded with an examination of the Microsoft 365 connectivity test. The Microsoft 365 connectivity test is a proof of concept (POC) network assessment tool that runs basic connectivity tests against your Microsoft 365 tenant and makes specific network design recommendations for optimal Microsoft 365 performance. The tool is run locally and gathers more data for deeper insights. The tool can help identify the root cause of the problem. The reports include recommended network performance improvement activities.
