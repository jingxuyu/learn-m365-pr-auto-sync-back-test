quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following items describes a feature of Office 365 Message Encryption (OME)?"
    choices:
    - content: "OME requires the client sending the message to encrypt the email message using a public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. S/MIME requires the client sending the message to encrypt the email message using a public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate. OME doesn't have this requirement. Try again."
    - content: "The PKI certificate must be installed or available on the client computer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item is a feature of S/MIME. In contrast to S/MIME, OME uses built-in certificates to encrypt messages in the OME service during the transport of the message. Try again."
    - content: "With OME, an organization can send and receive encrypted email messages between people inside and outside the organization"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. With Office 365 Message Encryption, your organization can send and receive encrypted email messages between people inside and outside your organization. Office 365 Message Encryption works with Outlook.com, Yahoo!, Gmail, and other email services. Email message encryption helps ensure that only intended recipients can view message content."
