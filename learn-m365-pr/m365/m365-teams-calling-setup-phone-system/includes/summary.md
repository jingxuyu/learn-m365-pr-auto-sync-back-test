You've explored how you can enable your users to place and receive calls through Microsoft Teams, by taking advantage of Phone System for Microsoft Teams across your organization. You've learned how to set up Phone System and configure some of its key capabilities to help your organization to get the best out of Microsoft Teams.

Without Phone System for Microsoft Teams, your users wouldn't be able to place, or receive calls and perform other tasks directly from their Microsoft Teams client, and collaboration might have been impacted. Instead, through Phone System, all of your organization's users can perform these actions from Microsoft Teams and collaborate easier.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the 10-step setup process for Phone System.
- Set up key Phone System capabilities.
- Set up emergency calling.
