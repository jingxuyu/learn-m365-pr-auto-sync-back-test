quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson has created an eDiscovery case in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to address a legal issue facing the company. What should Holly do to preserve any content that's relevant to the case?"
    choices:
    - content: "Place the custodian data on hold"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Custodian data can be placed on hold. Doing so preserves data that may be relevant to the case during the investigation."
    - content: "Index custodian data by using the process known as Advanced indexing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This process enables custodial content such as images, unsupported file types, and other potentially unindexed content to be fully searchable when you run searches to collect data for the case."
    - content: "Create searches to search the in-place custodial and non-custodial data sources in Microsoft 365 for content relevant to the case"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Holly will eventually create searches to search for content relevant to the case, this action isn't what Holly should do to preserve the relevant content in the first place."
