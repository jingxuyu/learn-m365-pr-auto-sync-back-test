Microsoft 365 empowers organizations with the following capabilities: 

|Capability|Description|

Some Microsoft 365 components, like Office and Windows, are delivered using the **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** model. SaaS is software thatâ€™s centrally hosted and managed by a **cloud service provider (CSP)** for customers. In general, CSPs provide one version of an app for all customers and license it through a monthly or annual subscription.
