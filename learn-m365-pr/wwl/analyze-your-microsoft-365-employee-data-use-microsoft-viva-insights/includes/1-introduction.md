This module explores Microsoft Viva Insights (formerly Workplace Analytics), which provides powerful organizational analytics solutions. Microsoft Viva Insights taps into Microsoft 365 email and calendar metadata, including to/from data, subject lines, and timestamps. Its goal is to show how an organization collaborates and spends time. It turns this digital exhaust—the data that comes naturally from our everyday work—into a set of behavioral metrics that can be used to understand what’s going on in an organization.

Successful organizations track their business outcomes. But how do they measure the day-to-day actions that create those outcomes? Collaboration is a key component of knowledge worker success. Employees work through networks, interacting with coworkers and leaders. With Microsoft 365 data, you can measure these interactions. Microsoft 365 captures signals from meetings, email, Teams calls, and messaging activities. It's the largest existing dataset of how people spend time at work, passively generated from everyday work activities.

Microsoft Viva Insights provides visibility into:

 -  How people invest their time through different types of activities.
 -  How they share information with other individuals in their team and beyond.
 -  How teams interact with other teams, geographies, lines of business, and external contacts.

This understanding can help organizations and their employees develop stronger work habits and team norms and do their jobs more effectively. But to turn the data into insights, raw signals need to be converted into useful information. In this module, you'll learn how Microsoft Viva Insights;

 -  Translates interactions into aggregate measures of time and relationships.
 -  Merges collaboration information with contextual data about employee and customer organizations, roles, geographies, and outcomes.
 -  Provides options and controls to protect individual privacy while getting insight from the data.

This module examines how Microsoft Viva Insights turns data into useful insights by providing:

 -  Measures
 -  Context
