    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "What is the Defender's Dilemma?"
      choices:
      - content: "Above all, assume compromise."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "When working in the cybersecurity space security administrators should have the mindset that if something seems off or suspicious, assume compromise."
      - content: "Your identities are always under attack."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "While you should always assume your identities are under threat of attack, this is not the Defender’s Dilemma."
      - content: "As the attacker, you have to be right every time, everywhere, forever. As the defender, I just have to be right once."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "This is the opposite of the Defender’s Dilemma. Attackers can repeatedly attack organizations while defenders are constantly trying to identify and prevent attempted breaches."
      - content: "•	As the defender, you have to be right every time, everywhere, forever. As the attacker, I just have to be right once."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The Defender’s Dilemma focuses on with low cost of attack these attempts can repeatedly be carried out to breach your environment. By creating a high attacker cost, in partnership with thwarting attacks, failed breaches now become detrimental to attackers."
    - content: "Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection allows defenders to run simulated attacks. Which of the below is not a simulated attack offered by Office 365 ATP?"
      choices:
      - content: "Password-spray attack"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Office 365 ATP allows a password-spray simulated attack in which a hacker leverages multiple sets of credentials stolen through phishing attempts to try to breach your organization."
      - content: "Safe attachment phishing"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. While Office 365 ATP does proactively monitor and protect your organization from malicious attachments and URLs, safe attachment phishing is not an offered O365 ATP simulation."
      - content: "Brute-force password attack"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Office 365 ATP allows a simulated brute-force password attack in which an attacker would use all possible combinations to figure out the password to an organizational resource."
      - content: "Display name spear-phishing attack"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Office 365 ATP allows a simulated brute-force password attack in which an attacker would use all possible combinations to figure out the password to an organizational resource."
    - content: "Which of the following security principles are not part of the Microsoft Security Strategy Principles?"
      choices:
      - content: "Your identities are always under attack."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "As a security administrator you should always assume your identities are under threat of attack as identity or credential theft is one of the most common attacks seen."
      - content: "Successful defense requires you to dramatically increase attacker cost."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A low cost of attack enables attackers to repeatedly make attempts on breaching your organization. To prevent threats and attacks you must increase the cost of attack by potential attackers through defense systems and frameworks."
      - content: "Protect, Identify, Respond"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. While identify may be synonymous with Detect, the security principle focuses on protect against future threats, detect pending or existing threats when available, and respond to the threats eliminating the attack."
      - content: "Above all, assume compromise."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "When working in the cybersecurity space security administrators should have the mindset that if something seems off or suspicious, assume compromise."
