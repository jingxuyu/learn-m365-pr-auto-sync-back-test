Planning to deploy a Microsoft 365 tenant is a multi-step process. Once you've planned for your Microsoft 365 on-premises infrastructure, you should then plan your identity and authentication solution, which was the focus of this module. We began by examining the key areas that organizations must plan for to either move their Microsoft 365 service completely to the cloud or to hybridize their environment. We then reviewed a host of identity-related issues that require planning, including:

 *  Directory synchronization
 *  Azure AD Connect
 *  Azure AD Connect pass through
 *  AD FS deployments
 *  Active Directory Federation Services in Microsoft Azure
 *  Azure Active Directory Single Sign-On

Microsoft 365 uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which is a cloud-based user identity and authentication service that's included with your Microsoft 365 subscription. Azure AD manages identities and authentication for Microsoft 365. This module examined the importance of correctly configuring your identity infrastructure and managing Microsoft 365 user access and permissions for your organization.

Now that you've completed this module, you should have a greater understanding of what's required for planning your Microsoft 365 identity and authentication solution.
