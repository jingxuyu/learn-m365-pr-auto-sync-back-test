In this module, you’ll see how the cloud-only and hybrid deployments require different approaches and how an organization approaches migrating systems with older versions of Office, Windows, and Office Server to Microsoft 365.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you will learn:
- The considerations to keep in mind when selecting a cloud service.
- Terminology associated with adopting a cloud service.
- The difference between cloud-only and hybrid migration models and how to choose between them.
- When an organization might want to move systems with older operating systems and Microsoft Office directly to Microsoft 365 instead of upgrading legacy software.

## Pre-requisites
- None

*Cloud-only* describes a situation in which the service models you want to use (software as a service [SaaS], platform as a service [PaaS], or infrastructure as a service [IaaS]) are run strictly in the cloud with no connection to existing on-premises-based systems. One of the advantages of using the cloud-only model is that you don’t have to worry about the infrastructure that the services run on. All the backend functionality is invisible to your users and your IT department.

For smaller companies like startups or non-profits that don’t have in-house IT resources or capital to buy and maintain their own infrastructure, the cloud-only model, with its managed infrastructure, can be a good choice - you don't have to buy or manage the infrastructure because the cloud service provider (CSP) takes care of that. Note, however, that the cloud-only model can limit how much you can tailor your services, because your users and IT staff can't customize the SaaS and PaaS-based services running in the cloud.

If you need to be able to customize your services and infrastructure, you may need a hybrid model instead.
