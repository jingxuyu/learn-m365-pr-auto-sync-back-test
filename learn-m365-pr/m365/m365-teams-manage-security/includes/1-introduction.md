Microsoft Teams is designed with security as a priority and comes with a number of tools to help administrators manage security.

Suppose you're the lead administrator for a software development company that specializes in customer relationship management (CRM) software. You're planning to roll out Microsoft Teams and use it throughout your company for conferencing, project management, chats, and telephony. Your management has identified security as a critical issue and made you responsible for it during and after the Teams deployment. You want to ensure that the new Teams functionality can't be used in insecure ways by users.

In this module, you'll learn about the security model Microsoft used when they built Teams, how it  complies with data protection regulations in your territory, and how Teams protects your information from accidental and deliberate compromise.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

-	Describe the Microsoft Teams security model.
-	Explain how to manage security and compliance in Teams.
