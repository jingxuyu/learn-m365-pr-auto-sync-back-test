**Objectives** and **Key Results** (OKRs) are a goal-setting framework that drives focus, visibility, and alignment, and Viva Goals is the software that lets you easily and effectively maintain and access them across your organization.

You can easily create OKRs for any time period that is relevant for your organization and view how these Objectives and Key Results align.

These can be updated and tracked on a regular basis by users in the system, by utilizing an integrated collaboration platform, or using an integration with an outside data source.

Finally, you can close and score your OKRs for the current time period and capture any reflections that can be used when writing your next set of OKRs.

The four main actions that you will perform in the system are known as the **4Cs**.

- **Cascade** - How OKRs align within Viva Goals
- **Create** - How to enter OKRs into the software
- **Check-in** - How to track the progress of your OKRs
- **Close** - How to score your OKRs
