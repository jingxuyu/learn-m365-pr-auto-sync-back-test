An organization's Outlook users can IRM-protect messages with the AD RMS rights policy templates available to them. This process uses the IRM functionality in Outlook rather than Exchange. However, Exchange can be used to access messages, and users can take actions (such as applying transport rules) to enforce their organization's messaging policy.

When an organization enables IRM in Outlook on the web, users can IRM-protect messages they send, and view IRM-protected messages they receive.

Mobile devices like Windows Phone, iOS, and Android can view and create IRM-protected messages with the Outlook app. To do so, users must connect their supported devices to a computer and activate them for IRM.

An organization can enable IRM in Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync to allow users of Exchange ActiveSync devices to view, reply to, forward, and create IRM-protected messages.

An organization can create Outlook Protection Rules to automatically IRM-protect messages in Outlook.

Outlook Protection Rules are deployed automatically to Outlook clients. IRM-protection is then applied by Outlook when the user composes a message.
