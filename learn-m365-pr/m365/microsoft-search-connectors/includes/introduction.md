Access to data and information is a key factor that impacts productivity in most modern organizations. However, enterprise data is often siloed or distributed across various sources—like cloud databases, intranet sites, or on-premises systems. With Microsoft Search, your organization can use Graph and federated search connectors to bring these sources into your search experience.

**Scenario:** A large advertising firm has used Salesforce as a CRM tool for many years. The firm’s leadership is looking to improve how existing client information is accessed internally.
