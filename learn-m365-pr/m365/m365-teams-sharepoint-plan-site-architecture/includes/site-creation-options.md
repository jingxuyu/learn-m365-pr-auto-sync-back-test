Architecturally, team sites have no relationship to each other. Each has its own association to an Office 365 Group or team and its own set of permissions to manage users. Association between related team sites can be created using hub sites, which we’ll cover soon.

There are two primary options for creating team sites:

- IT-managed
- Self-service

## IT-created sites

In an IT-managed site creation model, you create a site request process through your help desk and requests are evaluated by a SharePoint administrator. The SharePoint administrator then creates the approved sites by using the SharePoint admin center, and then gives the appropriate users access to the site. This process allows for IT oversight and governance but can be very time consuming, particularly in a large organization. Since many governance features can be automated and monitored by using the governance services in Microsoft 365, we recommend the self-service site creation model.

## Self-service sites

In a self-service site creation model, users can create sites, Office 365 Groups, and teams whenever they need to. The user who creates the site becomes a site owner (and an owner in the associated Office 365 Group or team). The owner can then invite others to the site and manage site membership over time.

IT can implement a site expiration policy to assure that unused sites don’t accumulate over time. Site owners are notified after a period of site inactivity that the site is set to expire, and they have the option to renew. IT can monitor user-created sites in the SharePoint admin center and remains in control of settings such as device management and guest sharing.
