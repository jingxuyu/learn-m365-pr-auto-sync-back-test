Discovery is the first step in planning your journey to Teams. Environmental discovery allows you to evaluate all aspects of your IT infrastructure, networking, and operations to ensure your organization is ready to implement Teams. A detailed discovery of your environment helps you better understand its current state and reveals any difficulties or possible blockers to the execution of your Teams rollout.

Environmental discovery includes a network readiness assessment to ensure your network can support the upgrade. All matters related to your existing collaboration infrastructure and Microsoft 365 tenant, networking, endpoints, operations, and adoption and readiness are included as part of the environmental discovery questionnaire.

The [discovery questionnaire](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/upgrade-plan-journey-evaluate-environment) covers the following information:

- Microsoft 365 tenant details
- Existing collaboration platform summary
- Collaboration platform deployment details
- Networking and access to Microsoft 365 services
- Endpoints
- Operations
- Adoption and readiness
