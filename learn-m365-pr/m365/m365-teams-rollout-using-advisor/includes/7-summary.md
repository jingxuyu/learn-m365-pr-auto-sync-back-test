Suppose you're a project manager rolling out Microsoft Teams to your company. You've seen how Advisor for Teams can act as an intelligent project manager for Teams deployment projects.

Advisor for Teams helps you plan for, and deploy Microsoft Teams. Advisor for Teams creates a Deployment team to manage your deployment. It also creates a Planner and adds tasks to it for specific roles in your team. By harnessing the team, you also encourage ambassadors who will help increase adoption efforts.

Imagine trying to roll out Teams in any organization without this help. Would you have thought of all the steps required? Would you have considered all the roles you needed in your team? How would you have tracked the progress of the project?

By using Advisor for Teams to manage a Teams deployment, you'll be more confident about the success of the project.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe how Advisor for Teams helps you to deploy Teams in your organization and supports adoption.
- Describe the workloads that Advisor for Teams supports.
- Demonstrate how to run an assessment of your environment to identify the deployment tasks you must complete.
- Explain how to manage a deployment in the Planner and gather feedback from users.
