You're happy with how your virtual summit worked out, and people have already commented how they've enjoyed it. A large part of running a successful, engaging, and inclusive event is capturing feedback from everyone. There are also other actions that are good to do and by completing them you are setting yourself up for future event success.

Here you'll learn about common post event actions that an event team should complete. These steps are applicable to any kind of event.

## Processing feedback

> [!TIP]
> **Thank your team**: Your event team has successfully produced a virtual event, use all those gained skills to host a "Wrap Party" either in-person or virtually. It's a great way to say thank you for all their hard work. If this has been a large scale or high profile event see if you can arrange time for everyone involved to recuperate.

The focus here's on attendees. Provide clear and easy to follow instructions for how to complete your post event survey. Use your attendee list to provide reminders where they've not been completed. That being said, it's also a good idea to ask your event team, presenters, organizers, and moderators to also complete the survey.

Your presenters will be keen to understand how satisfied attendees are. Try to collate your survey results and provide feedback to the presenters as quickly as possible. The industry norm is within 72 hours of the event finishing.

If your virtual event was run using Live Events, you can make use of extra quality metrics. Once the Live Event ends as a producer or presenter you can download the Q & A report, and an attendee engagement report.

## Content publishing

Attendees, and people who wanted to attend your event, will be keen to download and review the live content. Although your slides and pre-recorded video can be made available right away, you may want to post process any live recordings before making them available. For example, to include professional captioning in different languages. Consider converting any slides or other content to a published Sway website and PDF's for maximum availability.

Consider sending out a "Thank you for attending" communication to attendees. The communication can include a reminder to complete the post event survey and include links to download all the event content.

Consider sending out a "Thanks for making it great" communication to your events team and presenters. Without them the event couldn't have happened.

Talk about the success of your event, highlighting the available content and to publicly thank all your presenters. This can be blog or social media posts, alongside internal email and other communication channels.

## Future strategy

Bring all the above together to think about how you can improve your next event. Is there a benefit to continuing to engage with your audience? How could you run follow up engagements?

Is it possible for you to build a community around the event? Is it appropriate to have a forum where attendees and presenters can continue conversations?

Like all projects, a postmortem allows you to look back on what went well, and what could be improved on in the future. Schedule some time to complete a full event review to capture operational improvements you and other teams can apply to your next event.
