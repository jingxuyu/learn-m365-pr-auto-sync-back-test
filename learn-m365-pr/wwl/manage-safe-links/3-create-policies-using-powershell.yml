  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson created a Safe Links policy using Exchange Online PowerShell. After navigating to the ATP Safe Links page in the Security and Compliance Center, Holly couldn't find the Safe Links policy. What prevented the Safe Links policy that Holly created in PowerShell from appearing in the SCC?"
    choices:
    - content: "Holly didn't create a safe links rule in the SCC"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You don't create separate safe links rules in the SCC. Try again."
    - content: "Holly didn't assign the policy to a safe links rule in PowerShell"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A new safe links policy that you create in PowerShell isn't visible in the Security &amp; Compliance Center until you assign the policy to a safe links rule in PowerShell."
    - content: "Holly should have created a Safe Links rule before creating the Safe Links policy in PowerShell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In PowerShell, you must create a Safe Links policy first and then create a Safe Links rule and assign it to the policy. Try again."
