In some situations, you might want to lock down a computer so that it can run only a single Universal Windows app. A computer that is configured this way might be in a public area, such as in a library, at a kiosk, or in a coffee shop. In fact, it is the user account that you are restricting rather than the computer.

To restrict a user account to run a single Universal Windows app, perform the following procedure:

1.  From the Start menu, select **Settings**.
2.  Select **Accounts**, and then select **Other people**.
3.  In the right pane, select **Set up assigned access**.
4.  Select **Choose an account**, and then select the account that you want to restrict.
5.  Select **Choose an app**, and then select the installed application to which you want to restrict the account.
6.  Sign out from the computer to make the changes effective.

When the user signs in to the computer, they will be able to access only the assigned application. You can assign access only to users that have previously signed in to that computer and have the application installed.
