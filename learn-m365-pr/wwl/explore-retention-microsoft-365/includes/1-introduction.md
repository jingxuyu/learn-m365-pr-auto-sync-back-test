The different Microsoft 365 locations, such as Exchange mailboxes and SharePoint document libraries, have become repositories of valuable data. They're a common medium for communication and collaboration between information workers in organizations of all sizes. As a best practice, organizations should establish policies to control the life cycle of all messaging data and SharePoint content that's saved across the different locations.

To assist organizations achieve this goal, Microsoft 365 lets organizations both delete data and protect data against deletion in the following locations:

 -  Exchange email
 -  SharePoint sites
 -  OneDrive accounts
 -  Microsoft 365 groups
 -  Skype for Business
 -  Exchange public folders
 -  Teams channel messages
 -  Teams chats

Even with good data governance, SharePoint sites can proliferate and grow out of control. Sites are created as they're needed, but sites are rarely deleted. If sites persist when they're no longer needed, they require storage space and they might be unwanted for compliance reasons.

Deletion and preservation of data is managed across the different services in the following ways:

 -  Retention policies in Exchange help organizations to manage the email lifecycle and reduce legal risks associated with email and other messaging elements.
 -  Retention policies in Security and Compliance Center (SCC) make it easier to keep data needed to follow company policy, government regulations, or legal needs, and to remove content that has no legal or business value.
 -  Retention settings specify how long a message remains in a mailbox or document library and the action to be taken when the message reaches the specified retention age.

This module describes how data can be retained and ultimately removed in Microsoft 365. It begins by comparing Message Records Management in Exchange to retention policies in the Security and Compliance Center. It then examines the types of retention tags that can be applied to Exchange mailboxes. The module concludes by reviewing how to create and manage retention policies in the Security and Compliance Center.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Explain how a retention policy works.
 -  Compare Message Records Management in Exchange and retention policies in the Security and Compliance Center.
 -  Understand how Message Records Management works in Exchange.
 -  Identify the types of retention tags that can be applied to Exchange mailboxes.
 -  Create a retention policy in the Security and Compliance Center.
 -  Manage existing retention policies in the Security and Compliance Center.
