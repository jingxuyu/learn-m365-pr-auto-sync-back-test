Setting up Viva Connections is a multi-step process that requires
detailed planning and collaborative team effort that’s covered in [module

access and use Viva Connections.

In this module, you'll learn how to build your organization’s unique
Viva Connections experience through a step-by-step guide. You will use
insights from various types of stakeholders to make decisions. Keep in
mind that stakeholders may look different based on the organization.

Before building Viva Connections, ensure technical requirements have
been met. In the build phase, tasks will be focused on setting up the
