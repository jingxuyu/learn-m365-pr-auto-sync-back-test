Here are the steps to add an upload feature to your app.

## Display a browser input element and event handler for the upload

1. Open the *index.html* file.

1. Extend the `content` block with the content shown underneath the `Add for file upload` comment.

    ```html
    <div id="content" style="display: none;">
        <h4>Welcome <span id="userName"></span></h4>
        <!-- Add for file download -->
        <hr />
        <label>Files in your OneDrive root folder:</label>
        <ul id="downloadLinks"></ul>
        <!-- Add for file upload -->
        <hr />
        <input type="file" onchange="fileSelected(this);" />
        <div id="uploadMessage"></div>
    </div>
    ```
    
1. Now open the *ui.js* file in your code editor, and add these functions at the bottom.

    ```javascript
    function fileSelected(e) {
        displayUploadMessage(`Uploading ${e.files[0].name}...`);
        uploadFile(e.files[0])
        .then((response) => {
          displayUploadMessage(`File ${response.name} of ${response.size} bytes uploaded`);
          displayFiles();
        });
    }
    
    function displayUploadMessage(message) {
        const messageElement = document.getElementById('uploadMessage');
        messageElement.innerText = message;
    }
    ```

## Add a function to upload the file by using the Microsoft Graph SDK

1. Open the *graph.js* file in your code editor.

1. Add this function at the bottom of the file.

    ```javascript
    async function uploadFile(file) {
        try {
            ensureScope('files.readwrite');
            let options = {
                path: "/",
                fileName: file.name,
                rangeSize: 1024 * 1024 // must be a multiple of 320 KiB
            };
            const uploadTask = 
                await MicrosoftGraph.OneDriveLargeFileUploadTask
                  .create(graphClient, file, options);
            const response = await uploadTask.upload();
            console.log(`File ${response.name} of ${response.size} bytes uploaded`);
            return response;
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error);
        }
    }
    ```

1. Ensure you save the *graph.js* file before you continue.

## Run the app

Refresh your browser. When you sign in, you should see an upload button.

:::image type="content" source="../media/6-upload-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the File upload button in the browser." border="false":::

Select the button, and choose a file from your computer. You might notice that the first time you upload you see a new consent pop-up window requesting permission to write and read files. When the file begins uploading, a message appears.

:::image type="content" source="../media/7-upload-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows choosing a file to upload." border="false":::

The first time you do this, you'll see another consent pop-up window because now you're asking to write files.

:::image type="content" source="../media/8-consent-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows consenting to upload files." border="false":::

When the upload is complete, the message shows the number of bytes uploaded and the file appears in the files list.

Stop your Node.js server by selecting Ctrl+C in your terminal window.
