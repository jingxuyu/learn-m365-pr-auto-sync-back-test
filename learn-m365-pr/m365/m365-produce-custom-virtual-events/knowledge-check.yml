  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "After moderating a virtual event, you want to share notes and next steps with the participants. Where can you get a list of everyone who attended (not just who was invited)?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the meeting invite in Outlook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's not correct. The meeting invite in Outlook shows who was invited to the meeting but not who attended the meeting."
    - content: "In the meeting invite in Teams, under the Live event resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To download the meeting roster, which shows who attended the meeting, use the download button in the Participants pane in the meeting item in Teams."
    - content: "In the meeting transcript."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's not correct. The meeting transcript contains the automatically transcribed captions for everything that was said in the meeting."
  - content: "One of the recommendations for presenters is to use two monitors. Why is this a best practice?"
    choices:
    - content: "You use one monitor for your camera and one for your content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's not correct. Using two monitors lets you share your content from one monitor and use the other for speaker notes, the Teams window, and other applications that you don't want to share with participants."
    - content: "Teams Live Events require two monitors to display all of the content."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's not correct. Using two monitors lets you share your content from one monitor and use the other for speaker notes, the Teams window, and other applications that you don't want to share with participants."
    - content: "You use one monitor for your content and the other for the Teams meeting or to take notes and use other apps."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Using two monitors lets you share your content from one monitor and use the other for speaker notes, the Teams window, and other applications that you don't want to share with participants."
  - content: "Which of the following choices is not one of the ways moderators help ensure the success of your event?"
    choices:
    - content: "Triaging and aggregating questions from attendees."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's not correct. Managing questions from attendees *is* one of the moderator's tasks."
    - content: "Muting and unmuting the audience."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Sorry, that's not correct. Muting and unmuting the attendees *is* one of the moderator's tasks."
    - content: "Creating the meeting invitation and lining up speakers"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Creating the event itself is the responsibility of the organizer. In our training, this is generally a different role than the moderator."
