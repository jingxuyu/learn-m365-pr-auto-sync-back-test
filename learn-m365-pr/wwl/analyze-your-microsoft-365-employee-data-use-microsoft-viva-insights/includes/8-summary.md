Microsoft Viva Insights provides a workplace analytics solution. This module examined how this cloud-based feature of Viva Insights uses the power of Microsoft 365 collaboration data for creating analysis about:

 -  How an organization spends its time.
 -  The ways people network.
 -  The effectiveness of team collaboration.

This module explored how organizations use Viva Insights to:

 -  See business outcomes and their related research-based behavioral insights. This information shows how things get done in an organization starting with the Home page.
 -  Use the Explore the stats, Explore in Power BI, and Plans options for more in-depth analysis specific to an organization's data.
 -  Use the Query designer's templates and queries to jump-start an organization's analysis. These templates can be customized for more focused or in-depth analysis.
 -  Analyze a specific business process with the Business process analysis feature.
 -  Compare metrics between groups with the Peer analysis feature.
 -  Select targeted change plans to improve focus, collaboration, wellbeing, and sales success.
 -  Use the Controls pages to validate uploaded data sources and to set up analyst settings, system defaults, and privacy settings.

This module stressed how "Privacy is key" is the underlying mantra of Viva Insights. As such, it only uses header level metadata. You learned that attachments and text in the body of email and meetings are never used. Furthermore, rights-managed, confidential, and private email and meetings are excluded altogether.
