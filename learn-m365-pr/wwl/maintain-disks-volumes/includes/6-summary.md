This module examined methods of managing storage devices and data. Windows settings provide an overview of the data on a disk by category, providing a simplified view to identify what type of data is consuming how much space. Disk management has become largely automated, as Windows will automatically defragment hard disk drives or optimize solid-state drives. Windows provides compression capabilities on NTFS drives to designate which folders or files are stored in a compressed state. This is an alternative to compressing files into a zipped folder, providing more available space on the drive.
