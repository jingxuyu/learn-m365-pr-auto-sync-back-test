To use the Microsoft Store for Business, organizations must meet the following prerequisites:

 -  **Internet connectivity.** The Microsoft Store for Business is hosted in the public cloud. To browse and administer the Microsoft Store for Business, a device must have Internet connectivity.
 -  **Windows 10 devices.** You can only browse the Microsoft Store for Business from Windows 10 devices, version 1511 or later. Windows 10 includes the Microsoft Store app, which can be used to access the public Microsoft Store and the Microsoft Store for Business.
 -  **Windows Update service must be enabled.** To use the Microsoft Store for Business, the Windows Update service must be enabled on the device. The Windows Update service is used for detecting, downloading, and installing updates for Windows operating systems, and for apps from the Microsoft Store for Business.
 -  **Supported web browser for administering the Microsoft Store for Business.** An organization's users don't need a web browser for browsing and installing Microsoft Store for Business apps. However, administrators do need a web browser for managing the Microsoft Store for Business. It can be managed using Internet Explorer 10 or later, Microsoft Edge, or current versions of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. JavaScript must be supported and enabled.
 -  **Azure AD account.** To manage or browse the Microsoft Store for Business, you must first sign into it with an Azure AD account. An Azure AD account is required, and you can't use the Microsoft Store for Business without one. When using a management tool for deploying online-licensed apps, the users who will deploy the apps must also have Azure AD accounts. The Azure AD sign-up process is fast, straightforward, and similar to signing up for other cloud services.

If all prerequisites are met, users can access, browse, and install apps from the Microsoft Store for Business. Administrators can also assign apps to users. When users are assigned an app, they're notified by email. They're then able to install the apps locally.

### Requirements to integrate the Microsoft Store for Business with management tools

While not required, organizations can use a management tool to distribute and manage apps. Using a management tool enables organizations to:

 -  distribute content
 -  scope app availability
 -  control when app updates are installed

Using a management tool can make sense for larger organizations that already use one, such as Microsoft Intune or Configuration Manager. When using a management tool, organizations must:

 -  Integrate it with Windows 10 management framework and Azure AD.
 -  Sync it with the Microsoft Store for Business inventory to distribute apps.
