As a senior administrator working for Contoso, you've been asked to adopt the application delivery method and to use the MSIX app attach in your Windows Virtual Desktop environment.

## Exercise: Use MSIX app attach in Windows Virtual Desktop

You decide to implement MSIX app attach delivery of the new applications in your Windows Virtual Desktop.

In this exercise, you will add and test app deployed using MSIX app attach.
You will:

- Add MSIX app attach in Windows Virtual Desktop
