In your large multinational organization, you were concerned about weak passwords and poor security practices. You wanted to ensure that access and identity provisioning was simplified and that authentication in Teams was strengthened. You also wanted to explain how to manage Teams endpoints.

Using only usernames and passwords are no longer sufficient to protect against security attacks. Microsoft Teams is built on the Microsoft 365 and Office 365 hyper-scale, enterprise-grade cloud, delivering the advanced security and compliance capabilities our customers expect.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to simplify access and identity provisioning in Microsoft Teams.
- Demonstrate how to strengthen authentication in Microsoft Teams.
- Explain how to manage Microsoft Teams endpoints.
