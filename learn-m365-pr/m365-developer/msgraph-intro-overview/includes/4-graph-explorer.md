Microsoft Graph Explorer is a free, open-source tool where you can make Microsoft Graph REST API requests without any installation or setup. It's a great place to start practicing and learning Microsoft Graph APIs before consuming them in applications. 

Graph Explorer is a web application that's available in any modern browser. In the sales application scenario, your development team can use Graph Explorer to prototype the initial API calls and see the type of data returned. 

Here's a quick overview of the Graph Explorer tool: 

1. Graph Explorer is available at https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer. 
2. An HTTP verb drop-down list helps you modify your HTTP requests such as **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**. 
3. A version drop-down list helps you change the API version in the query to **v1.0** or **beta**. 
4. A query editor lets you modify the query and see the results by selecting the **Run query** button. 
5. Sample Graph API queries are available for you to search through and test. 
6. A selected query will automatically run and show the results in Graph Explorer. 
7. A link to related API documentation is available on the right side of each sample query.
