  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can adaptive cards be used in task modules?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create the Adaptive Card in App Studio. When invoking the task module, specify the `cardId` property in the `TaskModuleTaskInfo` object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "App Studio can be used to create and preview cards, but they aren't registered for use within App Studio."
    - content: "Attach the JSON for the Adaptive Card to the `card` property on the `TaskModuleTaskInfo` object."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The Adaptive Card JSON is loaded with a JavaScript control within the HTML page used for the task module."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Task modules are either HTML pages or Adaptive Cards; Adaptive Cards aren't loaded into task modules via an HTML page."
  - content: "How does a tab get the value(s) from an Adaptive Card's submit action?"
    choices:
    - content: "Similar to web page task modules, all properties are returned in the `result` object of the callback defined in the `startTask()` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Adaptive cards include an additional property, `cardSubmission`, on the `result` object passed to the callback defined in the `startTask()` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct; a special property isn't created on the `result` for Adaptive Cards."
    - content: "Adaptive Cards submit responses to the endpoint specified on the `card` property on the `TaskModuleTaskInfo` object."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This isn't correct; Adaptive Cards include the values of all input controls in the `result` object of the configured callback."
