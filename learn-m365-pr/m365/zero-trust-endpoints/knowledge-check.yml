  questions:
  - content: "Why is it important to identify your attack surface?"
    choices:
    - content: "It helps you to understand all the ways in which a cybercriminal could launch an attack."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. As endpoints become more important to our lives, attack surfaces will continue to get larger and more pervasive. You need to find ways to prevent cybercriminals from exploiting your attack surface."
    - content: "It's a feature of a modern device management solution that lets you monitor endpoints."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Identifying your attack surface can help you to investigate useful features for protection but attack surface isn't a feature itself. Instead, think about all the endpoints in an organization. Cybercriminals can exploit a single endpoint, so how would you define its collective endpoints?"
    - content: "It describes the detailed recommended settings for security to stop an ongoing attack."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An attack surface doesn't describe settings. Instead, focus on endpoints. Organizations have many endpoints that a cybercriminal can potentially exploit. How would you define its collective endpoints based on this threat?"
  - content: "Why should you register your endpoints with a cloud identity provider?"
    choices:
    - content: "This enables your organization to update device configurations using compliance policies."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While updated device configurations can help you to protect endpoints, you wouldn't use identity providers to handle device configurations. Instead, think about the purpose of a user account. Why would you need one?"
    - content: "It enables you to decommission endpoints with a single switch when they're no longer used. "
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Identity providers can help you to find endpoints used across your organization, and even block an account associated with an endpoint. But this alone wouldn't be enough to ensure a device can no longer be used."
    - content: "This enables your organization to see and manage access to endpoints."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This will enable your organization to monitor and secure access in a way that encompasses all the endpoints that are used by everyone."
  - content: "Your organization uses compliance policies to satisfy security requirements. What should your organization do for noncompliant devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "Your organization should set remediation rules when you create compliance policies."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. For example, you can create a rule that alerts the user via email, block the endpoint, or give it a grace period after which the endpoint will be blocked if it isn't compliant."
    - content: "Your organization should configure security baselines to remediate noncompliant devices."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While security baselines help define recommended security settings, this alone isn't enough to rectify noncompliant endpoints."
    - content: "Your organization should update those devices so that they automatically become compliant."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. While updating devices is generally a good idea, this alone doesn't necessarily address compliance issues. For example, you might encounter compliance problems that have nothing to do with device updates."
