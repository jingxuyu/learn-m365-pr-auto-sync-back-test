  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "You've moderated a successful live event in Teams. Now, you want to download the roster of participants. Where can you obtain this list?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the meeting invite in Outlook."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. The meeting invite in Outlook shows who was invited to the meeting but not who attended the meeting."
    - content: "In the meeting invite in Teams, under the Live event resources."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. To download the meeting roster, which shows who attended the meeting, use the download button in the Participants pane in the meeting item in Teams."
    - content: "In the meeting transcript."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. The meeting transcript contains the automatically transcribed captions for everything that was said in the meeting."
  - content: "You've been asked to present a segment at an online board meeting for your company. You want to ensure that you have a reliable network connection during the meeting. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use only one screen with a low resolution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. Using a single small screen will not improve your network connection."
    - content: "Use a mobile network dongle."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. The mobile network in your area may not provide a more reliable network connection than a broadband internet connection."
    - content: "Use an Ethernet cable to plug your computer directly into your router."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Using a physical Ethernet cable is likely to give a faster, more reliable connection than your wifi network."
  - content: "After a recent presentation, you received feedback that the sound was distorted by loud pops when you pronounced 'B' and 'P' sounds. What should you do to improve for the next presentation?"
    choices:
    - content: "Place the microphone closer to your mouth"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. By placing the microphone closer to your mouth, you'll reduce echoes from the room but will make plosive distortion worse."
    - content: "Use a large-diaphragm microphone"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not correct. By using a large-diaphragm microphone, you'll capture a full spectrum of sound but will make plosive distortion worse."
    - content: "Use a pop shield"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Pop shields are designed to reduce the distortion associated with plosive vocal sounds."
