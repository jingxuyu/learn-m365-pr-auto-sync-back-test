Microsoft Search is included with desktop and online versions of Office 365 apps. It can also be accessed from the Windows Search box, the Microsoft Edge New tab page, or from any browser at Bing.com or Office.com.

- In **Office apps**, including modern SharePoint sites, you'll find the Microsoft Search box in the header bar:

No matter where you start your work or school search, the results will always be private and secure. Users authenticate by signing in to their Azure Active Directory account and only see results for files, sites, and other information shared with them.

Also, all search requests from Microsoft Search in Bing are made over HTTPS and the connection is encrypted. Work searches on Bing are de-identified and logs are separated from public search traffic.
