When companies consider cloud solutions, they usually focus on three areas: 

![3 areas of cloud focus](../media/4-which-cloud-model.png)

- Cost
- Security/reliability and compliance
- Functionality 

Because different companies have different priorities, these three categories aren’t of equal importance for everyone. While some smaller companies might favor lower cost over functionality, some larger, more complex companies might have security and compliance as their top priority. 

In terms of an organization’s operational activities, timing can also be a key factor. Consider the following circumstances:

- **Recent investment in hardware.** A medium-sized company that has made a significant investment in new hardware for their on-premises datacenter one year ago likely won’t be interested in any major shift to the cloud for at least year or two. Companies in a similar situation will likely opt for a limited hybrid cloud model that focuses on providing functionalities they lack in their local datacenter. 
- **Outdated hardware and systems.** In contrast to the previous example, a company that’s considering a local datacenter renewal versus cloud-based solutions as a replacement can have a very different perspective. If they have old hardware and unsupported versions of software running in their datacenter, they’ll be more likely to consider moving to the cloud. Moreover, if the cloud offering meets their security and compliance requirements, the relative cost and the type of cost model (OpEx vs. CapEx) will probably be the deciding factors. 
- **Limited in-house IT resources**. A significant factor when considering moving to cloud-based solutions is the size and skill set of the organization’s IT department. A company with very limited local IT resources will most likely adopt cloud services faster because they require no IT hardware and software maintenance skills. Some companies with larger IT organizations might consider the cloud as a way to reduce the number of their local IT personnel. Although a personnel reduction mindset might not be the best reason to move to the cloud, freeing those IT resources from having to perform datacenter maintenance tasks to focus on more strategic IT functions adds value to the organization. 
- **Limited budget.** Cloud-only organizations are still rare. Those who can most readily transition to the cloud are typically smaller companies, startups, and nonprofits without any funds available to invest in hardware beyond employee laptops or desktops. This same financial constraint can give these companies an advantage for the future. If they succeed in their organization, most will probably stay with a cloud-only model and can therefore avoid any CapEx for their IT on an ongoing basis.
