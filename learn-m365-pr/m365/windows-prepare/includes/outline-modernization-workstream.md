Your technical director wants to use Desktop Analytics to help facilitate the feature update. As the process manager, you want the team to better understand what Desktop Analytics is, and how the team will use it as part of the deployment process.

## Benefits of Desktop Analytics

As the process manager, you explain that Desktop Analytics provides Woodgrove with many advantages that it can use to improve the environment’s application and device readiness. For example:

- **Device and software inventory**: Easily manage an inventory of devices and applications across your whole estate
- **Pilot identification**: Desktop Analytics helps Woodgrove identify what should be the best and smallest number of devices that it should use to validate for widest coverage of real-world usage

- **Issue identification**: Desktop Analytics can identify potential issues proactively and will suggest recommendations to deal with issues

## Requirements for Desktop Analytics

You explain that Woodgrove needs to meet [requirements](/configmgr/desktop-analytics/overview#prerequisites) to use Desktop Analytics, including the following:

-   An Active Azure subscription, along with an account that has the Global Administrator role
-   Configuration Manager (version 1902 or later), with the Full Administrator role
-   Devices can connect to Microsoft’s public cloud services
-   Access to Windows Diagnostic data (at least Basic level, Enhanced level is recommended)
