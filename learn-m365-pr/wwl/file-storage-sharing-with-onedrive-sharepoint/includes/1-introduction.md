Moving workloads to the cloud allows you to implement a worldwide resource your employees can use to share files, manage projects, and participate in online meetings. You can easily and securely store and access files from all your devices. Employees can work with others regardless of whether they're inside or outside your organization, and terminate that sharing whenever they want. Microsoft 365 helps you communicate at scale to reach people wherever they are with compelling digital employee experiences.
