Let’s look at the journey of a file and discuss how Microsoft technologies can help protect the data within that file.

**File is created**

- Regardless of where the file is created, sensitivity labeling in Office apps can enforce information protection based on the labels attached to the data.

**User edits the file**

- The label is updated based on the user's changes and the content's sensitivity. This ensure the file has the right protection.

**User shares the file with another user in the organization**

- As an additional layer of protection, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies in Office 365 help prevent the accidental or inadvertent sharing of sensitive documents and emails.

**User opens the file on their phone**

- If a user receives and opens the data on a mobile device, Intune enforces protection of the data.

**User uploads the file to another cloud service such as Dropbox**

- If a user uploads the data to other clouds for external sharing, services such as Microsoft Cloud App Security can apply policies based on the data’s labels.
