  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso has an existing auto attendant and call queue infrastructure. With its recent Microsoft 365 deployment, It currently uses auto attendants and call queues to connect callers to people within the company and wants to migrate its calling environment to Microsoft Teams. What must Contoso do to port its existing phone numbers to Microsoft Teams Phone?"
    choices:
    - content: "Set Teams-only coexistence mode for agents"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. If you set agents' Teams accounts to Teams-only mode, agents who don't meet the requirements aren't included in the call routing list. This feature has nothing to do with porting existing phone numbers to Microsoft Teams Phone."
    - content: "Implement Conference mode"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Conference mode is call queue option that significantly reduces the amount of time it takes to connect Teams VOIP calls and PSTN calls to an agent. This feature has nothing to do with porting existing phone numbers to Microsoft Teams Phone."
    - content: "Create a plan to transfer its existing phone numbers to the new auto attendants and call queues in Teams Phone"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If you have an existing auto attendant and call queue infrastructure and you're migrating to Teams, you'll need a plan to transfer your existing phone numbers to the new auto attendants and call queues."
  - content: "Contoso's Microsoft 365 project team is considering using a Teams channel for their call agents. In doing so, they can assign an outbound caller ID number for the agents by specifying one or more resource accounts with a phone number. What should Contoso's project team consider doing if they don't use a Teams channel to control agent membership?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implement presence-based routing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Presence-based routing uses the availability status of call agents to determine whether an agent should be included in the call routing list for the selected routing method."
    - content: "Set the caller ID for members of the call queue to the service number of the call queue or appropriate auto attendant"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If you're not using a Teams channel to control agent membership, consider directly setting the caller ID for members of the call queue to the service number of the call queue or appropriate auto attendant."
    - content: "Set the routing method to round robin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Round robin routing method balances the routing of incoming calls so that each call agent gets the same number of calls from the queue."
  - content: "If no tenant scoped dial plan is defined, and no tenant user scoped dial plan is assigned to the provisioned user, which service dialing plan should an organization plan to use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Service Country/Region + Tenant Global-scoped"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This dialing plan applies if a tenant user dial plan is defined but not assigned to a user."
    - content: "Service Country/Region + Tenant User-scoped"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This dialing plan applies if a tenant user dial plan is defined and assigned to a user."
    - content: "Service Country/Region"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If no tenant scoped dial plan is defined and no tenant user scoped dial plan is assigned to the provisioned user, the user will receive an effective dial plan mapped to the service country/region associated with their usage location."
  - content: "As the Teams administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Patti Fernandez wants to enable call parking and retrieve for the company's users. To enable call parking and retrieve, what value must Patti set the Coexistence mode to in the Teams admin center?"
    choices:
    - content: "Teams only"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Call park and retrieve is only available in Teams Only deployment mode."
    - content: "Islands"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option isn't the correct value that Coexistence mode must be set to in the Teams admin center."
    - content: "Skype for Business with Teams collaboration and meetings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option isn't the correct value that Coexistence mode must be set to in the Teams admin center."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Teams Phone is the logical extension of Microsoft Teams that can work with or replace an organization's existing private branch exchange (PBX) used by its staff to make internal and external calls. With Teams Phone, users can use Teams to place, receive, and transfer calls using their mobile devices, a headset with a laptop or PC, or one of many IP phones that work with Teams."

  - content: "What does Microsoft Teams require for each auto attendant and call queue?"
    choices:
    - content: "A service number"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Service numbers are optional for auto attendants and call queues."
    - content: "A Teams resource account"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft Teams requires a resource account for each auto attendant or call queue. Teams resource accounts aren't the same as Microsoft 365 resource accounts. Microsoft 365 resource accounts are tied to an Exchange Online mailbox and enable booking of shared resources, such as rooms."
    - content: "A Microsoft 365 resource account"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft 365 resource accounts are tied to an Exchange Online mailbox and enable booking of shared resources, such as rooms."

    - content: "Call park policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A call park policy enables an organization's users to place calls on hold."
    - content: "Caller ID policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A caller ID policy enables an organization to change or block the caller ID, display an alternate phone number for Teams users, block the outbound phone number, and block an incoming number from being displayed."
    - content: "Calling policy"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In Microsoft Teams, calling policies control which calling and call forwarding features are available to users. The features that Allan wants to implement for Northwind Traders are enabled with calling policies."
