## Activity explorer

**Activity explorer** gives you a better understanding of activities related to your data. It provides visibility into document-level activities like label changes and label downgrades (like when someone changes a label from confidential to public). You can use the filters to see all the details for a specific label, including file types, users, and activities. Activity explorer enables you to understand what is being done with your labeled content over time. You can use activity explorer to evaluate if the controls already in place, such as DLP policies, are effective. You can update your policies and take action to restrict undesired behavior if you discover something unexpected.
