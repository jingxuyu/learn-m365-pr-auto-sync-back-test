Your Microsoft 365 subscription includes some features, like Office 365 and Intune, that are delivered as a service through a Software as a Service model. Software as a service (SaaS), is software that’s centrally hosted and managed by a cloud service provider for its customers. The software architecture typically uses one version of the application for all customers and is licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics CRM Online are examples of SaaS.
