Workplace Analytics includes four user roles, with different data-access rights and responsibilities:

1. The **Microsoft 365 administrator** assigns Workplace Analytics licenses to user mailboxes and the other Workplace Analytics roles to users. This role doesn't have access to the Workplace Analytics application (unless they assign themselves one of the Workplace Analytics roles).
2. The **Workplace Analytics administrator** sets system defaults and privacy settings for your company's Workplace Analytics environment and is responsible for uploading and verifying organizational/HR data. This role can access the **Settings** menu, and through it, the **Data sources**, **Upload**, and **Admin settings** pages.
3. A **Workplace Analytics analyst** has full access to all Workplace Analytics features (except the **Settings** menu) and can directly query the full dataset. This role is typically assigned to analysts who need complete data access to perform their analyses.
4. A **Workplace Analytics analyst (limited)** has the same access as the analyst role but has the following restrictions:
   - No access to Queries
   - Read-only access to the **Analysis settings** page

To get started with Workplace Analytics, your Microsoft 365 Administrator will need to assign the roles of Workplace Analytics administrator and Workplace Analytics analyst.

>[!NOTE]
>Only users with Workplace Analytics roles assigned can sign into the Workplace Analytics web application and access the data.
