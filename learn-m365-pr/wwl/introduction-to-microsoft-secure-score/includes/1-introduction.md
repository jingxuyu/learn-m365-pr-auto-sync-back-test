Microsoft Secure Score is a security analytics tool designed to help organizations understand what they've done to reduce the risk to their data and show them what they can do to further reduce that risk. Secure Score determines what Microsoft 365 services an organization is using. It then looks at its configuration and behaviors and compares it to a baseline that's configured by Microsoft.

Rather than reacting or responding to security alerts, the Secure Score tool enables organizations to track and plan incremental improvements over a longer period of time.

In this module, you'll be introduced to the Microsoft Secure Score tool and its benefits.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 *  Describe the benefits of Secure Score and what kind of services can be analyzed.

 *  Describe how to use the tool to identify gaps between your current state and where you would like to be regarding security.
 *  Identify actions that will increase your security by mitigating risks.
 *  Explain where to look to determine the threats each action will mitigate and the impact it has on users.
