Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you by providing a single, modern, integrated management platform for managing, protecting, and monitoring all of your organization's endpoints. These endpoints may also include the on-premises computers and devices used by your organization. Co-management is concurrently managing Windows 10 or later devices with both Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune.
