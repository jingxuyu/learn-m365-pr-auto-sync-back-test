The Security &amp; Compliance Center (SCC) enables organizations to manage their data protection and compliance. It does this in part by providing a Security Dashboard. Organizations can use this tool to review their threat protection status and view and act on security alerts.

The Security Dashboard provides insights into an organization’s threat landscape around the globe. It provides a variety of features, including:

 -  a color-coded chart of weekly threat detections.
 -  graphs of malware trends and malware families detected.
 -  security trends in the industry.
 -  a heat-map of attack origins for an organization's specific tenant.
 -  a list of top targeted users.
 -  a list of recent alerts.

The Security Dashboard provides Chief Information Security Officers (CISO’s) with broad and deep visibility into their organizations' enterprise threat landscape. This information helps CISO's determine:

 -  the origin of threats.
 -  the potential threat actors.
 -  the users impacted by threats.
 -  the types of threats.
 -  how best to remediate existing threats and proactively develop strategies against future threats.

The dashboard is an excellent resource for technical security experts to use when reporting to business decision makers, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Technical Officer (CTO).

The dashboard is also an entry to Microsoft Threat Explorer. Many of the links in the dashboard connect these two views of your threat intelligence. For example, the Threat Investigation panel on the Security Dashboard has links that drill down into Threat Explorer. This design enables the dashboard to display messages that were removed after delivery and locate malicious messages that were sent to someone in the organization.

Depending on what an organization's Microsoft 365 subscription includes, the Security Dashboard may include the following features:

 -  Threat protection status
 -  Insights
 -  Threat management
 -  Trends

These Security Dashboard features are introduced in the following sections.

### Threat protection status

In the upper left corner of the Security Dashboard is a threat protection status tile that shows threat protection effectiveness. This tile tells you at a glance how many threats were blocked by Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 (if configured) over the last seven days. This tile also shows the number of email messages detected as misclassified and reported by using the [Report Message add-in](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/report-message-addin-b5caa9f1-cdf3-4443-af8c-ff724ea719d2). Administrators can review their anti-spam, anti-malware, and anti-phishing policies to improve their configuration.

In addition, Malware reports can be used to track recent trends in malicious content targeted at an organization.

### Insights

Insights not only identify key issues you should review, they also include recommendations and actions to consider. For example, you may see that phishing email messages are being delivered because some users have disabled their junk mail options.

### Threat management

The Threat Management Summary tile tells an organization at a glance how it was protected from threats over the past seven (7) days.

The information you'll see in the Threat Management Summary depends on what you subscription includes. The following table describes what information is included for Office 365 E3 and Office 365 E5.

To view or access the Threat Management Summary widget, you must have permissions to view Defender for Office 365 reports.

### Trends

Near the bottom of the Security Dashboard is a **Trends** section, which summarizes email flow trends for your organization. Reports provide information about email categorized as spam, malware, phishing attempts, and good email.

If an organization's Microsoft 365 subscription includes Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence, it will also have a **Recent threat management alerts** report in this section. This reports will enable its security team to view and take action on high-priority security alerts.
