A desktop app operation issue is any situation in which a desktop app does not perform properly from the user’s perspective. Some of the issues that you or your users might encounter include:

 -  **Missing application features**. In many applications, you can select which features to install. An application’s default installation options might not include all of the features that a user requires.
 -  **Missing Windows operating system features**. Some applications require Windows operating system features to function correctly. This includes different versions of Microsoft .NET Framework.
 -  **Incorrect configuration**. An application’s post-installation default settings might not be appropriate. To fit your needs, you can customize the application’s settings, such as the default locations for saving files and folders. Some desktop apps also might need open ports in the firewall. Users might not have access to start all applications, or some file permissions might be insufficient for users to run the application.
 -  **Poor performance**. Applications might run slower than users expect. This can happen when users perform a specific task, when devices do not meet the minimum hardware requirements, or during regular application use.
 -  **Application errors**. Any error that the application displays on the screen is a desktop app operation issue.
 -  **Incorrect database connection settings**. Some desktop apps use a server database as a data store. If you do not configure the connection to the database correctly, the application cannot function correctly.
 -  **Application blocking by AppLocker**. You can configure AppLocker to allow or block applications on Windows devices. If AppLocker is blocking an approved desktop app, then you must try to resolve the issue.

Issues with desktop app operations can influence a user’s job performance. Therefore, you must identify and troubleshoot these issues as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Before you deploy a desktop app, you should put it through a thorough testing process that includes common user activities. Desktop support staff often performs this testing, but you might want to include users in this testing process as well. During testing, the desktop app might not function as you expect, which results in the need for further troubleshooting.

After you deploy a desktop app, users are the most common source for information about issues with application operations. When you investigate issues with desktop app operations, you can use on-screen error messages and event logs. In some cases, these messages and logs provide enough information to resolve the issue. In other cases, you might need to perform more research. Additional research might include:

 -  Searching the vendor’s website.
 -  Searching the Internet.
 -  Contacting vendor support.
