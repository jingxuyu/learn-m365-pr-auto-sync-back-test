quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailwind Traders, which up until last month was located in Paris, France. When Tailwind purchased its Microsoft 365 subscription two years ago, its Organization Profile listed the country/region in which the company is headquartered as France. However, Tailwind recently moved its corporate headquarters to New York. To change the company's headquarters for its Microsoft 365 subscription to the United States, what must you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to access Tailwind's Organization Profile and change the country/region of the company's headquarters to the United States"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can't use the Microsoft 365 admin center to change your company's headquarters. Try again."
    - content: "Contact Microsoft Support Services and have them update the country/region of your Microsoft 365 subscription to the United States"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft Support Services won't change your company's headquarters. Try again."
    - content: "Sign up for a new account, choose the United States as the desired country/region, and purchase a new subscription"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Because the country/region where your organization is headquartered determines which services are available to you, the taxes and billing currency, and the location of the Microsoft data center, changing the location of the company headquarters requires that you sign up for a new account, choose the desired country/region, and purchase a new subscription."
