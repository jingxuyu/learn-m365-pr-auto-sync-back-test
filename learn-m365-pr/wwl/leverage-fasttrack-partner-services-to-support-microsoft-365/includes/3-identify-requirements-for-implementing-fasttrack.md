### Microsoft’s responsibility

Microsoft is available during onboarding to provide remote assistance in planning the development and implementation of Microsoft 365.

 *  During the Initiation phase, Microsoft works with you to understand your organization’s goals, define the services you plan to onboard, and begin the onboarding process.
 *  During the Assessment phase, Microsoft provides an overview and guidance on internal services such as DNS, network, and infrastructure needs. They also provide a remediation checklist and establish a timeline for remediation activities.
 *  During the Remediation phase, Microsoft is available by phone to review the progress of remediation and assist with running tools to identify and remediate issues during the process.
 *  During the Enable phase, Microsoft evaluates the process, activates the tenant, and helps configure and validate the Microsoft 365 environment.

### Your responsibility

Even with the FastTrack service, your organization still has some responsibility for various aspects of the project, including information gathering. The following list identifies your minimum responsibilities:

 *  During the Initiation phase, you're responsible for defining the goals for your organization.
 *  During the Assessment phase, you're responsible for creating a support plan for migration and outlining successful scenarios for the organization.
 *  During the Remediation phase, you're responsible for completing the activities that are identified in the Assessment phase. Attending checkpoint meetings with Microsoft and your internal project team is also required.
 *  During the Enable phase, you should provide Microsoft with the access and permissions to help complete configuration changes, manage resources, and configure on-premises services, as necessary.
