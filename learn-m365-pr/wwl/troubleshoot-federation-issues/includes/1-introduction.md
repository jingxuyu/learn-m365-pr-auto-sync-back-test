You work for a large organization where employees in your organization have upgraded to Microsoft Teams. Some employees still use Skype for Business for their meetings and communication. Your organization has a program to migrate all users to Teams but until everyone has upgraded, you must manage issues that arise from using both systems.

In this module, we will discuss federation and interoperability between Teams and Skype for Business.

**Federation** is the term used for communicating with users outside of your organization using Skype for Business or Teams.  

**Interoperability** is the term used for communication between a Skype for Business user and a Teams user.

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand how to troubleshoot interoperability issues between Teams and Skype for Business, or Skype.
- Understand how to troubleshoot federation issues, including federation policies and domain lists.
