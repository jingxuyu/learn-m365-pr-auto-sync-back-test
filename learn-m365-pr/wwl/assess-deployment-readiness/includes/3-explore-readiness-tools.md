To ensure a successful and efficient Windows deployment, you need to understand where your current state is today, so that you can plan where you need to be after the deployment project. There are several tools available to help you assess and understand the current state of your environment, including identifying potential issues that could prevent successful deployments.

#### Microsoft Endpoint Manager

You can use the solutions in Endpoint Manager to maintain corporate compliance and control, while providing employees access to the devices and applications they need to be productive. Endpoint Manager provides key management capabilities in application delivery, desktop virtualization, device management, and security. Organizations leveraging Endpoint Manager can view reports and run queries on the assets it manages, including complete inventory of the OS, software, and hardware.

#### Desktop Analytics

Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service that collects application and hardware data from clients. It helps identify known issue apps based on data from multiple sources, and provided recommended remediation or testing information, based on data from developers and deployment data from other customers. It provides graphical representation of which devices are current and which need updates, and report on the health of devices as well.

Desktop Analytics also uses this information to help generate deployment plans. By assessing factors such as app compatibility, the importance of those apps and how widely they are used, and different hardware configurations, Desktop Analytics can quickly assemble a recommended group for pilot deployments. Desktop Analytics also uses Endpoint Configuration Manager to turn deployment plans into live deployments.

#### Endpoint Analytics

Endpoint analytics is a cloud-based service that provides insights for measuring how your organization is working and the quality of the experience you're delivering to your users. Endpoint Analytics provides Windows 11 hardware readiness reports in the Work from Anywhere report. This report shows which devices are capable of running Windows 11, and lists reasons for devices that do not meet Windows 11 readiness. While Endpoint Analytics can leverage devices that are managed in Configuration Manager and co-managed devices, unlike Desktop Analytics, Endpoint Analytics does not require Configuration Manager.
