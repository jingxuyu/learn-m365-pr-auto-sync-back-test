This module provided you with insight into how to implement your domain services, and specifically how to add a custom domain into Microsoft 365. Custom domains enable companies to have their own branding, such as @contoso.com, on emails and accounts. One advantage of this type of branding is that it enables customers to verify who is emailing them.

In this module, you learned about the key factors that must be planned for when adding a new domain in Microsoft 365. These factors, which can differ with the Microsoft 365 subscription you select, include the domain's DNS requirements, such as the DNS zones used in a custom domain and the DNS record requirements for the domain.

A publicly available DNS zone is critical during the Microsoft 365 deployment for organizations that want to use custom domains. In this module, you learned about the following two scenarios that organizations can choose from when planning DNS zones for custom domains:

 -  Internal DNS zones and external DNS zones have different names.
 -  Internal DNS zones and external DNS zones have the same name (referred to as Split brain DNS or "split DNS" for short).

This module concluded by reviewing the steps to be taken to add a new domain to Microsoft 365 using the Microsoft 365 admin center and DNS Manager.
