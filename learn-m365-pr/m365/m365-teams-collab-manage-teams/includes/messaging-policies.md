Messaging policies are used to control which chat and channel messaging features are available to users in Microsoft Teams. You can use the default policy that is created automatically, or create one or more custom messaging policies for people in your organization. After you create a policy, you can assign it to a user or group of users.

## Change or create a messaging policy for one or many users

You can manage messaging policies in the Teams admin center by signing in with administrator credentials and choosing **Messaging policies** in the left navigation pane.

- To edit the existing default messaging policy for your organization, you would select the default policy called **Global,** and then make your changes.
- To create a new custom messaging policy, you would:

1. Select **New policy.**
1. Give the new policy a name.
1. Turn on or off relevant settings.
1. Assign your policy to users.
1. Save the new policy.

NOTE
You can't delete a policy if users are assigned to it. You must first assign a different policy to all affected users before deleting the original policy.
