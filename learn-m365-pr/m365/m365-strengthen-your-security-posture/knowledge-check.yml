  questions:
  - content: "What permission do you need to be able to view threat and vulnerability-related information?"
    choices:
    - content: "View data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right! Use this permission to view data."
    - content: "Global administrator"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is a role and not a permission. The Global administrator is one of the most powerful roles. Don't use this role just to view information."
    - content: "Active remediation actions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite. While this permission lets you view information, it also enables users to take action. Don't use this permission just to view information. Only assign this permission to users who need to carry out actions on the portal."
  - content: "Which aggregate score indicates the general security configuration posture of the devices across your organization?"
    choices:
    - content: "Exposure score"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's not right. Exposure score indicates the device exposure to threats and vulnerabilities across your organization."
    - content: "Device tag value"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. The device tag value indicates how assets should be prioritized."
    - content: "Secure Score"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right! The higher your Secure Score, the more resilient your endpoints are to threats."
  - content: "Where can you find common vulnerabilities and exploits?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the software inventory pane."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The software inventory pane doesn't list all the common vulnerabilities and exploits."
    - content: "In the event timeline."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The event timeline pane doesn't list all the common vulnerabilities and exploits."
    - content: "In the weaknesses pane"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right! Use the weaknesses pane to view all of the common vulnerabilities and exploits across your endpoints."
  - content: "What can you do to address a zero-day vulnerability?"
    choices:
    - content: "Use the suggested workaround until a fix is available."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct! Workarounds will help you deal with the vulnerability until a fix is available."
    - content: "Use the zero-day tag to remove the vulnerability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Tagging doesn't remove the vulnerability."
    - content: "Use the EOS tag to remove the vulnerability"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That isn't right. Tagging doesn't remove the vulnerability."
