  questions:
  - content: "Contoso is planning to implement audio conferencing. As Contoso's Enterprise Administrator, Patti Fernandez doesn't want Contoso's users to have to remember a specific conference ID that's assigned to them when they create meeting requests. What type of conference ID should Patti assign to Contoso's users to satisfy this requirement?"
