Organizations of all types require a records-management solution to manage regulatory, legal, and business-critical records. Records management in Microsoft 365 helps an organization manage their legal obligations, demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increase efficiency through regular disposition of items no longer required to be retained, no longer of value, or no longer required for business purposes.

Now that you have completed this module, you should be able to:

- Discuss the records management solution and its benefits.
- List the customer scenarios the records management solution addresses.
- Describe the records management configuration process.
- Explain what users will experience when the solution is implemented.
