    choices:
    - content: "Startup Repair"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The Startup Repair tool in Windows RE provides a simple and effective way for you to resolve most common startup problems. Try again."
    - content: "System Image Recovery tool"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The System Image Recovery tool replaces your computer’s current operating system with a complete computer backup that you created previously, and which you stored as a system image. You can use this tool only if you have made a recovery drive of your computer. You should use this tool only if other methods of recovery are unsuccessful, because this recovery method is intrusive and overwrites everything on the computer."
    - content: "System Restore"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. System Restore doesn't replace the current operating system. Using System Restore doesn't affect user data. Try again."
  - content: "You added a new hard disk to your Windows computer and changed the logical drive numbering. You now want to use BCDEdit to modify the Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store to account for this change in logical drive numbering. What's the first thing you should do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Update the logical drive number parameters in the Boot.ini file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't need to modify the Boot.ini file. Windows replaced the boot.ini file with the BCD store. Try again."
    - content: "Make a complete image backup of all drives with BCD partitions on them"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Never use BCDEdit without first making a complete image backup of all drives with BCD partitions on them. It's also important that you build a recovery disk that you can boot from in the event your boot drive fails, following any changes you make to the BCD. If this happens, you can boot to the recovery disk and use it to restore the backup image that you first created. This will enable you to at least get your computer back up and running, even if it's with the pre-modified version of the BCD."
    - content: "Update the logical drive number parameters in the Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM) entries in the Windows operating system"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. You don't need to modify the NVRAM entries. Windows replaced NVRAM with the BCD store. Try again."
  - content: "A user reports a system failure with a computer. You need to return the computer to an earlier state without re-installing the operating system or causing data loss. Which of the Windows RE recovery tools can you use to achieve this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Reset this PC"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't a Windows RE recovery tool. Try again."
    - content: "System Restore"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. System Restore restores your computer to a previous point in time (restore point), so that it doesn't replace your computer's current operating system. System Restore also provides protection against accidental deletion of programs. When you add or remove programs, System Restore creates restore points, and keeps copies of application programs (file names with an .exe or .dll extension). If you accidentally delete an executable (.exe) file, you can use System Restore to recover the file by selecting a recent restore point prior to when you deleted the program."
    - content: "System Image Recovery"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The System Image Recovery tool replaces your computer’s current operating system with a complete computer backup that you created previously, and which you stored as a system image. Try again."
