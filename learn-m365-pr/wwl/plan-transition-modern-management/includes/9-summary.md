The transition to modern management is a journey, and an organization's existing infrastructure and goals will determine what steps are needed. Existing Configuration Manager customers can leverage Co-management to continue to use their existing investment, while migrating certain workloads to Microsoft Intune. While some customers may choose to, the goal doesn't have to be moving all workloads to cloud-based solutions. On-premises and cloud technologies each have their advantages, and administrators should choose which works best for them. As organizations transition to modern management, in addition to transitioning client management methods, administrators should also consider implementing solutions such as Known Folder Move to migrate user data files to the cloud.
