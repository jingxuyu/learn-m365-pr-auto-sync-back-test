Teams will face challenges as they work through the creation and use of OKRs.  As a coach, you can help them overcome those obstacles through by using a variety of unblocking tactics.   

As a reminder, OKR development is rarely completed in the first session. Follow up with teams shortly after the coaching sessions to meet one-on-one or provide asynchronous feedback and get clear on next steps.  

If teams are feeling stuck during the process, consider the following: 

- Embrace the silence, silence is okay and lets people have an opportunity to think.
- Invite people who haven't yet shared to give their input.  
- Monitor and use the chat to your advantage â€“ sometimes the best ideas are shared in the chat. 
- If a team is stuck on trying to find a baseline, create the baseline as your key result and set a target.  
- If all else fails, vote!
