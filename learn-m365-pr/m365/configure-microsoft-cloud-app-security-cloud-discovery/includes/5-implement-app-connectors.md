You can use Cloud App Security app connectors to enable better control and visibility of your organization’s cloud apps. Cloud App Security uses APIs provided by your cloud app provider to enable and manage connections to that provider’s apps. You can even connect to multiple instances of the same cloud app. For example, you might use Salesforce in two parts of your organization. Each instance is treated and managed separately by Cloud App Security.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This multi-instance app support does not include Microsoft Azure or Office 365.

## Overview

The following process describes how Cloud App Security uses app connectors. Cloud App Security:

1. Retrieves and save authentication permissions.
2. Requests the user list.
3. Periodically scans users, groups, activities, and files.

> [!TIP]
> For each app you want to connect to, we recommend that you create an admin service account for that purpose alone.

The following table describes the items you can enable through your app connector.

| Items                      | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Account  information       | Visibility  into users, accounts, profile information, status (suspended, active,  disabled) groups, and privileges |
| Audit trail                | Visibility  into user activities, admin activities, sign-in activities |
| Data scan                  | Scanning of  unstructured data using two processes -periodically (every 12 hours) and in  real-time scan (triggered each time a change is detected). |
| App  permissions           | Visibility  into issued tokens and their permissions         |
| Account  governance        | Ability to  suspend users, revoke passwords                  |
| Data  governance           | Ability to  quarantine files, including files in trash, and overwrite files |
| App  permission governance | Ability to  remove tokens                                    |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all apps that are connected will have all the governance actions.
