“Cloud-only” describes a situation where the service models you want to use (SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS) run strictly in the cloud; there’s no connection to existing on-premises-based systems. One of the advantages of using the cloud-only model is that you don’t have to worry about the infrastructure that the services run on. All the backend functionality is invisible to your users and your IT department.

For smaller companies like startups or non-profits that don’t have in-house IT resources and capital outlay to buy and maintain their own infrastructure, the cloud-only model can be a good choice. Note, however, that a cloud-only model can limit the amount of customization available, because your users and IT staff have no access to SaaS and PaaS-based services running on servers.
