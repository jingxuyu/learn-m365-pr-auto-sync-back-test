This module examined the Windows as a Service (WaaS) model that was introduced with Windows 10. This module reviewed the following features of the WaaS model:

 -  WaaS replaced the traditional deployment model and operating system release cycle of several years with a much faster cadence of six months.
 -  Although new Windows client versions are released twice per year, you don't need to upgrade your devices that often.
 -  Each Windows client version is supported for 18 months, and you must upgrade it during that time.
