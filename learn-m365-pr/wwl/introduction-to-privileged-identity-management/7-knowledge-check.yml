  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Lucerne Publishing, Patti Fernandez wants to reduce or eliminate standing admin access to privileged roles. What feature of Azure AD Privileged Identity Management should Patti employ to meet this requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Azure roles"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. These roles are linked to an Azure resource, resource group, subscription, or management group. They won't reduce or eliminate standing admin access to privileged roles."
    - content: "Elevate access to the User Access Administrator role in Azure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This role enables you to view all resources and assign access in any subscription or management group in the directory. It won't reduce or eliminate standing admin access to privileged roles."
    - content: "Eligible admins"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Eligible admins are users that need privileged access periodically, but not all-day, every day. The role is inactive until the user needs access. At that point, the user must complete an activation process and become an active admin for a predetermined amount of time. More organizations are choosing to use this approach to reduce or eliminate “standing admin access” to privileged roles."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, Inc., Holly Spencer wants to enable Microsoft Purview Privileged Access Management (PAM). After Holly enables PAM at Fabrikam, its users must request just-in-time access to complete elevated and privileged tasks through an approval workflow that is highly scoped and time-bound. This process gives Fabrikam's users just-enough-access to complete the task at hand, without risking exposure of sensitive data or critical configuration settings. How will this feature benefit Fabrikam?"
    choices:
    - content: "It can reduce legacy authentication workflows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This task is a step in preparing for passwordless authentication."
    - content: "It can operate with zero standing privileges"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. By enabling PAM in Microsoft 365, organizations can operate with zero standing privileges. This design provides a layer of defense against vulnerabilities arising because of such standing administrative access."
    - content: "It reduces or eliminates standing admin access to privileged roles"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This feature applies to eligible admins, which are users that need privileged access periodically, but not all-day, every day."
