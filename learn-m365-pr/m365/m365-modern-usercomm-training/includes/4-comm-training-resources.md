To help your business or organization assemble training and communications content, Microsoft provides numerous resources for your use.

-	[Microsoft FastTrack Resource Hub](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/resources) provides access to a comprehensive set of short, video-based training with step-by-step instructional guidance. There are hundreds of topics to choose from based on what’s important to your organization, such as creating more impactful content, sharing sites and content, transforming teamwork, and unlocking productivity with modern devices. 
-	For organizations using Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you may be eligible to receive help with driving user adoption via Microsoft’s [FastTrack for Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/microsoft-365) program. Representatives guide you through adoption best practices as you go through the Microsoft 365 rollout process of Windows, Office, and EMS.
-	[Microsoft’s IT Showcase](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/itshowcase) is another great resource for Windows 10 deployment related content. It includes timelines and schedules, digital promotion templates, email templates, and intranet content based on materials used for Microsoft’s own deployment of Windows 10, and it can be modified for any organization to use. 

You can fine-tune these components and services together during your pilot phase. As you start to understand what training materials work best for your users, which devices to target, and which devices or user groups to avoid or delay implementation for, you can begin to broaden the deployment in later phases using a data and experience-driven approach. As the pilot expands, it’s critical to document and share frequently asked questions and self-service content to help reduce support tickets and helpdesk activities.
