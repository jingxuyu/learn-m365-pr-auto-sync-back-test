Exchange Online is a messaging and collaboration platform that provides one location for composing, reading, and storing email, calendar, contact, and task information. You can access this information with Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Web Access, or Outlook Mobile. Exchange Online supports access from most mobile devices, including Android, iOS, and Windows 10 devices. Some features of Exchange Online include:

- **Mailboxes and online archives**. Individual users have their own mailboxes that they can use to store mail messages. In addition to the main mailbox, some plans include an online archive that provides additional storage.
- **Calendaring**. Each user has a calendar that they can use to track upcoming events. Users can use calendars when booking meetings to verify availability. Where appropriate, users can delegate access to their calendars to other users such as administrative assistants and teammates. 
- **View and edit Office attachments online**. When users receive Office attachments, they can view and edit them online in Outlook on the web. They do not require a locally installed version of Office.
- **Shared mailboxes and resources**. You can use shared mailboxes for groups of users that need to share information in a central mailbox. You can configure resources for meeting rooms and equipment to facilitate booking. 
- **Public folders**. Earlier versions of Microsoft Exchange Server relied on public folders for collaboration. This feature is still available in Exchange Online if required.
- **Message policy and compliance**. There are several message policy and compliance features in Exchange Online. These include retention policies, message encryption, eDiscovery, data loss prevention, and journaling. 
- **Antispam and anti-malware**. All Exchange Online subscriptions include Exchange Online Protection, which provides configurable antispam and anti-malware scanning.
- **Configurable mail flow**. To support specialized mail flow (hybrid, partner, or third-party service scenarios), you can create inbound and outbound connectors in Office 365. For example, you can create connectors that use additional security settings for mail flow with a business partner. 
- **Mobile and multiplatform access**. Users can access mailboxes and calendars from Outlook on either Windows or Mac clients by using Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) over HTTPS or Microsoft Graph. Exchange Web Services is still supported but if youâ€™re updating or creating an app, use Microsoft Graph instead. Outlook on the web supports accessing mailboxes and calendars from almost any platform. Mobile devices can access mailboxes and calendars by using Exchange ActiveSync.  
- **Hybrid deployment**. You can integrate Exchange Online with an on-premises Exchange Server organization by implementing a hybrid deployment. In a hybrid deployment, Exchange Online and the on-premises Exchange organization can share a single namespace for messaging. A hybrid deployment also supports calendar sharing and mailbox moves between Exchange Online and an on-premises Exchange server.
- **Migration tools**. Exchange Online includes tools to migrate from other on-premises Exchange Server servers to Exchange Online. There is also a tool to migrate from any Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) messaging service to Exchange Online.
