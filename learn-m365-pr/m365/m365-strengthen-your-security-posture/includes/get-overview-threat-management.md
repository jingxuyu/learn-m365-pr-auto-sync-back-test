As a member of the security team of your organization, you understand that you must have a healthy approach to security. This means that you want to be able to carry out the identification, assessment, and remediation of endpoint vulnerabilities and threats.

Here, you’ll learn about vulnerability management in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  

## What is threat and vulnerability management?

Threat and vulnerability management is a component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. It provides built-in tools and features that allow you to manage threats and vulnerabilities across your environments, because you’re able to:

- **Discover misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in real-time**
  - Onboarded devices automatically provide information about vulnerabilities and  misconfigurations. You can see security issues from the dashboard along with recommendations for remediation. You can take advantage of exposure score, which indicates device exposure to threats and vulnerabilities across your organization. And also Microsoft Secure Score for devices, which is an aggregate score that indicates the general security configuration state of the devices across your organization
  - Information on software across the organization, installations, patches, and uninstalls is readily available. You’ll receive reports of newly discovered vulnerabilities across apps, along with details on how to remediate them.

- **Intelligently prioritize vulnerabilities**
  - You can use risk-based prioritization. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on threat insights, breach likelihood, and asset value, enabling you to assess the true threats to your organization so that you can more quickly decide on the best way to mitigate threats. You can protect high-value assets by identifying and prioritizing devices with confidential data, business-critical apps, and devices used by high-value users.

- **Accelerate and simplify remediation**
  - You can request IT admins to remediate vulnerabilities from the  security recommendation pages in Microsoft Endpoint Manager. You can explore different kinds of mitigations, such as configuration changes to minimize the risks of software vulnerabilities.

You access threat and vulnerability management from the Microsoft 365 Defender portal:
