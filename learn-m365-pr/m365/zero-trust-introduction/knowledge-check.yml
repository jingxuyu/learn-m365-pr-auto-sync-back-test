  questions:
  - content: "Why is a Zero Trust security model considered critical for organizations?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Zero Trust approach requires organizations to verify and validate users and devices."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Zero Trust model works on the principles of verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach. The Zero Trust model asserts every request is a potential threat and must be verified."
    - content: "The Zero Trust model trusts users and devices within the corporate network."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The _traditional_ approach automatically trusts users and devices within the defined network perimeter."
    - content: "The Zero Trust model focuses on network security and protects network access with firewalls and VPNs."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The Zero Trust model advocates protection across all domains—identity, endpoints, applications, network, infrastructure, and data."
  - content: "Why is it important to implement the Zero Trust strategy across all domains—identity, endpoints, applications, network, infrastructure, and data?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Zero Trust strategy ensures all the processes and procedures are carried out manually across all domains"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. An effective Zero Trust strategy automates routine tasks across all domains and layers of defense to reduce the chances of human error."
    - content: "The Zero Trust strategy enhances user experience by trusting people within the organization and granting them complete access."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zero Trust enhances user experience by automating protection and security compliance, such as enforcing conditional access based on the principle of least privilege."
    - content: "The Zero Trust approach advocates protection across all domains as they could be vulnerable entry points for cybercriminals to exploit."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The Zero Trust strategy asserts that each of these areas maintain their own security and compliance posture."
  - content: "Zero Trust is based on the principles of verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach. What does the principle of 'assume breach' imply?"
    choices:
    - content: "This principle asserts that the users and devices within the organization can be trusted."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zero Trust asserts all users, within or outside the corporate network, must not be trusted."
    - content: "This principle assumes every request is a potential threat."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. It assumes that every request from a user or device to access your systems and data has come from a cybercriminal."
    - content: "This principle assumes that every request that originates from outside the network is a potential threat."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Zero Trust assumes that there's no defined network and treats _every_ request as a potential threat."
