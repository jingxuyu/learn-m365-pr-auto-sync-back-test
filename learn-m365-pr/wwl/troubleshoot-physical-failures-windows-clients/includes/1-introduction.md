Hardware failures can be catastrophic unless you plan for them, as well as for data redundancy and regular backups. You should have procedures in place so that you can troubleshoot failed devices efficiently, particularly for your most vulnerable devices such as hard disk drives and memory. You should also know the SLA that your company has with respect to device failures, and your organization’s procedure for replacing hardware components. If the failed component includes data, such as a hard disk drive, you might have a special their process for discarding these devices to protect the stored data’s confidentiality.

While this module doesn't go extensively into all the different troubleshooting methods for all the various hardware components, this module provides an overview of the common hardware issues that can be expected.

#### Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Apply device-replacement considerations.
 -  Identify the most vulnerable hardware devices.
 -  Apply the guidelines for replacing hardware.
 -  Diagnose memory problems.
 -  Diagnose and troubleshoot disk problems.
