Ransomware has now developed into a complete business model called Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) where cyber criminals license out "off the shelf" products. These products share common characteristics just as a family would, which makes that recognizable. In September 2021, in an analysis of over 12.7 million malware detections made by a key antivirus company, over 220 ransomware families were identified.

The top 10 families will change, but some notable ones are:

- WannaCryptor
- Stop/DJVU
- Conti
- REvil

### WannaCryptor

The following key facts are known about WannaCryptor:

- It targets Windows Operating machines.
- It demands payment via Bitcoin.
- It relies on vulnerabilities in the system to gain access to the system.
- It's known as a crypto worm, as once inside a system, it can spread by itself.
- In 2017, it was part of a global attack that brought disruption to over 185,000 machines across 100 countries.
- It's also known as Wannacrypt, Wanna Decryptor, Wana Decrypt0r 2.0, and  WanaCrypt0r 2.0
- It's believed to originate in North Korea.

### Stop/DJVU

The following key facts are known about Stop/DJVU:

- It's introduced onto a system via spam email or takes advantage of software vulnerabilities.
- Once on the machine, it will run a file, which loads the software onto your machine, which targets documents, spreadsheets, images, videos and databases and other similar data. It then blocks access to the files and demands a ransom.
- It's also known as STOP Ransomware, STOP (DJVU), or DJVU virus and has a total of 374 active variants.
- It mainly targets Windows operating systems.
- It's extremely difficult to decrypt files infected with this ransomware.
- It isn't known which country or countries the cybercriminals work from.

### Conti

The following key facts are known about Conti:

- Its main target is hospitals and healthcare organizations.
- It targets files vital for the running of the organization putting lives at risk while the systems are down.
- The average ransom is $850,000.
- As well as the installation of the ransomware, it also installs other malware to steal data.
- The ransom for stolen data can sometimes be more than the original data.
- The virus enters the system via phishing emails with attachments. When the attachment is opened, the virus runs and encrypts the system.

### REvil

The following key facts are known about the group

- REvil are a group of ransomware hackers also known by the name Sodinokibi.
- It's understood that most of its members are Russian or from former Soviet Union countries.
- The ransom demands have been getting increasingly larger as they become more targeted in their approach.
- They have made announcements that the agricultural sector is going to be a major target for this group.
- They often threaten to auction off data if ransom demands aren't met.
- REvil operate under a licensing model (Ransomware as a Service).
- They threaten to post sensitive documents on its website known by the name “Happy Blog” if demands aren't met.
- They were linked to over 24 local governments attacks in Texas in 2019.
- Despite a high-profile announcement that agencies in Russia had shut down the group, there are still reports of attacks using that name.

High profile attacks appear in the media and in 2021 there were two very high-profile attacks by two ransomware families called REvil and DarkSide.

## Case Study 1 – Meat Processing Company

The following outlines the attack:

- **The target** was a major US meat packing corporation in June 2021.
- **The attackers**, a group called REvil downloaded malicious code that affected operations in Australia and North America and was described as very sophisticated.
- **The impact** on the company involved halting all cattle slaughtering in all US plants and suspending food production in Australia and North America.
- **To resolve the situation** the company paid a ransom using Bitcoin for $11M, stating they had done so to protect customers.

The government response:

- The scale of the attack prompted the United States to act and offer a reward of up to $10M for any information that would lead to the gang members.
- In an act of cooperation, the Russian intelligence bureau arrested the group and seized more than $560,000 worth of crypto currency and over 20 premium cars bought with the “proceeds of crime”.
- The ransomware did disappear for a while but has since re-emerged and once again is a major threat.

## Case Study 2 – Major Fuel Distribution Company

The following outlines the attack:

- **The target** was a major oil distribution plant in April 2021.
- **The attackers**, a group called Darkside, downloaded malicious code onto the company’s network that affected the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.
- **The impact** of the attack hit companies and drivers as fuel deliveries were halted leading to panic buying throughout the affected area.
- **To resolve the situation** the fuel distribution company paid a ransom of $4.4M using Bitcoin, stating at the time that they didn't know the extent of the intrusion or how long it would take to restore operations.

The government response:

US investigators recovered millions in crypto currency as they targeted DarkSide the company responsible for the attack. It later was revealed that DarkSide had been under surveillance for over a year and the fuel distribution company had been following the investigators instructions so they could track the ransom payment to a cryptocurrency wallet used by the hackers. Despite this success, the Darkside ransomware is still active and affecting other users.
