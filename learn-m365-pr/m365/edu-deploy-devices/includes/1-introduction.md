The school classroom has evolved from the traditional dusty chalkboard with the teacher speaking to their students, to a more engaged and interactive experience where students use tablets and computers to enhance their day-to-day learning.

Since 2017, Microsoft has been working with and supporting the school IT departments, faculties, and students to provide a richer learning experience.

Suppose you work in your school's IT department. The school has recently migrated to Azure and wants to use the educational capabilities offered by Microsoft. You want to look at how your team can enable the teachers and students to seamlessly use technology in the classroom without creating a burden on the IT department.

In this module, you'll explore different technology options offered by Microsoft, including the *Set up School PCs* app and *Windows Autopilot*. You'll learn how to configure and enroll devices for use in the classroom through the use of provisioning packages. Also, you'll learn how to automate deployment across the school using Windows Autopilot. Finally, you'll see how to enable automatic enrollment for iOS devices.

## Learning Objective

1. Select the right deployment options for your school, using either the Set up School PCs app or Windows Autopilot.
