  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "When administrators configure record declaration settings at the site collection level, they must select the option that specifies the kind of restrictions that will be placed on an item when it's declared a record. Which option displays a “padlock” icon next to the document?"
    choices:
    - content: "No Additional Restrictions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This restriction is useful if you want records to have a retention policy that's separate from active documents, but you don’t want to block the records from being deleted or edited. This option doesn't display a padlock icon next to the document. Try again."
    - content: "Block Delete"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This restriction allows records to be edited but not deleted. This option doesn't display a padlock icon next to the document. Try again."
    - content: "Block Edit and Delete"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This restriction is useful if you want to completely lock a document so that it can't be edited or deleted. A “padlock” icon is associated with the document to visually show that the item is locked. This option is the default setting."
