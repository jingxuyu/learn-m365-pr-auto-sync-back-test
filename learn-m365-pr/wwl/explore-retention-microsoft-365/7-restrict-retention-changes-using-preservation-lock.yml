    - content: "Only a Global administrator can make a locked retention policy less restrictive"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With preservation lock, you can lock the policy so that no one, including the global administrator, can make it less restrictive."
    - content: "The preservation lock can never be removed from a retention policy once it's been applied"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Preservation Lock locks a retention policy or retention label policy so that no one—not even an administrator—can turn off the policy, delete the policy, or make it less restrictive."
