Managing Cloud PCs is just like managing any other device. You apply configuration profiles and assign apps. You apply quality and feature updates using update rings. You apply security policies in the same manor as physical devices. While you might specify separate policies just for Cloud PCs, the method is no different.

### Remote actions

Most of the same remote actions available on physical devices, are available for Cloud PCs as well. They include:

 -  Restart
 -  Sync
 -  Rename
 -  Quick Scan
 -  Full Scan
 -  Update Windows Defender

There are three remote actions that are unique to Cloud PCs and will be available if a Cloud PC is selected.

 -  Reprovisioning
 -  Resize
 -  Collect diagnostics
### Reprovisioning

The Reprovision remote action lets admins reprovision Cloud PCs. When a reprovision is triggered, the Cloud PC will be deleted and recreated as a new Cloud PC. All user data, applications, customizations, and the like will be deleted.

 -  You're testing different Cloud PC configurations.
 -  Your provisioned Cloud PC is misbehaving.
 -  The user simply wants to start from a fresh Cloud PC.

To reprovision a Cloud PC, perform the following steps:

1.  Sign in to the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**, select **Devices** > **All Devices** > choose a Cloud PC device > **Reprovision**.

2.  In the Reprovision box, select **Yes**. The reprovision process will begin.

3.  After the new Cloud PC is created, Windows 365 sends access information to the new user.

### Resize a Cloud PC

The Resize remote action lets you upgrade a Cloud PC’s RAM, CPU, and storage size. This is useful if the requirements of a user change over time, such as running more CPU intensive applications or need more disk storage. When choosing an initial size, keep in mind that resizing only allows increasing storage; you won't be able to resize to a lower storage allocation.

To resize a Cloud PC, the following are required:

 -  The admin must have either Global Admin or the Intune Service Admin Azure AD role
 -  The Cloud PC must have a status of provisioned.
 -  The user must be signed out with all work saved as resizing disconnects their session.

Resizing a Cloud PC involves the following steps:

1.  Sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, select **Devices** > **All Devices** > choose a device > **Resize**.
    
    :::image type="content" source="../media/resize-6b7faa89.png" alt-text="Screenshot of resize a Cloud PC.":::
    
2.  You’ll see a list with all the possible SKUs that you can upgrade to. You increase and decrease a Cloud PC’s specs (RAM/vCPU). You can only increase the OS disk storage. You can't decrease the OS disk storage. If you're downsizing a user’s Cloud PC, options with lower storage will be grayed out. Select one of the available options.
3.  Select **Resize**. 
-  When triggering a resize, the Cloud PC will be rebooted and the user will be immediately disconnected from their current session. Make sure the user saves all their work to avoid any potential data loss.
-  If there are available licenses, the upgrade/downgrade will take place.
-  If you have a combination of paid and trial licenses, the resize feature will use your paid licenses first. After these licenses run out, the resize operation will use your trial licenses.
-  If there are no licenses in your inventory, the resizing will fail. You can contact your procurement admin to request more licenses. After the license has been purchased and added to the inventory in the Microsoft Admin Center, you can retry the resize operation.
