**Security posture assessment**. Microsoft 365 provides a view of your security posture with Secure Score. For your Microsoft 365 users, identities, apps, and devices, you can see scores that represent your overall security posture along with recommendations for how you can improve. For example, you might have some misconfigured devices and arenâ€™t protected by Windows Defender ATP. Secure Score will highlight these devices so you can quickly follow up and fix the issue. Customers are encouraged to complete an initial assessment to determine if they have plans for recommended actions, and then track over time their posture to ensure continued improvements are measured.

**SIEM integration.** Many Microsoft 365 security solutions provide SIEM integration, helping security teams source together signals and information across their network. This helps security teams review, analyze, and respond to security alerts.
