In this module, you learned fundamental concepts about Office Add-ins.

- Office Add-ins extend the functionality of Office applications.
- Task pane and content add-ins are two of the ways to integrate with an Office application.
- Dialogs enable authentication scenarios and provide additional space for displaying content.
- Custom functions are your own defined JavaScript or TypeScript functions that users can access like built-in functions in Excel.
- Add-in commands are UI elements that extend the Office UI, such as buttons on the ribbon or items in a context menu.
- An add-in's manifest file specifies metadata about the add-in and describes how the add-in integrates with Office.
