    choices:
    - content: "A cutover migration migrates Outlook Cached-Mode OST files"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Outlook Cached-Mode OST files aren't migrated in a cutover migration. Try again."
    - content: "Unified messaging must be enabled on the mailboxes before you migrate them"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. If the mailboxes you're migrating are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM), you must disable UM on the mailboxes before you migrate them. You can enable UM on the mailboxes after the migration is complete. Try again."
    - content: "A cutover migration doesn't migrate security groups and system mailboxes"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. A cutover migration only moves mailboxes, mail users, mail contacts, and mail-enabled groups. Security Groups and system mailboxes aren't migrated."
