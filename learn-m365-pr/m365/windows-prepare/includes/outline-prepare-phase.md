You’ve successfully guided Woodgrove through the Plan phase of the servicing process. As the process manager, you’ve decided to put together a high-level overview of the kind of work that will need to be carried out to prepare the environment, so that you can use it to explain to the team what they will do at this stage.

## Dependencies

The Plan phase helped Woodgrove to create the following outputs:
-   Compatibility criteria defined in the Plan phase
-   Application prioritization list
-   Infrastructure and configuration remediation list
-   Operations update plan

These artifacts help you address different parts of Woodgrove’s environment. Woodgrove will take advantage of these artifacts to ensure its environment is prepared for the Windows 10 feature update.

## Decisions and tasks

You outline the following high-level decisions and tasks to be implemented across each workstream, to prepare the environment and ensure readiness for the feature update:

|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|***Infrastructure***|Review all of the approved infrastructure changes.|Validate all the changes.|Implement all the changes.|Agree that deployment readiness criteria have been met (pass or fail).|
|***Configuration***|Review new security settings.|Review security baselines for changes.|Implement and validate security settings and baseline changes.|Create a security and settings baseline file.|

|***Capability***|Enable changes|Validate changes|Remediate potential issues|Create communication schedule for the feature update
|***Modernization Example:***|Set up Desktop Analytics|Enroll devices|Create deployment plans|Deploy to pilot|

## Desktop Analytics

As part of their modernization activity to reduce the effort for Windows 10 feature updates, Woodgrove decides to take advantage of Desktop Analytics to reduce the time and effort it takes to validate applications and devices in their environment. Desktop Analytics is a service that runs in the cloud and collaborates with your on-premises Configuration Manager. As the process manager, you understand that the service will help Woodgrove make better-informed choices on how to achieve readiness for each Windows 10 feature updates it plans to deploy to its environment.

## Responsibilities

There are many tasks that Woodgrove will carry out to prepare its environment for the feature update. As the process manager, you underline that it is important that all stakeholders in the process communicate effectively. Ensuring that they remain informed and understand their responsibilities throughout the process will reduce confusion and help Woodgrove get to Pilot deployment  quicker.

You explain that your role as the process manager means you will work with all the stakeholders involved to delegate responsibilities across teams. You also highlight that when assigning responsibilities representatives from all stakeholders will be pulled in to ensure that tasks are delegated to the most appropriate roles and that they are also aware of the work that will be carried out throughout the process.
