## Azure Active Directory Identity Protection 
Azure Active Directory Identity Protection is a feature of the Azure AD Premium P2 edition that helps you:

- Detect potential vulnerabilities affecting your organization’s identities
- Configure automated responses to detected suspicious actions that are related to your organization’s identities 
- Investigate suspicious incidents and take appropriate action to resolve them 

Azure Active Directory uses adaptive machine learning algorithms and heuristics to detect anomalies and suspicious incidents that indicate potentially compromised identities. Using this data, Identity Protection generates reports and alerts that enable you to evaluate the detected issues and take appropriate mitigation or remediation actions.

Azure Active Directory Identity Protection is more than a monitoring and reporting tool. To protect your organization's identities, you can configure risk-based policies that automatically respond to detected issues when a specified risk level has been reached. These policies, in addition to other conditional access controls provided by Azure Active Directory and EMS, can either automatically block or initiate adaptive remediation actions including password resets and multi-factor authentication enforcement.

## Azure Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

## Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection
Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection. Because email provides a primary means for introducing malware into an organization, advanced threat protection aims to identify the threats before they land in a user’s mailbox. This feature is included in Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions, and provides protection by:
- Scanning email attachments for malware. 
- Scanning URLs in email messages and Microsoft Office documents. 
- Identifying and blocking malicious files found in online libraries, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams.
- Checking email messages for unauthorized spoofing. 
- Detecting when someone attempts to impersonate your users and access your organization's custom domains. 

## Office 365 Threat Intelligence
Office 365 Threat Intelligence helps security analysts and administrators protect their organization's Office 365 users by:
- Making it easy to identify, monitor and understand attacks
- Helping to quickly address threats in Exchange Online and SharePoint Online

## Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) help security teams to prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. Windows Defender ATP uses technologies built into Windows 10 that connect to Microsoft's robust cloud services:
- Endpoint behavioral sensors: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and sends this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Windows Defender ATP.
- Cloud security analytics: Leveraging big-data, machine-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.
- Threat intelligence: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Windows Defender ATP to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these are observed in collected sensor data.

## Windows 10
Windows 10 has more built-in security protections to help safeguard you against viruses, phishing, and malware, it’s the most secure Windows ever. Hardware and software security features such as BitLocker and credential guard help protect the integrity of the boot process and user credentials. Windows Hello helps strengthen authentication and helps to guard against potential spoofing through fingerprint matching and facial recognition. Windows Information Protection (WIP) helps protect against potential data leakage without interfering with the employee experience. Included with Windows 10, WIP also helps to protect enterprise apps and data against accidental data leak on enterprise-owned devices and personal devices that employees bring to work without requiring changes to your environment or other apps. In addition, Azure Rights Management works alongside WIP to extend data protection for data that leaves the device, such as when email attachments are sent from an enterprise aware version of a rights management mail client.
