As the Microsoft Teams administrator for your organization, you want to ensure meetings and calls are inclusive of users with disabilities so everyone can participate and contribute.

You can take advantage of several features, including captions and transcription, to support accessibility in your Teams environment.

Here, you will learn how to enable features like captions and transcripts to help make meetings and calls more inclusive of people with disabilities.

## Why captions and transcripts are important

Captions and transcripts are text versions of the words someone is speaking. Captions and transcripts provide people who are hard of hearing, people with learning disabilities like dyslexia, and many others the option to see text in addition to, or instead of, only audio. Captions also may benefit people who are deaf by providing additional information on top of what those users receive from the sign language interpreter they may work with.

*Captions* appear for users in sync with real-time audio without obstructing other visual aids, like shared screens or media, as shown in the image below.

*Transcripts* play for users in sync with audio for recorded meetings. Users can access transcripts separately from videos so they can digest the content in a manner they prefer:

## Enable live captions for meetings

Live captions are managed through policies. You can configure live caption policies by using either the Microsoft Teams admin center.

To enable live captions for all users using the Microsoft Teams admin center:

1. Select **Meeting policies**.
1. Select the **Global (Org-wide default) policy**.
1. Then set **Enable live captions** to **Disabled, but the user can override** in your policy, as indicated in the image.

Users can then turn on live captions during meetings:

> Live captions are currently available for meetings held in Commercial, and Government Community Cloud (GCC) tenants.

### Data handling

To provide live captions for meetings, Microsoft Teams leverages details like the meeting subject, attachments, invitation, and recent emails of participants. Data handling adheres to the terms of your master service agreement with Microsoft. Microsoft Teams protects data associated with live captions by taking several measures:

- Data is only processed in the geographical region where your organization is based.
- Data is processed automatically through Microsoft Automatic Speech Recognition service, which means no one has access to the meeting audio or any other data associated with the meeting.
- All caption data generated is permanently deleted after a meeting ends.
- The user can easily disable and re-enable live captions when necessary.
