You need to understand both Phone System and Microsoft Teams add-on licenses.

1. If the Phone System feature isn't included in your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 plan, you may need to purchase Phone System add-on licenses. After you have Phone System licenses, purchase Calling Plans for Microsoft 365 or Office 365.

1. First assign the licenses, and then assign a Calling Plan to the people in your organization. For licensing requirements see **Microsoft Teams add-on licenses** below.

  > [!TIP]
  > **Phone System** licenses and Calling Plans in Microsoft 365 or Office 365 go together, so to see the option to purchase Calling Plans, you must first have the **Phone System** licenses.

### Microsoft Teams add-on licenses

#### What are add-on licenses

Add-on licenses are licenses for specific Microsoft Teams features. They give you the flexibility to add features only for users in your organization who need them. To add a feature, buy one add-on license for each user who will use it.
For a complete list of the features you can get with add-on licenses, see the **What features can I get with add-on licenses** in the **Microsoft Teams add-on licenses** site in the **Additional resources** section in the Summary.
