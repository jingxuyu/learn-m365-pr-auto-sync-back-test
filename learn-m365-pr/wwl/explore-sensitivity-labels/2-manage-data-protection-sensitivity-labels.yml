  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Organizations can tie sensitivity labels with other actions on a document. For example, an organization can configure a label, such as a \"Highly Confidential\" label, so that it encrypts the data in whatever document or email that it's applied to. When a document is encrypted, what other effect can encryption have on the document?"

    - content: "It causes a watermark to be automatically displayed on the content"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't the effect that encryption can have on a document."
    - content: "It can restrict what actions authorized people can take on the content"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Encryption can also restrict what actions authorized people can take on the content."
    - content: "It automatically prohibits the document from being sent in emails"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't the effect that encryption can have on a document."
