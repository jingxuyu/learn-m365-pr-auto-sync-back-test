## Outline the units

1. **Introduction**

    You work for Woodgrove, a large financial organization. Your company's technical director shared a report about their internal IT infrastructure. The report reveals that, although your company's production environment runs on Windows 10, 20 percent of Windows 10 devices have reached, or are nearing, end of service. 
    
    As a result, some devices that have critical business functions aren't receiving security updates, and are at greater risk of obtaining viruses and malware. Also, these devices might miss important feature updates to build on productivity across the organization. You've been asked to present a plan for how your company can stay current with the latest Windows updates from Microsoft.

1. **Overview**

    - Why your organization needs to stay current:
        - Secure your organization’s data, applications, devices and identities
        - Improved productivity
        - Take advantage of latest feature improvements across Windows and Office.
        
    - How can your organization stay current?
        - Explain the Servicing Framework
            - Use the framework diagram to explain the process end-to-end.
                - Mention that Woodgrove can use can cloud management with Windows Update for Business to make it much easier to stay current.
    - How to accelerate the stay current process
        - Desktop Analytics - Briefly describe how Desktop Analytics can help Woodgrove to stay current.
    - Knowledge Check

1. **Technology primer**

    - Explain App classification
        - Critical
        - Important
        - Not important
    
    - Servicing Channels - Windows & Office
        - Explain servicing channels
    
    - Supportability
    
    - Knowledge Check

1. **Roles and responsibilities in the stay current process**

    - Who is involved in the stay current process?
        - Describe the following roles, explaining their responsibilities/skills:
            - Process Manager
            - Application Owner
            - End-User Computing
            - Security
            - Operations
    
    - Who should lead the stay current process?
        - It’s recommended that Woodgrove identify a Process Owner. They will oversee, and are informed of, most of the tasks undertaken by everyone else during the process. They are also in charge of, and responsible for:
            - Reporting remediation outcomes
            - Escalating failures
            - Determining whether the environment is ready for targeted deployment at the end of the prepare phase. And then broad deployment after the target deployment phase.
