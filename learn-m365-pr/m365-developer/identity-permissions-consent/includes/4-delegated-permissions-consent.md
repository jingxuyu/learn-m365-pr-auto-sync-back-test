Delegated permissions are permissions granted by a user or administrator to an app to allow the app to act on behalf of the signed in user.

In this unit, youâ€™ll learn about delegated permissions and how to define them in app registrations with either static or dynamic consent.

## Delegated permissions

Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests, and the app is delegated permission to act as the signed-in user when making calls to the target resource. Some delegated permissions can be consented to by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.

For example, a user can grant an app the delegated permissions **User.Read**, that enables the user of the app to sign in and read the user's profile, and **User.ReadBasic.All**, that allows the user of the app to read basic profile information about all users in the organization. The **User.Read.All** permission that allows the user of the app to read the full profile information of all user's in the organization may only be granted by an admin in most cases.

## User consent

If the user hasn't previously granted the permission to the app or an administrator hasn't consented on behalf of all users in the organization, when a user signs-in to an app, they're shown a consent prompt.

When the user selects the **Accept** button, the consent settings are saved and the user won't be prompted again.

There are two ways to define the permissions an app needs that drives what permissions are listed in the consent prompt. These two approaches are called static and dynamic consent.

## Static consent

With static consent, all the permissions the app will ever require are defined in the app's registration within the Azure AD admin center.

The static consent approach is how the Microsoft identity v1.0 authorize endpoint worked. All permissions an application used needed to be defined ahead of time. When users signed in, they would have to consent to all permission requests.

This approach also enables administrators to consent on behalf of all users in the organization.

## Dynamic consent

The other option to static consent is dynamic consent. This was introduced in the Microsoft identity v2.0 endpoint. With this option, not all permissions need to be specified in the app registration in the Azure AD admin center.

Each time the app requests an access token, it specifies the permissions it needs in the `scope` property. If the user hasn't already consented to those permissions, they'll go through the consent experience for the additional permissions.

Dynamic consent enables developers to only ask users for the permissions the app needs at that time. For example, at sign-in the app can request minimal profile information, but later request additional permissions to do more advanced tasks.
