Resources are navigational links that you set up in [SharePoint global
navigation](/viva/connections/sharepoint-app-bar).
You must first enable global navigation for Resources to display in the
Viva Connections experience. On the mobile experience, Resources
displays as its own tab. One the desktop and web experiences, Resources
can be accessed by selecting your organization’s Viva Connections icon
twice from the Teams app bar.

Links in Resources should help address opportunities that are identified in the
needs assessment from [module 2](/training/modules/viva-connections-plan). These links often point to
organizational information that everyone can benefit from, such as
trainings resources, event opportunities, and the HR portal. Links can
also be targeted to specific audiences to personalize the experience for
certain roles and regions.

### Learn how Lamna Healthcare sets up SharePoint global navigation

As the Internal Communications Manager, you work with Lamna
Healthcare’s planning team for Viva Connections to conduct a needs
assessment in the planning phase. The needs assessment helps surface
popular requests, pain points, opportunities to boost productivity, and
improve wellness in the workplace. The planning team organizes and
synthesizes insights from the needs assessment and prioritizes where
content should be located throughout the three components of the Viva
Connections experience. The planning team decides to use links in
SharePoint global navigation to make it easy to access the most popular
portals. Some of the popular portals include required training, information about pay and benefits, upcoming events, and information about people and
facilities.
