  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer is planning the company's Exchange hybrid deployment. Fabrikam uses self-signed certificates for its Exchange Servers. How does this scenario affect the type of hybrid deployment that Holly can install?"
    choices:
    - content: "Fabrikam must use Exchange Classic Hybrid"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Exchange Classic Hybrid doesn't support self-signed certificates. Try again."
    - content: "Fabrikam must install Trusted Digital Certificates for HTTPS services"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. If you plan to implement Exchange Classic Hybrid for an Exchange Modern Hybrid deployment, you must install Digital Certificates for HTTPS services that you purchase from a trusted public certification authority (CA). However, Fabrikam wants to use self-signed certificates. Try again."
    - content: "Fabrikam must use Exchange Modern Hybrid"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. If you use self-signed certificates for Exchange Servers, you must use Exchange Modern Hybrid because Exchange Classic Hybrid doesn't support self-signed certificates."
