A tenant is a term used for a Microsoft 365 organization. It's a dedicated instance of the Microsoft 365 service that an organization receives and owns when it creates a relationship with Microsoft. Each Microsoft 365 tenant is unique and separate from other Microsoft 365 tenants. For example, a tenant name can't be changed, so organizations must ensure they choose their name wisely.

A tenant stores the users in a company and the information about them. The data that it stores for each user account includes the user password, user profile data, permissions, and so on. It also contains groups, applications, and other information related to an organization and its security.
