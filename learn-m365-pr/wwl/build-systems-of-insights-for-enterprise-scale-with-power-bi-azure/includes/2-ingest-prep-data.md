In the modern BI world, data preparation is considered the most difficult, expensive, and time-consuming task, estimated by experts as taking 60%-80% of the time and cost of a typical analytics project. Some of the challenges in those projects include fragmented and incomplete data, complex system integration, business data without any structural consistency, and of course, a high skillset barrier.

To answer many of these challenges, Power BI serves analysts today with industry-leading data preparation capabilities using Power Query in Power BI Desktop. With Power BI dataflows, we’re bringing these self-service data preparation capabilities into the Power BI online service, and significantly expanding the capabilities in the following ways:

- **Self-service data prep for big data in Power BI** – Dataflows can be used to easily ingest, cleanse, transform, integrate, enrich, and schematize data from a large array of transactional and observational sources, encompassing all data preparation logic. Business analysts and BI professionals can use dataflows to handle the most complex data preparation challenges and build on each other’s work, thanks to a revolutionary model-driven calculation engine, which takes care of all the transformation and dependency logic.

- **Advanced Analytics and AI with Azure** – Power BI dataflows store data in [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/data-lake-storage/introduction) – which means that data ingested through a Power BI dataflow is now available to data engineers and data scientists to leverage the full power of Azure Data Services such as Azure Machine Learning, Azure Databricks, and Azure SQL Data warehouse for advanced analytics and AI. This allows business analysts, data engineers, and data scientists to collaborate on the same data within their organization.

- **Support for the [Common Data Model](https://aka.ms/AA24r2z)** – The Common Data Model (CDM) is a set of a standardized data schemas and a metadata system to allow consistency of data and its meaning across applications and business processes.  Dataflows support the CDM by offering easy mapping from any data in any shape into the standard CDM entities, such as Account, Contact etc.

- **Visual data preparation** – We are introducing “Diagram View” within the Power Query Editor, that provides an interface to easily create your queries and visualize your data preparation process. We want to simplify the experience for analysts to get started, speed up the data preparation process, and help quickly understand the data flow, both the ‘big picture view’ of how the queries are related and the ‘detailed view’ around specific data preparation steps within a query.
