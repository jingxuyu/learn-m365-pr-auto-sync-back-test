quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which dDiscovery capability helps organizations manage the people they've identified as people of interest in a case?"
    choices:
    - content: "Custodian management"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Custodian management is managing the people that you've identified as people of interest in a case (called custodians) and other data sources that may not be associated with a custodian. When you add custodians and non-custodial data sources to a case, you can place a legal hold on these data sources, communicate with custodians by using the legal hold notification process, and search custodian and non-custodial data sources to collect content relevant to the case."
    - content: "Case management"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Case management associates specific searches and exports with a specific investigation. You can also assign members to a case to control who can access the case and view the contents of the case."
    - content: "Tagging"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Tagging helps organizations remove non-relevant content and identify the most relevant content."
