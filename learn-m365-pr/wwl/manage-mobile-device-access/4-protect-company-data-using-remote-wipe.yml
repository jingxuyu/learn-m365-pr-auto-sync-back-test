quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging admin for Contoso, Holly Dickson plans to do a Remote Wipe on a device that supports a strong encryption of all device data. What should Holly be aware of in this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "After completing the remote wipe, Holly may still be able to retrieve data using special forensic investigation tools"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Data recovery using sophisticated forensic investigation tools is only possible if the device isn't encrypted. Try again."
    - content: "The remote wipe will destroy all data on the device except for photos"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. By default, Remote Wipe destroys all data on the device, including personal photos and data. Try again."
    - content: "Data recovery on the device will be difficult, if not impossible"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After a remote device wipe, data recovery is difficult, if not impossible. This situation is especially true when the device supports a strong encryption of all device data."
