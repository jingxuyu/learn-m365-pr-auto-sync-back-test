  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Northwind Traders, you implemented Office Telemetry. Northwind is running Office 2016, and all users are running Windows 8 on their desktops. You're especially interested in the Telemetry data that's collected for the night shift. This shift has had performance issues over the past several months, and you're interested in tracking their Office usage. When you went live, you checked your computers for the data that had been reported after the night shift. To your surprise, no night shift data appeared. What was the probable cause for this lack of data?"
    choices:
    - content: "You didn't deploy Telemetry Agents"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Office 2013 and Office 2016 have agents automatically installed. You only need to deploy Telemetry Agents for Office versions prior to Office 2013. Try again."
    - content: "Given the eight-hour data collection interval, it may take some time before all computers are reporting data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Data reporting is a background activity. After the random initial upload interval, Office Telemetry collects data only every eight hours."
    - content: "Windows 8 computers don't support the Office Telemetry Agent scheduled task"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Windows XP computers don't support the Telemetry Agent, but Windows 8 computers do. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, you're considering implementing Office Telemetry. As you plan your implementation, what is the minimum amount of free space for temporary storage that you should have available on all computers with installed Telemetry Agents?"
    choices:
    - content: "6 GB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the minimum amount of free space that should be available on all computers with installed Telemetry Agents. Try again."
    - content: "11 GB"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Even with small upload sizes, significant data collections can result in larger organizations. Make sure that all computers with installed agents have at least 11 GB of free space for temporary storage of data."
    - content: "20 GB"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the minimum amount of free space that should be available on all computers with installed Telemetry Agents. Try again."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, you're considering implementing Office Telemetry. As you plan your implementation, what step should you complete during the Office Telemetry installation once you've prepared the database?"
    choices:
    - content: "Connect the dashboard to the database"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This step creates and populates other worksheets. It's also required to enable viewing of the data. However, this item isn't the step that should be performed after preparing the database. Try again."
    - content: "Configure required privacy settings"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't the step that should be performed after preparing the database. In fact, this is the final configuration step. By default, data collection includes full file names, file paths, and document titles. However, if you complete this step, you can obscure this information if you don't want to make it available for some of your administrators. Try again."
    - content: "Set up the Office Telemetry Processor"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. After preparing the database, the next step is to set up the Office Telemetry Processor. The processor reads information that Office Telemetry Agents store in the shared folder. It then connects and adds records to the Office Telemetry database."
