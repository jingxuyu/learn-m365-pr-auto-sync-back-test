  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, you're planning its Microsoft 365 deployment. You're currently investigating authentication strategies. While you're interested in Azure AD Connect Pass-through authentication, you're concerned whether Contoso's environment can support it. If you implement pass-through authentication, which of the following scenarios will it support?"
    choices:
    - content: "Users sign in to Outlook clients using legacy protocols such as Exchange ActiveSync, SMTP, POP, and IMAP"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This is a supported scenario for implementing PTA."
    - content: "Users sign in to Skype for Business client applications without modern authentication"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Users signing in to Skype for Business client applications without modern authentication is not supported for implementing PTA (although users signing in to Skype for Business client applications WITH modern authentication is supported). Try again."
    - content: "Access to calendar sharing and free/busy information in Exchange hybrid environments on Office 2010 only"
