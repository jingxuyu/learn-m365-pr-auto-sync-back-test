SharePoint Online is the cloud evolution of Microsoft SharePoint Server. It enables organizations to create team or communication-focused sites for efficient collaboration and communication in the digital workplace. Users can share files or folders with others inside or outside the organization. (Sharing outside the organization can be controlled by site administrators.) 

With SharePoint Online, users can:  
- Build sites and pages, document libraries, and lists. 
- Add web parts to customize their pages. 
- Share important visuals, news, and updates with a team or more broadly. 
- Search and discover sites, files, people, and news from across their organization. 
- Manage business processes with flows, forms, and lists. 
- Sync and store files in the cloud so anyone can securely work with them. 
- Catch up on news on-the-go with the SharePoint mobile app. 

## Compare SharePoint Online with an on-premises SharePoint Server
As a cloud-based service, SharePoint Online receives all the latest features with regular updates, managed by Microsoft. SharePoint Server, in comparison, needs an organization to maintain servers, including patching, updating, and setting up and maintaining the environment for high availability and disaster recovery. 

Some of the feature differences between SharePoint Online and SharePoint Server include:  
- SharePoint Server doesn't include anti-malware. 
- SharePoint Online doesn't have claims-based authentication. 
- Data loss prevention policies are available in SharePoint Online as part of Microsoft 365 E3 or Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions.  
- Encryption at rest is not available in SharePoint Server.
- Not all modern web parts are available in SharePoint Server 2019, no modern pages or parts are available on-premise for earlier versions.
