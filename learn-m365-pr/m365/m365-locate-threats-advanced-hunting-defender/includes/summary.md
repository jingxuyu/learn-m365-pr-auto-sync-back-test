Microsoft 365 Defender's advanced hunting capabilities allow your security teams and SOCs to build specific and tailored queries against the breadth of available data. This can identify previously unknown weaknesses in your security perimeter and fix them.  Using the advanced query data schemas you can explore existing attack data to find patterns and behaviors that will empower your security teams to remediate threats faster.  By creating custom detections, you can automate the identification and remediation actions, and reduce the time between an attack and its successful remediation.

By completing this module, you can:

- Use the advanced hunting query language, Kusto to query and explore your threat data.
- Use the advanced hunting query schemas to enrich your queries.
- Create custom detection queries to facilitate automated threat identification and resolution.
