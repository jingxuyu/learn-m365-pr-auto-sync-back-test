You can customize your Office Add-ins and enable your users to customize their experience.

## Add-in design guidelines

You should consider many factors as you design your add-in. The Office design principles are used by Office application designers and recommended for add-in design as well.

- Design explicitly for Office.
- Focus on a few key tasks; do them well.
- Favor content over chrome.
- Make it enjoyable and keep users in control.
- Design for all platforms and input methods.

However, you should balance with the following goals.

- Include your organization's branding
- Honor the look of the target platform (for example, Mac).
