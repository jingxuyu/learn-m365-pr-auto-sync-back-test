A policy tip is a notification or warning that appears when someone is working with content that conflicts with a DLP policy. Consider the scenario where a user is composing a message or sharing a document. If they're made aware of their organization’s expectations and standards in real time through policy tips, they'll be less likely to violate standards that their organization wants to enforce.

Policy tips can be entered in email, on sites, and in Office 2016 apps such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

### Policy tips in email

For email in Outlook on the web and in Outlook 2013 and later, the policy tip appears at the top of a message above the Recipients while the message is being composed.
