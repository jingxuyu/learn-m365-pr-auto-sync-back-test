Microsoft Teams is a powerful collaboration tool that offers messaging, storage, wiki pages, and integrates with SharePoint and Outlook. Teams also allows you to run virtual meetings amongst staff in your organization, whether in the office or working from home. Furthermore, it can let project teams communicate and collaborate with third-party vendors. Enabling meetings in Teams requires careful planning and preparation.

Suppose you're a Microsoft Teams administrator working for a large multinational organization. You've recently completed the successful roll out of Teams across your organization. Now, you want to extend Microsoft Teams to support meetings for your on-premises and work-from-home staff.
In this module, you'll see how to assess your organizations readiness to support meetings and plan how to deploy meetings for your staff.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to evaluate your organization's readiness to host cloud-based meetings through Teams.
- Plan for the deployment of meetings using Teams.
