**Microsoft Teams** is a hub for teamwork. It’s an app for people and teams to come together, stay connected, and get things done, across work, home, school, and on the go. Teams helps you pull together a team and connect with colleagues through real-time messaging and engaging and inclusive meetings. You can use channels to share files and data, manage tasks, and collaborate on documents with people inside and outside your organization. All these features can be done while staying secure and compliant. Make Teams your own by adding notes, websites, and integrating with other apps and processes your team uses.<br>

Users can access Teams through their internet browser, or by installing Teams on their computer or mobile device. Teams comes with many features and functionalities to help your users connect and work together to get things done.

### Teams and channels

Microsoft Teams encourages your users to organize and collaborate across projects and workloads. Get started by creating a **team** and/or **channel**.

 -  **Teams** are a collection of people, content, and tools surrounding different projects and outcomes within an organization. It’s designed to bring together a group of people who work closely to get things done. Teams can be created to be private to only invited users. Teams can also be public and open to anyone within the organization. A team has a limit of up to 10,000 simultaneous members.
 -  **Channels** are dedicated sections within a team to keep conversations organized by specific topics, projects, disciplines, or whatever works for your team. It’s a place where users can discuss and get hands-on with work. Channels facilitate features like tabs and make it possible for users to access and work on the same content. For instance, users in a team could have a channel with a tab for a specific report that they're all contributing to. Files that you share in a channel (on the Files tab) are stored in SharePoint.
    
     -  **Standard channels** can be open to all team members.
     -  **Private channels** are for selected team members.
     -  **Shared channels** can select people both inside and outside the team.

### Chat and instant messaging

**Chat and instant messaging** let you work together, without cluttering up your email and keeping it clear for important messages. Instant messaging is ideal if you need to check something with a colleague or ask a quick question. You can also have a group discussion to encourage open discussion and promote thoughtful debate.

The following list describes some of the benefits of Teams chat and instant messaging:

 -  **Instantly connect.** Message a team member one on one or the entire team in a group chat. Hop on a call or share a screen for immediate feedback.
 -  **Take conversations anywhere.** Record voice messages while you’re on the go, and reply to an instant chat from your mobile device.
 -  **Keep the team focused.** Organize your conversations, files, and apps in one place to keep the team in sync.
 -  **Reduce email clutter.** Move email threads into quick chats. Share photos and documents with one person or the team.

### Extend Teams by using collaborative apps<br>

A **collaborative app** is a solution integrated or built into Teams that enables employees to work better together, using the tools they already know. Microsoft Teams is an extensible platform that you can create custom applications on. Apps for Teams can be as simple or as complex, as you need, from sending notifications to channels or users, to complex multi-surface apps incorporating conversational bots, natural language processing, and embedded web experiences. You can build apps for an individual, your team, your organization, or for all Microsoft Teams users everywhere.
