    - content: "eDiscovery case"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This feature is available in theMicrosoft Purview compliance portal and serves the same purpose as eDiscovery hold, but with a different web interface. It also provides the ability to search across all Microsoft 365 services in a single, unified search operation."

    - content: "Run their searches using PowerShell rather than the Microsoft Purview compliance portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The source of the search isn't the issue."
    - content: "Clone their content searches into multiple, smaller searches"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Although enhanced by scalability and performance improvements, searching a large number of mailboxes or SharePoint sites when using Content Search may still take a while to complete. Cloning a Content Search can be used to break up a large, single search into multiple, smaller searches that run more quickly."

    - content: "Delete the returned messages using the Microsoft 365 Defender portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the next step that Alan should complete."
    - content: "Delete the returned messages using the Microsoft Purview compliance portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't the next step that Alan should complete."
    - content: "Connect to the Microsoft Compliance portal PowerShell and run the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet"

      explanation: "That's correct. After you've created and refined a Content Search to return the messages that you want to remove, the final step is to connect to the Microsoft Compliance portal PowerShell and then run the New-ComplianceSearchAction cmdlet to delete the messages. Deleted messages are moved to a user's Recoverable Items folder."
