In this module, you’ve learned about Zero Trust security concepts that help organizations to manage, monitor, and secure their resources. You should now understand the approach to implementing a Zero Trust strategy and how critical it is for organizations to enforce the Zero Trust principles of verify explicitly, apply least privileged access, and always assume breach. With a Zero Trust strategy in place, every request is verified and authenticated before access to a resource is granted.

The traditional network security approach has become obsolete and isn't strong enough to keep up with today’s rapidly evolving digital transformation. The Zero Trust security strategy provides end-to-end visibility and control across all domains—identity, endpoints, applications, network, infrastructure, and data. This integrated approach ensures security policies are enforced uniformly across every layer of a digital estate and enables real-time automated threat protection.

Now that you’ve completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the Zero Trust security model and its principles.
- Explain Zero Trust as a security strategy.
- Define Zero Trust components.
