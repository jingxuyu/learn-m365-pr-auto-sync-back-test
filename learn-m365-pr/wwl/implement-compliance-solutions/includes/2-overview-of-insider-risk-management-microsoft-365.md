Employees in the modern workplace have access to create, manage, and share data across a broad spectrum of platforms and services. In most cases, organizations have limited resources and tools to identify and mitigate organization-wide risks while also meeting employee privacy standards.

Insider risk management in Microsoft 365 uses the full breadth of service and third-party indicators. These services help organizations quickly identify, triage, and take action on risk activity. By using logs from Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Graph, insider risk management enables companies to define specific policies to identify risk indicators. These policies enable them to identify risky activities and to take action to mitigate these risks.

Insider risk management is centered around the following principles:

 -  **Transparency**. Balance employee privacy versus organization risk with privacy-by-design architecture.
 -  **Configurable**. Configurable policies based on industry, geographical, and business groups.
 -  **Integrated**. Integrated workflow across Microsoft 365 compliance solutions.
 -  **Actionable**. Provides insights to enable employee notifications, data investigations, and employee investigations.

Insider risk management helps an organization identify, investigate, and take action to address internal risks within the company. By implementing policy templates, companies can use:

 -  actionable insights to quickly identify and resolve risky behavior.
 -  comprehensive activity signaling across the Microsoft 365 service.
 -  a flexible workflow.

The following diagram shows the insider risk management workflow that Microsoft 365 follows. This workflow helps to identify and resolve internal risk activities and compliance issues.
