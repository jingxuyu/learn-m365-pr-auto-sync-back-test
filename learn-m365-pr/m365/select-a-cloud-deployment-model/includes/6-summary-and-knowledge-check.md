In this lesson, we discussed how you can work purely in the cloud or connect existing on-premises systems to the cloud to extend the value of legacy infrastructure. Then we looked at how the two different service models require different approaches - migration and coexistence. Finally, we reviewed some considerations for migrating systems with older versions of Windows, Office Server, and Office to Microsoft 365.
