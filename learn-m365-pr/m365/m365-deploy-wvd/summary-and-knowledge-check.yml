      choices:
      - content: "Local desktop"

      - content: "Personal desktop"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A personal desktop is an option in WVD. This is where each user has their own personal virtual machine. This is useful if the VM needs to be dedicated to one user and that user is a local admin."        
      - content: "Pooled desktop"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A pooled desktop is an option in WVD. Pooled desktops allow multiple user accounts to log into the same virtual machine. Pooled desktops in general are more efficient and less expensive in multi-user environments."

    - content: "Users can be assigned both remote apps and a remote desktop from the same host pool in the same app group using Windows Virtual Desktop."
      choices:
      - content: "True"

        explanation: "Incorrect. A host pool can have one app group assigned per user. App groups can either be one or several remote apps or one remote desktop."
      - content: "False"
