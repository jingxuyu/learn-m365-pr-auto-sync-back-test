## Introduction to channels
To align with the new method of delivering feature and quality updates in Windows 10, Microsoft introduced the concept of servicing channels to allow customers to designate how frequently their individual devices are updated. For example, an organization may have test devices that the IT department can update with new features as soon as possible as well as specialized devices that require a longer feature update cycle to ensure continuity. 

## Windows 10 servicing channels
Windows 10 offers 3 servicing channels:

- **Windows Insider Program** is available for organizations to test and provide feedback on features shipping in the next update. For many IT pros, early visibility into feature updates can be invaluable for both end-user communications as well as early testing. With Windows 10, feature flighting enables Windows Insiders to gain early access to updates and test them for possible issues before the update is broadly distributed.

- **Semi-Annual Channel** provides new functionality with feature update releases twice a year. Semi-Annual Channel releases are made available to any PC not configured to defer feature updates. Organizations using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), System Center Configuration Manager, or Windows Update for Business can defer feature updates to selected devices. 

- **Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)** provides feature updates every 2–3 years and is designed only for specialized devices or systems needing a longer servicing option. LTSC is available only in the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB edition and does not include applications not supported on Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB edition, including Office 365 ProPlus.

## Office 365 ProPlus Servicing Channels
Office 365 offers four servicing channels:

- **Office Insider Program** allows for organizations to test and provide feedback on the newest Office features and functionalities still in development.

- **Monthly Channel** provides users with the newest Office features as soon as they’re available with an expected release each month. The release might also contain non-security updates, such as those that provide stability or performance improvements. Monthly Channel releases are cumulative, containing all the features, security updates, and non-security updates from the previous Monthly Channel releases, and are supported only until the next Monthly Channel release. Although there is no set release schedule, security updates are usually released on the second Tuesday of the month. If there is a critical non-security issue that needs to be fixed, Microsoft provides a separate Monthly Channel release. 

- **Semi-Annual Channel** is the default channel for Office 365 ProPlus and provides new functionality with new features only twice per year in January and July.  It’s commonly used by organizations who don’t want to deploy the latest features right away or have a significant number of line-of-business applications, add-ins, or macros to test with Office. The release includes features that have already been released in the Monthly Channel as well as any necessary security updates. As with the Monthly Channel, any critical non-security updates are usually released on the second Tuesday of the month.

- **Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted)** is a fully supported build of Office that allows pilot users and application compatibility testers to test and validate the next Semi-Annual Channel release. Semi-Annual Channel (Targeted) releases provide the same features and functionality included in the next Semi-Annual Channel release and are expected to occur twice a year in March and September. New features aren’t released at any other time. Features included have already been released previously in Monthly Channel, and additional security updates, if needed, can also be added, usually on the second Tuesday of the month. Even though this update channel is primarily designed for testing, the release is a fully supported version of Office 365 ProPlus.
