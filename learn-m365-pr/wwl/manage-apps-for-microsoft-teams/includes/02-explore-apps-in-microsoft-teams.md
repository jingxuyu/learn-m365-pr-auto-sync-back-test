Teams apps let you do more in Teams. Think about the tools, files, and dashboards your org already uses. Many of them can be added right into Teams. Teams apps provide out-of-the-box tools that enable your organization to maximize its Teams experience in the context of a **channel in a team**, a **group chat**, or an individual **user** alone (personal).   

You can use apps functionality within Microsoft Teams to help you find content from your favorite services and then share it in Teams. Apps can assist you with things such as pinning services at the top of a channel, chatting with bots, and sharing and assigning tasks. For example, you can add the Microsoft Planner app to your initial Teams rollout to drive Teams adoption.

These apps combine the functionality of tabs, messaging extensions, connectors, and bots provided by **Microsoft**, built by a **third-party**, or by **developers** in your organization. There are several ways you can interact with apps and services in Teams: 

* **Share content on a tab**

    When you work with different people, you want different information and different tools on hand. You can add relevant files and apps as tabs to any Teams conversation. Tabs help you share content and functionality from your favorite services in a channel. They can connect you to Microsoft services (like Excel, SharePoint, Power Apps), other services (like Asana, YouTube, and Zendesk), or to a website of your choice. 

* **Get updates from a connector**

    Connectors keep your team current by delivering content and updates directly to a channel from services you frequently use. With connectors, Teams users can receive updates from popular services such as Twitter, Trello, Wunderlist, GitHub, and Azure DevOps Services in their Teams chats.

* **Add rich content to your messages**

    These apps find content from different services and send it straight to a message. You can share things like weather reports, daily news, images, and videos with anyone you're talking to. Messages sometimes include buttons for interacting with the app. For example, a daily weather report could include an option to download the forecast for the entire week.

* **Chat with a bot**
    
    Bots provide answers, updates, and assistance in private chats or channels. You can chat with them one-on-one or in a channel. Bots allow you to interact with cloud services such as task management, scheduling, and polling in a Teams chat.
