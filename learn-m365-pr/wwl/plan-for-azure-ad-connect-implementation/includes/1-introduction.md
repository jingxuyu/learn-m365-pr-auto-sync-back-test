This module examines all the planning aspects that must be considered when running Azure AD Connect to implement directory synchronization with Microsoft 365. To plan your directory synchronization with Microsoft 365, you must understand the source directory, such as Active Directory, and other connected directories. The planning task is crucial for a successful Microsoft 365 implementation.

After completing this module, you'll be able to: 

 *  Plan directory synchronization to synchronize your on-premises Active Directory objects to Azure AD
 *  Plan an Azure AD Connect implementation
 *  Plan for Azure AD Connect in a multi-forest scenario
