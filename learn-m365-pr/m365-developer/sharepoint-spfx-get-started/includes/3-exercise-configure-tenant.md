Open a browser and navigate to your Office 365 tenant's **SharePoint admin center** site: **https://{{REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TENANTID}}-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx**.

> Replace the text `{{REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TENANTID}}` in the above URL with the unique prefix for your Office 365 tenant. For example, if the domain for your SharePoint sites is **contoso.sharepoint.com**, then the unique prefix for your Office 365 tenant is **contoso**.
