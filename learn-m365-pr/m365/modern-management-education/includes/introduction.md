Until recently, managing your organization's devices meant lots of hands-on, manual, and time-consuming tasks, using a mix of on-premises tools. With Microsoft 365 you have access to a new type of device management, referred to as *cloud management*, that uses cloud-based services to simplify deployment and management, improve security, and improve the experience for your end users.


Imagine that you're an IT administrator for a K-12 school district. Your responsibilities include deploying and managing Microsoft 365. You've been asked to move the Windows devices that you're currently managing using standard, on-premises device management tools, to Microsoft 365's cloud management solution. 

After completing this module, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Migrate identities to the cloud via Azure Active Directory with School Data Sync
- Set up your Microsoft 365 tenant to fit the needs of your school
- Enroll devices at scale with either Windows Autopilot or the Set up School PCs app
- Deploy the right apps and policies to all devices
