Coexistence mode is a property of TeamsUpgradePolicy. Using coexistence mode, you manage interoperability and migration during the transition from Skype for Business to Teams.

TeamsUpgradePolicy exposes two key properties: Mode and NotifySfbUsers. Mode indicates the mode the client should run in. NotifySfbUsers indicates whether to show a banner in the Skype for Business client informing the user that Teams will soon replace Skype for Business. This cannot be true if Mode=TeamsOnly.

Teams provides all relevant instances of TeamsUpgradePolicy via built-in, read-only policies. Therefore, only Get and Grant cmdlets are available.

These policy instances can be granted either to individual users or on a tenant-wide basis. For example:

- To upgrade a user ($SipAddress) to Teams, grant the “UpgradeToTeams” instance:

   ```bash
   Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams -Identity $SipAddress
    ```

- To upgrade the entire tenant, omit the identity parameter from the grant command:

   ```bash
    Grant-CsTeamsUpgradePolicy -PolicyName UpgradeToTeams
    ```

## Federation considerations

Federation from Teams to another user using Skype for Business requires the Teams user be homed online in Skype for Business. Eventually, Teams users homed in Skype for Business on-premises will be able to federate with Teams only users.

TeamsUpgradePolicy governs routing for incoming federated chats and calls. Federated routing behavior is the same as for same-tenant scenarios, except in Islands mode. When recipients are in Islands mode:

- Chats and calls initiated from Teams land in SfB if the recipient is in a federated tenant.
- Chats and calls initiated from Teams land in Teams if the recipient is in the same tenant.
- Chats and calls initiated from SfB always land in Skype for Business.


## The Teams client user experience when using SfB modes

When a user is in any of the Skype for Business modes (SfBOnly, SfBWithTeamsCollab, SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings), all incoming chats and calls are routed to the user’s Skype for Business client. To avoid end-user confusion and ensure proper routing, calling and chat functionality in the Teams client is automatically disabled when a user is in any Skype for Business mode. Similarly, meeting scheduling in Teams is automatically disabled when users are in the SfBOnly or SfBWithTeamsCollab modes, and automatically enabled when a user is in the SfBWithTeamsCollabAndMeetings mode. 

## Setting your coexistence and upgrade settings

When you upgrade your Skype for Business users to use Teams, you have several options to help you make it a seamless process for your users. You can change coexistence and upgrade settings for all the users in your organization at once or you can change settings for a single or set of users in your organization. Older versions of Skype for Business clients may not honor these settings. 

You change coexistence and upgrade settings in the Teams admin center or by using PowerShell.
