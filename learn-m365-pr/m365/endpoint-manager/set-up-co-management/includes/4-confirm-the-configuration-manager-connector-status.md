The Configuration Manager connector provides details about your Configuration Manager implementation. When you've successfully attached your tenant to Configuration Manager, you'll see your connection is **Healthy**.

> [!NOTE]
> Attaching your tenant to Configuration Manager is called tenant attach. This involves registering your Intune tenant with your Configuration Manager deployment.

Once you confirm your tenant has been successfully attached, you can review details about the Configuration Manager connector, such as the last successful synchronization time and the connection status.

To display the Configuration Manager connector status:

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Tenant administration** > **Connectors and tokens** > **Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager**. Select a Configuration Manager hierarchy running version 2006, or later to display additional information about it.
