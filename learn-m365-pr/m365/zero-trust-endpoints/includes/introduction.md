Modern organizations deal with a great variety of endpoints, in larger numbers than ever before. They all require access to carry out a task or enable users to do their daily work. Following the recent increase in remote working, there's now a greater need for endpoints to have secure access from wherever and whenever it's required.

Let's take a look at endpoints in the Zero Trust journey:

Remember that Zero Trust requires adherence to the following security principles:

- Verify explicitly
- Use least privilege access
- Assume breach

To protect an organization and its users, these principles need to be applied to all endpoints.

First, you'll learn how to define endpoints then you'll see how to use the Zero Trust approach to protect them.
