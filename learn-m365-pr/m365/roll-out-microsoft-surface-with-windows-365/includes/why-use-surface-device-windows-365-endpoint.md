A Surface device is a powerful tool that seamlessly integrates into your tenant. So why would you want to switch to using a Cloud PC? In this unit, you'll see what a Windows 365 endpoint is and understand some of the key benefits of using Windows 365 on your Surface device.

## What is a Windows 365 endpoint?

An endpoint represents any device, such as a desktop, laptop, mobile device, network printer, virtual machine or server, which is connected to your organization's network-whether on-premises or in the cloud. A Windows 365 endpoint is no different and identifies the Cloud PC as a virtual device that can be managed using Microsoft Endpoint Manager.

## Why deploy a Surface device as a Windows 365 endpoint?

In today's varied work environment, it's no longer a given that all computers will be used on-premises, where both the hardware and software can be controlled and maintained. The technology used can vary from a laptop, to a smartphone, or tablet. Also, in some cases, the organization might not own the hardware, as staff adopt a BYOD approach. As a result, managing and maintaining both hardware and software, and keeping on top of security, can be daunting.

To compound matters, not all users are equal. Some may only require Office and Teams to carry out their work. Others, like developers, might require more powerful devices to run complex software, which comes at an extra cost. Windows 365 allows IT departments to provision the same basic Surface device to all users in the organization. The IT department can supply a Windows 365 Cloud PC for teams with power users that meet their needs rather than providing a costly high-specification machine. In those instances, the Cloud PC supersedes the Surface device as the user's primary desktop. The user connects from their Surface device via a remote desktop connection to the Cloud PC.

Windows 365 and Surface have been optimized to work seamlessly together.  Surface and Windows 365 were both designed to operate in and with the cloud.  One capability that is unique to Surface devices, is when you use Microsoft Teams in Windows 365.  When participating in a video or audio call using Teams, instead of using the Cloud PC virtual hardware, Windows 365 and Teams will instead use the hardware capabilities of the Surface device.

In addition to the scalability of the Cloud PC, another key benefit is data. Users need to access data in various forms, such as through a database or an Excel spreadsheet. Traditionally, users need to have data on their devices to access and work with it. If the user loses their device, there's a risk that the data might become compromised. However, with a Windows 365 Cloud PC, all data is retained within it and is never on the user's device.

Switching your users to Windows 365 Cloud PCs gives them the freedom to work from any location, be that a conference, sales demonstration on a client site, or their home office. All that's required is an internet connection.
