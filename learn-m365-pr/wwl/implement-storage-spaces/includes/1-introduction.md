Managing multiple physical disks attached directly to a computer can often be a tedious task for administrators. To overcome this problem, many organizations use SANs that group physical disks together. SANs require specialized configuration and sometimes specialized hardware, which makes them expensive. To overcome these issues, you can use the Storage Spaces feature. It pools disks together, and presents them to the operating system as a single disk. This module explains how to configure and implement the Storage Spaces feature.

### Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

 -  Explain what the Storage Spaces feature is.
 -  Describe the features of Storage Spaces.
 -  Discuss in which scenarios to use Storage Spaces.
 -  Show how to configure Storage Spaces.
