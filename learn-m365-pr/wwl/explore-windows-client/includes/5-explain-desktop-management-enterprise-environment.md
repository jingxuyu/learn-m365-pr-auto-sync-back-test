Enterprise environments provide a substantial number of challenges when it comes to managing desktop computers. Although the size of an enterprise environment varies, most typically include hundreds and sometimes tens of thousands of computers.

Because of the large number of computers in enterprise environments, the ability to centrally manage these computers is essential. For example, using one solution to install software updates across large numbers of computers is much more efficient than installing a software update manually on each computer in the organization.

By allowing users to manage their own computers, the following problems could occur:

 -  **Software update problems**. Many users are unaware of the need to keep operating system and application software up to date with security and operating system patches. Without centralized update management, some users will not maintain software updates.
 -  **Anti-malware problems**. Unless managed centrally, many users do not ensure that anti-malware software is enabled and up-to-date.
 -  **Application management**. Without centrally managed "locked down" configurations, users could install unauthorized software. Users often install unauthorized applications as an alternative to going through cumbersome organizational processes for requisitioning software.
 -  **Hardware support**. When enterprises purchase hardware, they often sign contracts for extended support. Should hardware fail, it is often relatively straightforward to obtain replacement parts, even entire replacement computers, within the support period. When users purchase their own hardware, they often are left to determine how best to repair the hardware should a failure occur.

To more efficiently manage a large fleet of computers, enterprises often use one or more standard operating environments (SOEs). An SOE is a set operating system, application, and hardware configuration. SOEs have the following benefits:

 -  **Simplified deployment of new and replacement computers**. Should new computers be required, deploying an SOE is more straightforward than building a configuration from scratch. You often can deploy an SOE from images using products such as Windows Deployment Services or Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. An alternative to apply a standard set of policies using an MDM such as Microsoft Intune to re-configure the device to meet organizational requirements.
 -  **Consistent applications and hardware** across the organization. Should a failure occur, information technology (IT) employees can replace the computer more quickly, enabling the user to remain productive. The replacement computer will have the same applications as the original computer, thereby ensuring that the user will have fewer adjustments to make to the replacement system.
 -  **Simplified inventory**. Organizations must keep track of hardware and software assets. It is far simpler to track hardware and software assets when all employees are using similarly configured computers, than it is to track hardware and software assets when each person has a uniquely configured computer, operating system, and application suite.
 -  **Simplified updating**. SOEs make the process of managing operating system and application updates simpler as the updates only need to be tested against a limited set of configurations.
 -  **Simpler software deployment**. Products such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager help simplify the process for deploying new or updated applications to computers.
