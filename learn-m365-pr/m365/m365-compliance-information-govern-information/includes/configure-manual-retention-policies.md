Publish labels so users can apply them to their content. When you publish labels to locations such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online and OneDrive, users can manually apply the labels to retain their content. A published label can also be used to apply a default retention policy to a location like a SharePoint Online document library.

Here are some important things to remember about published retention labels.

- Published retention labels can take one day to appear in SharePoint Online and OneDrive.
- Published retention labels can take seven days to appear in Exchange Online and the mailbox must contain 10 MB of data.
