Threat Trackers are informative widgets and views that provide you with intelligence on different cybersecurity issues that might impact your company. For example, you can view information about trending malware campaigns using Threat Trackers. Most tracker pages include:

 -  trending numbers that are updated periodically.
 -  widgets that identify which issues are the biggest or have grown the most.
 -  a quick link in the **Actions** column that takes you to Explorer, where you can view more detailed information.

To view and use your Threat Trackers, go to the Security &amp; Compliance Center and choose **Threat management** &gt; **Threat tracker**.

Available Threat Trackers include:

 -  Noteworthy trackers
 -  Trending trackers
 -  Tracked queries
 -  Saved queries.

Each of these features is examined in the following sections.

### Noteworthy trackers

Noteworthy trackers display large and small threats and risks that Microsoft thinks an organization should be aware of. Noteworthy trackers help organizations find whether these issues exist in their Microsoft 365 environments.

Noteworthy trackers also link to articles that provide more details on newsworthy events and how they'll impact an organization's use of Microsoft 365. These events may be a new threat or an existing threat that may create new challenges. An organization's security team can reference Noteworthy trackers to find important news items that it should periodically review and examine.

Noteworthy trackers are posted for just a couple of weeks once Microsoft identifies new threats that it feels organizations should know about. Once the biggest risk for a threat has passed, Microsoft will remove that Noteworthy item. This way, Microsoft can keep the list fresh and up to date with other relevant news items.

### Trending trackers

Trending trackers (formerly called Campaigns) highlight new threats that haven't been seen in an organization's email in the past week. Trending trackers provide visibility into new threats that organizations should review. In doing so, organizations can ensure their broader corporate environment is prepared against attacks.

### Tracked queries

Tracked queries use an organization's saved queries to periodically assess its Microsoft 365 activity. This feature provides an organization with event trending. Tracked queries run automatically, giving an organization up-to-date information without having to remember to rerun its queries.

### Saved queries

Saved queries are also found in the Trackers section. An organization can use Saved queries to store the common Explorer searches that it wants to get back to quicker and repeatedly, without having to re-create the search every time.

A Noteworthy tracker query or any of your own Explorer queries can be saved using the Save query button at the top of the Explorer page. Anything saved there will show up in the Saved queries list on the Tracker page.
