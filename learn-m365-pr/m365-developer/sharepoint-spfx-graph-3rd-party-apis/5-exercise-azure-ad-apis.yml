  title: Exercise - Call Azure AD secured REST APIs
  description: In this exercise, you'll create a new SharePoint Framework project with a single client-side web part that uses React and Microsoft Graph to display users in the currently logged in user's directory. You'll use the Azure AD HTTP client API included in the SharePoint Framework to authenticate and call the Microsoft Graph REST API.

  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "What is the recommended way to submit requests to Azure AD secured HTTP REST APIs?"
    choices:
    - content: "Import the jQuery library and use the `jQuery.ajax()` method, obtain an access token from Azure AD, and include it in the `authorization` HTTP request header."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `AadHttpClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API."
    - content: "Use the `AadHttpClient` object from the SharePoint Framework API, returned by calling the `this.context.aadHttpClientFactory.getClient('https://...')` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the browser's built in support for the Fetch API, obtain an access token from Azure AD, and include it in the `authorization` HTTP request header."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Use the `AadHttpClient` object included as part of the SharePoint Framework API. Its automatically configured to include the OAuth2 access token in the authorization header."
  - content: "You must include an OAuth2 access token in an HTTP request to an Azure AD secured HTTP REST API. How do you obtain this access token?"
    choices:
    - content: "Once you've granted your SharePoint Online tenant permissions to the HTTP REST API, call the `this.context.aadHttpClientFactory.getClient('https://...')` method to receive an instance of the `AadHttpClient` object. This object is already configured to include the OAuth2 access token in the authorization HTTP request header. "
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "Use the browser's built in support for the Fetch API, obtain an access token from Azure AD, and include it in the `authorization` HTTP request header."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this will work, it requires a lot more code than the `aadHttpClientFactory` and `AadHttpClient` objects included in the SharePoint Framework API."
    - content: "First obtain an access token from Azure AD, and include it in the `authorization` HTTP request header using the `HttpClient` SharePoint Framework API."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "While this will work, it requires a lot more code than the `aadHttpClientFactory` and `AadHttpClient` objects included in the SharePoint Framework API."
