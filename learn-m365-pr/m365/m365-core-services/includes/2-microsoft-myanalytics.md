MyAnalytics helps you:

- Organize your time and tasks effectively
- Stay connected and informed on the go
- Focus on what matters to you
- Create healthy work habits and goals for yourself 

MyAnalytics uses data from your Office 365 mailbox; specifically, data about emails, meetings, and chats and calls in Teams and in Skype for Business. MyAnalytics doesn't use an agent or tracking software to capture this data. MyAnalytics also doesn't use data from activities on your computer, like apps you use or websites you visit.

MyAnalytics provides insights in various ways:

- **MyAnalytics personal dashboard**: Statistics on how youâ€™ve spent your time over the past week.
- **Outlook add-in**: Interactive insight cards that report on aspects of your recent work experience. 
- **Email digests**: Weekly highlights about your previous week.
- **MyAnalytics nudges**: Notifications in Microsoft Outlook that can help boost your productivity by displaying useful suggestions and tips around emails, meetings, and to-do tasks.
