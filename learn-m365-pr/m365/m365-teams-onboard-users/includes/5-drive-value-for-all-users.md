You can use your early adopters and champions to support a broader scale roll out of Teams through your organization. Teams admin center provides you with reports to monitor if you have met the desired business outcomes for your organization's use of Teams.

Here, you'll see what reporting is available to measure the success of your Teams roll out and review the approaches you can take for the full rollout.

## Monitor Teams adoption using the Teams and Microsoft 365 admin centers

## Encourage ongoing engagement

With the pilot phases completed you shouldn't be afraid to share those success stories showing how your team uses Teams to make the project a success. Consider periodically hosting town hall meetings or lunch & learns to continue to drive the end-user engagement.
Try to reward people for changing their work behaviors - cultural evolution is critical to adoption of any new technology. Remember to maintain and support your champions and continue to grow them as you roll out Teams further in your organization.

**Workplace Analytics** has a section to analyze Teams collaboration. You should utilize this to assess Teams adoption.

### Expand your implementation team

In a large organization, you should try to incorporate many different roles in your broad onboarding phase. This may include additional business sponsors, training helpdesk and IT support staff, additional members in your champion community, and in some cases formal change management or training personnel. The illustration below shows a large-scale adoption team that allows for a separation of duties.

:::image type="content" border="false" source="../media/5-teams-adoption-large-scale-model.png" alt-text="Diagram of the Large-Scale Adoption Model" lightbox="../media/5-teams-adoption-large-scale-model.png":::

In a smaller organization, one or more of these roles might be performed by a single individual, but the skills required remain the same. Technical, communication, and training skills are important in a successful change project.

### Select an enablement strategy

Teams is a transformative technology, depending on the size of your organization and your existing technologies, you may take different approaches. The following are recommendations for most customer organizations.

- *Choose Teams First or Teams Core*: Most organizations have an existing investment in Microsoft technology. You may be launching more than one workload at a time, such as Exchange Online, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint. In these cases, selecting Teams First or Teams Core is a wise choice. It will enable your users to get used to the enhanced collaboration experience of Teams. Your collaboration project team can then plan to roll out additional capabilities and the training and support required for them to be successful.
- *Choose Teams Go Big*: In new Microsoft 365 or Office 365 customer organizations, it is often best to take a Teams Go Big approach to minimize the change fatigue caused by learning new technology multiple times. You'll get the greatest benefit by enabling Teams for both core collaboration and meetings, SharePoint, OneDrive, Planner, and other workloads, and allowing your employees to learn about them in the context of your Teams deployment.

    Teams Go Big is also the preferred enablement strategy for organizations under 1,000 employees who want to simplify their employee communication and engagement. Using the organization-wide team can bring people together to review common tasks and initiatives on any device.

- *Choose Side by Side*: For organizations that are using Skype for Business for audio conferencing, support for conference room devices, or cloud voice capabilities, we recommend running Teams and Skype side by side to familiarize your employees with the core collaboration features while planning your migration off of Skype for Business at a time that is convenient for your company.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Running both clients side by side can introduce user confusion about which tool to use, so we recommend keeping this phase in your adoption journey short.

- *Choose Migration*: Migrating from Skype for Business to Teams has additional components from a technical perspective, but the user adoption journey has the same components as a Teams Go Big implementation. In addition, you will be educating people about the Teams meeting experience and interface, the new persistent chat behavior, and other elements of the experience that are different from Skype for Business.

For each enablement strategy, it's essential to work closely with your technical readiness team to ensure that your environment will deliver a great employee experience.

Select an enablement strategy that will best support your business outcomes for Teams and that can be enabled by your technical implementation team. This is a joint decision between IT leadership, program management leads, and user adoption specialists. This decision often rests with the executive stakeholder who is the ultimate success owner for Teams or collaboration services in your organization.

### Incorporating feedback

Throughout your drive value phase, you'll be capturing information about how people have used the product and their experience. Use this information now to adjust your awareness and training programs as you plan to expand its use across your business units.

It is recommended to set up a Team specifically for help and feedback during your roll-out. This should have a dedicated team with chat availability to support users. You should include a frequently asked questions (FAQs) section.  Some common example questions might be:

- When do I use this new tool alongside my existing technology?
- Who is approved to use this tool with me?
- Is it safe for highly confidential information?
- Who do I speak with to learn more about Teams?
- Something's not working. How do I get help?

### Invest in your champions

As you prepare to scale your usage of Teams, recruit additional champions in each business unit or group you are expanding to. Enroll these enthusiastic people in your service training program and standardize how and when you meet with them.

Be clear in your champions program design what your employees will get and what they're expected to give if they become champions. Common program requirements are scheduled office hours, participation in monthly community calls, and participation in internal online communities to support your transition to these new experiences.

**Best Practice**: Hold a monthly Teams meeting for your internal champions. Split your agenda between teaching new features, addressing feedback, and providing self-service tools for your employee community.
**Best Practice**: Have representatives from your internal support department or IT Helpdesk join your champions community to stay up to date on new information about your Teams usage.
