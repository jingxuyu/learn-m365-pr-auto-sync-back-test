Administrators in the following three roles manage the Search & intelligence settings and content experience for Microsoft Search: 

**Global admin**: Has complete control over, and complete access to, Search & intelligence features and all other enterprise apps and services that contribute to the Microsoft Search experience, including settings for branding, news feed, and the Bing homepage. Only a Global admin can assign the roles of Search admins or Search editors.

**Search admin**: This role can create and manage answer content and settings, add connectors to make more data sources accessible in Microsoft Search, and make other configurations, and customizations. They can perform all of the content-management tasks a Search editor can.

**Search editor**: Usually tasked with the management of answer content such as bookmarks, acronyms, and so on. They have the same permissions and limitations as a Search admin.

The table below provides a more detailed look at each of these roles and the tasks that are available to them.

### Assigning roles

The IT admin from our scenario has recruited someone from the team to manage and create Microsoft Search content. The IT admin is the organizationâ€™s Global admin and wants to assign a Search admin role to them. Below, we outline the steps to assign such a role.

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), select **Users** > **Active Users**.
2. Choose a user account to open the user details pane, select **Manage roles**.

3. Select **Admin center access**.
4. Expand **Show all by category** to display a list of predefined specialty roles.
5. The **Collaboration** section appears at the top of the expanded list. In this section, you'll see two search-specific roles: **Search admin** and **Search editor**.
