The quickest way to start using DLP policies is to create a new policy from a template. Using templates saves you the work of building a new set of rules from scratch. They also save you from having to determine which types of information should be included by default. You can then modify the rule’s conditions and actions to meet your organization’s specific requirements.

A preconfigured DLP policy template can help organizations detect specific types of sensitive information, such as:

 -  HIPAA data
 -  PCI-DSS data
 -  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act data
 -  locale-specific personal information

The templates included in Microsoft 365 already contain the most common sensitive information types and compliance regulations for various countries/regions around the globe. This design makes it easy for companies to find and protect common types of sensitive information.

For example, consider the DLP policy template for the U.S. Patriot Act. This template already includes rules referencing the necessary sensitive information types covered by that policy. This data includes credit card numbers, tad ID numbers, bank account numbers, and Social Security numbers. The rules in this DLP policy template are designed to help organizations easily find and protect that information.

Microsoft 365 includes the following methods that will enable you to begin creating DLP policies in the Security and Compliance Center:

 -  **Apply a template supplied by Microsoft.** The quickest way to start using DLP policies is to create a new policy using a built-in template. Using a template saves you from having to build a new set of rules from nothing. When using a built-in template, you must know what type of data to check for or which compliance regulation you're attempting to address. You must also know your organization’s expectations for processing such data.
 -  **Create a custom policy with one or more different pre-existing conditions.** If the templates don't apply completely to your business needs, you can create a custom policy that combines the required information types together for your individual needs.
 -  **Create a custom policy without any pre-existing conditions.** An organization may have its own requirements for monitoring certain types of data known to exist within a messaging system. In this scenario, an organization can choose one of the following options:
    
     -  customize the built-in policy templates with its own unique requirements.
     -  choose the Custom template, which has no default rules, and configure a DLP policy from scratch to meet the organization's unique compliance requirements.

After you've added a policy, you can review and change its rules, make the policy inactive, or remove it completely.
