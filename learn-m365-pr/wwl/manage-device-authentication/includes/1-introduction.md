Besides managing user authentication and protecting user identities, it is also very important to cover device authentication when deploying Azure AD in your organization. In a similar way to a user, a device is becoming another identity you want to protect. You can also use a device to protect your resources at any time and location. Azure AD allows you to join Windows based devices, as well as to manage them by using somewhat different methods than in Active Directory Domain Services. In this module, you will learn about device authentication and management in Azure AD.
