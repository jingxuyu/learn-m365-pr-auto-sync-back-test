OKR Champions are the point of contact and the driving force for your OKR program. This person will mentor and coach people on the team, ensuring that everyone understands the program and actively participates. Have a question about OKRs? This is your go-to person. The OKR Champion facilitates the OKR process and drives adoption, either across the entire organization or within their department as part of a broader cross-functional OKR Champion group.

While smaller companies may only need one Champion, larger enterprise companies will have several Champions that form a cross-departmental team. Generally, there should be one OKR Champion for every 50 employees. OKR Champions can come from any level of the organization, and for larger companies, having Champions at various levels can increase adoption and create a smoother rollout.

In large organizations, having a dedicated subculture of OKR Champions who have gone above and beyond the typical end-user training creates a community of support and generates excitement. In smaller organizations, this can be a single person who drives the entire process. 

While the role can extend to many different responsibilities, there are four key responsibilities for all OKR Champions.

- Be the communications center for all things OKR-related.
- Set organizational expectations for OKRs.
- Set up training opportunities and hold teams accountable.
- Celebrate OKR wins.
