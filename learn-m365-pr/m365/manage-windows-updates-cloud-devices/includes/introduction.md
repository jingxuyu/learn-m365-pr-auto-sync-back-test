Windows Update for Business is a service that offers updates to Windows devices, including the latest security defenses and features for Windows. The Windows Update for Business deployment service is a service designed to enable you to control these updates for your devices, through capabilities like scheduling, approvals, expedited updates, and more.

To use the deployment service, you'll need a management tool. The Microsoft Graph PowerShell Software Development Kit (SDK), is a library that enables you to use PowerShell as your tool to manage updates through the deployment service.

Imagine you’re an admin for an organization that uses Windows 10 or later devices. It’s your job to keep those devices up to date with security updates and operating system updates. You want to control when and how to apply these updates and to address critical security issues, when necessary, quickly and easily.

In this module, you’ll learn how to use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to enroll devices in to the Windows Update for Business deployment service to schedule, deploy, and expedite updates.

By the end of this module, you’ll able to:

- Enroll and unenroll devices in the service.
- Discover Windows updates.
