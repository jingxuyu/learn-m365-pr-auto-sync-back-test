Prior to October 2019 (version 1906 and earlier), System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) provided a unified device and application management console. SCCM included an automated set of administrative tools to deploy software, protect data, monitor health, and enforce compliance across all Windows devices in an organization. In October 2019 (starting in version 1910), Configuration Manager replaced and expanded on the SCCM role.

Configuration Manager is part of Microsoft Endpoint Manager. Configuration Manager:

 -  Supports the faster pace of updates for Windows devices (Windows 10 and later).
 -  Manages other versions of the Windows operating system.
 -  Integrates with Microsoft Intune.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > As mentioned in the prior unit, the integration of Configuration Manager and Intune is referred to as Co-management. **Configuration Manager (Current Branch) version 1710 or newer is required to enable co-management**.

Configuration Manager enables quick and easy delivery of updates. As a result, you can always have the latest Windows management features available. Updates for Configuration Manager (Current Branch) are released three times a year. Each version is supported for 18 months from its general availability release date.

The following table identifies the main features included in the Configuration Manager (Current Branch).
