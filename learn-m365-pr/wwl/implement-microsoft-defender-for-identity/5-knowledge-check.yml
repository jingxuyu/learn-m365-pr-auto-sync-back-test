      explanation: "That's correct. Every domain controller in a company's environment should be covered by a Defender for Identity sensor or standalone sensor. Installed directly on an organization's domain controller or AD FS servers, the Defender for Identity sensor accesses the event logs it requires directly from the servers. The sensor sends only the parsed information retrieved from the logs and network traffic to the Defender for Identity cloud service."
