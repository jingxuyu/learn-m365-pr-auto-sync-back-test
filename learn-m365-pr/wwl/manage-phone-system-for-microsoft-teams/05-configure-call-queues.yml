  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso's Microsoft 365 project team is considering using a Teams channel for their call agents. In doing so, they can assign an outbound caller ID number for the agents by specifying one or more resource accounts with a phone number. What should Contoso's project team consider doing if they don't use a Teams channel to control agent membership?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implement presence-based routing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Presence-based routing uses the availability status of call agents to determine whether an agent should be included in the call routing list for the selected routing method. Try again."
    - content: "Set the caller ID for members of the call queue to the service number of the call queue or appropriate auto attendant"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If you're not using a Teams channel to control agent membership, consider directly setting the caller ID for members of the call queue to the service number of the call queue or appropriate auto attendant."
    - content: "Set the routing method to round robin"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Round robin routing method balances the routing of incoming calls so that each call agent gets the same number of calls from the queue. Try again."
