Data loss prevention (DLP) is a security feature that protects sensitive data in email, SharePoint content, and Office files from being accidentally or intentionally shared with unauthorized users. For instance, DLP can prevent someone from sharing personal information or intellectual property, or stop someone from accidentally emailing a file attachment to an unauthorized recipient.

This module examines the fundamentals of data loss prevention in Exchange and SharePoint. Data loss prevention is configured through DLP policies. Policies consist of conditions and actions that are centered around identifying sensitive information data. In this module, you'll learn how conditions and actions work together to support data loss prevention in Microsoft 365. This module also explores policy tips that are displayed for users when DLP policies don't apply. To assist organizations in defining DLP policies, Microsoft 365 provides policy templates that can be used as a starting point for configuring policies.

This module also introduces you to a DLP featured called Document Fingerprinting. In the Security and Compliance Center, document fingerprinting makes it easier for organizations to protect the different types of information that are handled each day. It provides this protection by identifying standard forms that are used throughout each organization. Document fingerprinting converts these standard forms into sensitive information types. These types can later be used in the rules of an organization's DLP policies.

Many organizations already have a process to identify and classify sensitive information by using either:

 -  the classification properties in Windows Server File Classification Infrastructure (FCI).
 -  the document properties in SharePoint.
 -  the document properties applied by a third-party system.

This module examines how these organizations can create a DLP policy in Microsoft 365 that recognizes the properties that have been applied to documents by Windows Server FCI or other systems. This design enables the DLP policy to be enforced on Office documents with specific FCI or other property values.<br>

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Data Loss Prevention is managed in Microsoft 365.
 -  Understand how DLP in Microsoft 365 uses sensitive information types and search patterns.
 -  Describe what a DLP policy is and what it contains.
 -  Recognize how actions and conditions work together for DLP.
 -  Explain how actions contain functions to send emails on matches.
 -  Create policy tips for users when a DLP rule applies.
 -  Use policy templates to implement DLP policies for commonly used information.
 -  Explain document fingerprinting.
 -  Describe how DLP protects documents in Windows Server FCI.
