As previously mentioned, Microsoft 365 includes two Mobile Device Management (MDM) services: Basic Mobility and Security and Microsoft Intune. This unit provides a detailed examination of each offering. Hopefully, this information will help organizations determine which solution provides the best fit to meet their MDM requirements.

### Introduction to Basic Mobility and Security

The Basic Mobility and Security service provides a built-in MDM solution within Microsoft 365. This service provides the core device management features available in Microsoft 365. It's hosted by the Intune service and includes a subset of Intune services.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Basic Mobility and Security service provides core MDM functionality within Microsoft 365 for managing devices in an organization. Even though it includes some Intune features, it's NOT an "Intune-lite" solution.

Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that are used to access work email, calendar, contacts, and documents play a significant part in making sure that employees get their work done anytime, from anywhere. So it’s critical that organizations protect their business data when people use devices. They can use Basic Mobility and Security to set device security policies and access rules, and to wipe mobile devices if they’re lost or stolen.

Organizations can use Basic Mobility and Security to manage many types of mobile devices, such as Windows Phone, Android, iPhone, and iPad. To manage mobile devices used by company employees, each person must have an applicable Microsoft 365 license, and their device must be enrolled in Basic Mobility and Security.

After an organization has set up Basic Mobility and Security and its users have enrolled their devices, it can manage the devices, block access, or even wipe a device, if needed.

### Introduction to Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune provides the core features found within Basic Mobility and Security, plus more advanced device management features. Intune is Microsoft's gold-level standard for MDM solutions. It's not only a cloud-based service, but its focus extends beyond mobile device management (MDM). It also includes mobile application management (MAM).

 -  **Device management.** Intune enables an organization to control how its devices are used, including mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. It also enables employees in an organization to use their personal devices for work. On personal devices, Intune helps ensure that organization data stays protected, and it can isolate organizational data from personal data.
 -  **Application management.** Intune enables organizations to configure specific policies to control applications. For example, an organization can prevent emails from being sent to people outside the company.

Many organizations, such as Microsoft, use Intune to secure proprietary data that users access from both their company-owned and personal mobile devices. Intune helps organizations secure and monitor data access by including:

 -  device and app configuration policies
 -  software update policies
 -  installation statuses (charts, tables, and reports)

It's common for people to have multiple devices that use different platforms. For example, an employee may use Surface Pro for work and an Android mobile device in their personal life. It's also common for people to access organizational resources, such as Microsoft Outlook and SharePoint, from each of their devices.

With Intune, organizations can manage multiple devices per person and the different platforms that run on each device, including iOS/iPadOS, macOS, Android, and Windows. Intune separates policies and settings by device platform. So it's easy to manage and view the devices of a specific platform.

### MDM within Microsoft 365 plans

Basic Mobility &amp; Security is part of the Microsoft 365 plans. However, Microsoft Intune is a standalone product that's included with certain Microsoft 365 plans. The following chart identifies which plans provide each MDM solution.

> You can't start using Basic Mobility &amp; Security if you're already using Microsoft Intune.

### Differences in capabilities

While Microsoft Intune and built-in Basic Mobility &amp; Security both give organizations the ability to manage their mobile devices, there are key differences in capabilities between the two solutions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Basic Mobility and Security service provides core MDM functionality and a subset of functionality provided by Intune. For organizations requiring a more advanced MDM solution, Microsoft Intune provides this same core functionality as Basic Mobility and Security, plus advanced MDM features and Mobile Application Management (MAM).

The key differences between these two MDM offerings are summarized in the following table. Organizations can use this side-by-side comparison to help decide which Microsoft 365 MDM service is the best fit for their requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> Users and their mobile devices can be managed using both Intune and Basic Mobility &amp; Security in the same Microsoft 365 Business Standard organization. To do so, you must set up Basic Mobility &amp; Security first and then add Microsoft Intune. This design enables organizations to choose whether they want to manage a user’s devices with Basic Mobility &amp; Security or the more feature-rich Intune solution. The license assignment determines which service the device is enrolled in. For example, assigning an Intune license enables the Intune-only features.
