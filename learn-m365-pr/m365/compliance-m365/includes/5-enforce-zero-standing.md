Organizations are twice as likely to get breached through compromised credentials than through any other threat vector. Having perpetual or standing privileged access to an application is all that is needed to execute commands to expose data and inflict damage. Therefore, increasingly regulators and customers expect businesses to provide documentation and an audit trail of when privileged access was provided. One way to address this is by adopting the principle of Zero Standing Access. 

## Customer Lockbox for Office 365
Microsoft runs their organization and datacenters on the principle of Zero Standing Admin Access – that means users do not have permissions by default to perform privileged tasks, or access sensitive data on their own. When required, all access requests go through a privileged access workflow, allowing users just-in-time and just-enough access for the task they need to perform. All such requests require approvals and have significant oversight.

One additional control over access to customer content is offered through Customer Lockbox. Customer Lockbox requires the customer, such as the tenant admin or a custom role like the compliance manager, to approve the request before access is granted to Microsoft engineers. The transparency, control and security rigor provided through this Customer Lockbox workflow is above and beyond what other major SaaS vendors offer today.

Together, these controls enable Microsoft engineers and customers, to enforce Zero Standing Access by default for service provider access, which is a significant leap in keeping our datacenters and our customers’ data secure and compliant. 

## Privileged access management in Office 365
Taking all the learnings from how Microsoft manages its own datacenter, Office 365 has built a similar Privileged Access Management system to help customers manage privileged admin access to their users who typically are the tenant admins. This system is built on the principles of Zero Standing Access and requires users to request just-in-time and just-enough access to perform their tasks at hand. 

With privileged access management in Office 365, access requests must be approved by an authorized set of approvers. Requests for access can be automatically or manually approved. Either way, all the activity is logged and auditable, so that both privileged access requests and approvals can be reviewed and seamlessly provided for internal reviews and auditor requests.
