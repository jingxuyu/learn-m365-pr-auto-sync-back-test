    questions:
    - content: "What happens when a user shares a link to a file in SharePoint with someone?"
      choices:
      - content: "That person is given direct access to the file."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. Direct access is never given to files."
      - content: "A sharable link is created which has permission to access the file."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct. A sharable link is created which has permissions to access the file. The person can then follow that link to access the file."
      - content: "The file is automatically emailed as an attachment to the person."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. It is possible to add a SharePoint file as an attachment or send the shareable link in an email, but this doesn't happen automatically."

    - content: "Which of the following statements is true?"
      choices:
      - content: "**Specific people** links can be used to provide guest access to files and folders."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct. **Specific people** links work for those inside and outside your organization provided guest sharing has been enabled."
      - content: "**Anyone** links require people to sign in if they are outside the organization."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. People using an **Anyone** link do not have to authenticate, and their access cannot be audited."
      - content: "**People in your organization** links can be used to share sites with anyone in the organization."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. **People in your organization** links allow users to share files and folders (but not the site) with people who aren't part of a team or members of a site."
      
    - content: "What do you need to configure if you want new site members to be approved by the site owner?"
      choices:
      - content: "Configure site sharing settings to prevent guest users from being invited."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. SharePoint site access requests are used to require new users to be approved by a site owner before they can access the site."
      - content: "Configure the Microsoft 365 Group to be private instead of public."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. SharePoint site access requests are used to require new users to be approved by a site owner before they can access the site."
      - content: "Configure site access requests for that site."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct. SharePoint site access requests are used to require new users to be approved by a site owner before they can access the site."
