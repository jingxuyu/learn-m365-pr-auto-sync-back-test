In this module, you learned how to manage a hybrid deployment and implement advanced hybrid functionality. You also examined the features that require a successful hybrid deployment, such as Public Folder coexistence and OneDrive for Business attachment storage for on-premises mailboxes.

The module examined why a hybrid Exchange deployment supports coexistence with on-premises Public Folders. Coexistence enables Messaging administrators to configure their cloud mailboxes to access Public Folders located on their local Exchange servers. This design is required during migration if an organization uses Public Folders.

You learned that once an organization implements a hybrid deployment to connect its on-premises Exchange environment to Exchange Online, it must then manage the deployment. Managing a hybrid deployment enables you to implement advanced functionality that wouldn't be possible without a hybrid deployment.

This module also explored the special management and monitoring requirements of a hybrid deployment. These requirements are because of the complex configuration of hybrid deployments that automatically exchange information between the Exchange Server on-premises organization and Exchange Online. You learned that the complexity of this configuration isn't visible to end users, but that you must monitor specific areas of the deployment to ensure that it functions properly.

The module then introduced you to Open Authorization, or OAuth. OAuth is required for some Exchange-related features, such as cross-premises discovery and automatic archive retention. You learned how to manually configure OAuth for your Exchange organization.

The module concluded by examining how to configure OneDrive access for on-premises mailboxes. Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019 enable organizations to configure on-premises mailboxes that can store attachments in OneDrive for Business. This functionality preserves space on your on-premises Exchange Servers because user attachments aren't stored in the mailbox. Instead, they're stored in OneDrive with a link in the e-mail to the original attachment, should the user choose to upload them. You also learned how to store attachments from an on-premises mailbox on OneDrive for Business.
