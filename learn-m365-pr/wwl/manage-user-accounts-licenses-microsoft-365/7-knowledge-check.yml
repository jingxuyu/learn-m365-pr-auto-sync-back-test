  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You're the Enterprise Administrator for Tailspin Toys, which has a Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 subscription. When a member of the Accounting department recently left the company, you deleted the user's account. What will happen to the user's Microsoft 365 license?"
    choices:
    - content: "Because the user account is soft deleted for 30 days, the license will remain unavailable for 30 days before it can be assigned to another user"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't what happens to a user's Microsoft 365 license when you delete the user's account."
    - content: "To ensure the license is not assigned to another user in the event the deleted user account is restored, the license is placed on hold and can't be reassigned until the Global Admin runs a PowerShell command that releases the hold"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This isn't what happens to a user's Microsoft 365 license when you delete the user's account."
    - content: "The license for that user becomes available and can be assigned to another user"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you delete a user account, the user's license becomes available. You can then assign the unused license to another user."
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Fabrikam, you're planning its migration to Microsoft 365. You plan to authenticate all of Fabrikam's users in Azure Active Directory. In doing so, you want the hashes of your users' passwords replicated between Fabrikam's on-premises environment and Microsoft 365. Which type of identity should you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Synchronized identity"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Synchronized identities are authenticated in Azure Active Directory using hashes of user passwords that are synchronized between the on-premises environment and Microsoft 365."
    - content: "Cloud identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While Cloud identities are authenticated in Azure Active Directory, they don't require replication of password hashes between the on-premises environment and Microsoft 365."
    - content: "Federated identity"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Federated identities don't require replication of password hashes between the on-premises environment and Microsoft 365."
