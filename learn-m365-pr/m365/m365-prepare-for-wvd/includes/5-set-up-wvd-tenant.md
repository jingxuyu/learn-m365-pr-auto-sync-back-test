## Host pool steps

## Create via PowerShell 

We'll use PowerShell cmdlets to create the Windows Virtual Desktop tenant. First, import and install the Windows Virtual Desktop PowerShell module, Microsoft.Rdinfra.RdPowershell. In an elevated PowerShell console or PowerShell ISE, running as administrator, run the following cmdlet to import the module:

```powershell
Import-module Microsoft.Rdinfra.RdPowershell 
```

You might need to install the NuGet provider to complete the import. If prompted, select **Yes**. 

Run the following cmdlet to install the module:

```powershell
Install-module Microsoft.Rdinfra.RdPowershell 
```

After you install and load the module, run the following PowerShell cmdlet to sign in to Windows Virtual Desktop: 

```powershell
Add-RdsAccount â€“DeploymentURL "https://rdbroker.wvd.microsoft.com" 
```

Sign in with the credentials for a user with the Tenant Creator role. 

Next run the following cmdlet to create your tenant: 

```powershell
New-RdsTenant -Name <TenantName> -AadTenantID <DirectoryID> -AzureSubscriptionID <SubscriptionID> 
```

Replace \<TenantName\> with a name for your tenant, something like your domain prefix. Replace \<DirectoryID\> with the Azure AD directory ID you copied to the clipboard. Finally, replace \<SubscriptionID\> with the Azure Subscription ID. (You can find this ID in the Azure portal in **All Services > Subscriptions**.)   

At this point, you've successfully created your Windows Virtual Desktop tenant. You're now ready to start building out your VMs in Windows Virtual Desktop host pools.
