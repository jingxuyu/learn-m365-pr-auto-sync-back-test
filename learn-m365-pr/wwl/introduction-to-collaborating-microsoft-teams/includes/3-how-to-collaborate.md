You can think of Microsoft Teams as your modern, digital workspace. It's where you'll store and access files, meet, have conversations and use apps that help you get things done. In this unit, you'll learn about the core features of Microsoft Teams and how they can help you collaborate with your team.<br>

## Create teams and channels to reflect your work

In Microsoft Teams, you can create **teams** to bring groups of people together around projects, topics, or other collaboration needs. Within those teams, you can set up **channels** that are dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project. Channels are where team conversations take place, files are stored, and one place where meetings can take place in Teams. Microsoft Teams is flexible, allowing you to set up teams and channels that reflect the culture and needs of your team or organization. You can make it easier for your teams to get work done by integrating the apps you use every day right within Teams.

## Work in channels

Within channels, you can have conversations visible to the members of the channel by starting and engaging with posts and announcements in the channel. Share files that are relevant to the conversation as attachments, or upload them directly to the channel for easy access. Outlook can be used with Teams as needed, allowing you to share conversations from Teams to Outlook, and share emails to your channel to discuss within Teams. Quickly access files and collaborate within apps like Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint right within the context of your channels and conversations in Teams.

## Start one-on-one or group chats and calls

Chat in Microsoft Teams allows you to have private one-on-one or group conversations that aren't relevant to the members of a team or channel. Customize your messages with rich text editing, tag people to call their attention, and use your favorite apps in chats. Customize your notifications so that you keep up with important conversations and aren't distracted by less important chats. You can start 1:1 or group calls from chats or from anywhere in Teams to communicate in the way that's best for the conversation.

## Meet and host live events

With online meetings in Teams, you can host audio and video conference calls from any device, as well as live events with up to 10,000 people. Share your content and collaborate easily during your meeting through seamless integration with Microsoft 365. Meeting chats allow you to have conversations during the meeting and keep future updates in context. Anyone who has a valid business or consumer email address can receive your invite and join easily using a link to the meeting.
