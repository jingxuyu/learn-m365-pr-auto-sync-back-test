  title: Test your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: "How can an Office Add-in open a dialog from Microsoft Excel?"
    choices:
    - content: "Define the dialog as an HTML page. Open the dialog using the `Office.context.openDialog(url, options, callback)` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `openDialog()` method doesn't exist. Use the `displayDialogAsync()` method to open the dialog."
    - content: "Define the dialog as an HTML page. Open the dialog using the `Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync(url, options, callback)` method."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct"
    - content: "Define the dialog as an HTML page and register it in the add-in's manifest file. Open the dialog using the `Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync(url, options, callback)` method."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Dialogs don't need to be registered in the add-in's manifest file."
  - content: "Office Add-ins can access values from the dialog in which of the following ways?"
    choices:
    - content: "Before opening the dialog, set the `callback` property to an event that will receive the arguments returned by the dialog."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "The `callback` property isn't a valid property on the dialog."
    - content: "When opening the dialog, specify the `DialogMessageReceived` event and pass in a callback method that will receive the dialog's return value."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct!"
    - content: "The Dialog API doesn't provide a way to return a value from the dialog. Developers can store a value in the `window.localStorage` object to share values between the dialog and add-in."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This option isn't correct; the Dialog API includes a callback option so the dialog can return a value to the add-in when the dialog is closed."
