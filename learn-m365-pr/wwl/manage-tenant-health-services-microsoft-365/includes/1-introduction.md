For many companies, Microsoft 365 is their first major public cloud effort. One of the challenges these companies face is learning how the IT team monitors Microsoft 365. For many companies, their monitoring systems aren't configured to monitor services outside of their local area network. So as part of your organizationâ€™s transition to Microsoft 365, you must learn how to monitor it using Microsoft 365 tools. In doing so, you should tie monitoring and health information into your existing monitoring tools.

The Microsoft 365 admin center includes a Health page that provides information on the health of your online services. It also includes information about any impending maintenance tasks that Microsoft plans to conduct.

In this module, you'll examine the monitoring features and functionality in Microsoft 365. You'll also be introduced to key concepts related to monitoring Microsoft 365.

After completing this module, you'll be able to: 

 *  Monitor your organization's Microsoft 365 service health in the Microsoft 365 admin center
 *  Develop an incident response plan to deal with incidents that may occur with your Microsoft 365 service
 *  Request assistance from Microsoft to address technical, pre-sales, billing, and subscription support issues
