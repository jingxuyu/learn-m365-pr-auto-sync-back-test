  title: Investigate and respond to data requests with Advanced eDiscovery and Advanced Audit
  description: The explosion of data creates challenges of finding the data you need when you need it for a variety of scenarios. Whether it is litigation, internal investigation, responding to a regulatory request or policy obligation – you need to be able to find relevant content, then refine and prepare that content in an efficient and effective manner. Business data across custodial and shared workspaces, devices and apps creates a challenge of effectively responding to data requests. Microsoft 365 has designed the Discover & Respond solution to help organizations to respond to requests with built-in suite-wide discovery & audit tools.
