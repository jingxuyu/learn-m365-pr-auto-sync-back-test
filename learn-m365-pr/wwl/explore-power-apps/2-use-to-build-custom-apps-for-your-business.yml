  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As Contoso's Enterprise Administrator, Holly Dickson is interested in implementing Power Apps. However, Holly wants Contoso's users to create apps where the app layout and the views and detail screens are determined by the components and based on the data structure. Which type of Power App should Holly use?"
    choices:
    - content: "Canvas app"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In canvas apps, the app layout and the views and detail screens aren't determined by the components, nor are they based on the data structure. Try again."
    - content: "Model-driven app"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Model-driven apps require a Common Data Service database and are built on top of the data modeled in that database environment. The app creator can determine the components (forms, charts, views, dashboards, and so on) to include in the app. However, the app layout and the views and detail screens are determined by the components and based on the data structure."
    - content: "Portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In portal apps, the app layout and the views and detail screens aren't determined by the components, nor are they based on the data structure. Try again."
