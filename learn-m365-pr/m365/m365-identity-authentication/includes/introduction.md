## Multi-factor Authentication 

About 81% of all successful attacks result from weak or compromised credentials. MFA helps safeguard access to data and applications. 
MFA requires two or more of the following authentication methods:

•	Something you know (typically a password)
•	Something you have (a trusted device that is not easily duplicated, such as a smart device or a badge)
•	Something you are (fingerprints, iris/retina scan, facial recognition)

Two-step verification creates a second security layer. Compromising multiple authentication factors presents a significant challenge for attackers because even if they manage to compromise a user’s password, they can’t use it without also possessing one of the additional authentication methods.
