Microsoft Teams helps your teams to continually share documents, status updates, and more, so you can all stay connected and up to date with each other, whether you're at your desk, or on the go using your mobile device. Collaboration isn't limited to your organization, Teams enables you to work together with anyone outside your organization in the same way. Users can access Microsoft Teams through their internet browser, or by installing Microsoft Teams on their computer or mobile device.
Features and functionalities
Microsoft Teams comes with many features and functionalities to help your users to connect and work together, including the following:

### Teams and channels

Microsoft Teams encourages your users to organize and collaborate across projects and workloads. It does this by introducing the following concepts to help teamwork:

- Teams. A team is a collection of people, their content, and the tools they need to work on projects. A team can be private, where users have to be invited. A team can also be public and open to anyone who wants to jump on. A team has a limit of up to 10,000 simultaneous members.
- Channels. A channel is where users can discuss and get hands-on with work. Channels facilitate features like tabs. Tabs make it possible for users to access and work on the same content. For instance, users in a team could have a channel with a tab for a specific report that they are all contributing to, and are working on together.

### Chat

Microsoft Teams comes with chat and sharing capabilities to help your users to collaborate easier through conversation, so your users can engage in discussion and stay up to date, including the following:

- One-to-one chat. Users can chat with other individual users for quick questions and private discussions. Additional users can also be added directly to a conversation.
- Group chat. Users can chat with other users as part of a group, for larger discussion and collaboration.
- Guests access. Users can chat and work with external users outside the organization.
- File sharing. Users can share files and documents with co-workers and external colleagues.
- Security. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- integration with other apps. Microsoft Teams can connect with other applications and services your users already use to collaborate. This way, they can collaborate using those apps and services from one central location. For example, your users can work on the same Excel file to build a report together.

### Voice and video calls

Microsoft Teams comes with different features and capabilities designed to let your users collaborate over voice or video calls and meetings.

- Meet anyone. Users can host one-to-one voice and video calls, calls and conferences with all members of a team, and live events for up to 10,000 people.
- Screen sharing. Users can decide what they want to show in a chat or meeting. For example, the whole desktop, a specific screen, or a specific application.
- Custom backgrounds. Users can blur their backgrounds or use custom backgrounds during meetings to avoid distractions, set the tone and ensure privacy.
- Share meeting notes. Users can share meeting recordings, and notes for audio, or voice calls in the meeting thread for a meeting.

### Security and compliance

Microsoft Teams is built on Microsoft 365 delivering enterprise-grade security and compliance capabilities with full manageability and granular controls:

- Encryption for Teams: all Teams data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Built-in Data Protection: Teams natively provides business-critical features like Data Loss Prevention and retention policies without requiring a 3rd party service like Zoom or Slack.
- Easily Manage Meetings and Guests: full control over policies that ensure guests are fully governed and meetings are limited to expected users only
- Centralized Management: the Microsoft 365 admin center enables IT to simplify management on the security, compliance, and identity controls governing your organization.
- Industry Leader: Teams supports more than 90 regulatory standards and laws including FedRAMP, SOC, HIPAA, and Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

### Remote collaboration and distance learning

More and more organizations are making the move to remote working. A single team can consist of members that are located in different geographical locations and time zones. Remote working can help organizations to save costs, improve productivity, and even save lives in global pandemics. Microsoft Teams facilitates remote working by encouraging your users to connect and empowering them to easily share ideas and workloads. Microsoft Teams is designed to help your teams to work together and stay connected as though they were in the same office. For example, a user can share their screen and other users can request control of their computer to help their colleague to resolve issues on their device.

Microsoft Teams is also designed to help improve learning through classroom-style experiences. Microsoft Teams makes it possible for your users to learn from a distance through virtual classrooms. Users can engage in lectures, one-to-one, or group discussions and share assignments and materials.
