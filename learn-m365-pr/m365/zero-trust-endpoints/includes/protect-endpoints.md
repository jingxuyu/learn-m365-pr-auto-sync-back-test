To protect endpoints, an organization must take a Zero Trust stance. This means you need to employ the principle of “never trust, always verify” across all endpoints, regardless of whether they belong to an organization, or they don't—such as endpoints owned by a contractor, a partner, or an employee.

To successfully secure endpoints, an organization should achieve the following:

- Cloud enforced security policies. This needs to cover endpoint security, app protection, device compliance, device configuration, and risk posture.
- The operating system (like Windows), as well as apps that run on devices are securely provisioned, configured, and kept up to date.
- Automatically and rapidly respond to security incidents and prevent organizational data from being extracted from endpoints.
- The presence of an access control system that only allows access to data through policy controls.

## Register endpoints with cloud identity providers

Organizations need to monitor and secure endpoints in a way that encompasses all the endpoints that are used by everyone. This means that your organization must be able to see and manage access to the endpoints that could be used to reach its resources.  

To achieve this, the organization's IT team can carry out the following steps: 

- Register all devices with identity providers.
- Require modern authentication.

Identity providers are dedicated solutions that make it possible to manage and control identities across an organization. Authentication tools facilitate and enforce authentication into endpoints. For example, the process a user goes through when they sign in to their device. Modern authentication tools enable organizations to remove the need for passwords altogether. This is referred to as passwordless authentication. With this method, users are expected to provide physical evidence to get access, like their fingerprint, or a proximity badge. This increases security because users must provide physical authentication, instead of passwords that can be hacked.

The combination of these measures enables organizations to control access. For example, through access policies that require specific conditions, like location of sign-in, device health status, and more. This helps ensure that each endpoint uses a trusted identity before access is granted to any resources.

## Grant access only to cloud-managed and compliant endpoints

Next, organizations need to limit access to endpoints that are compliant with their security requirements. If endpoints aren't compliant, it could lead to vulnerabilities, which might allow the endpoint to be compromised, and result in serious consequences.

Organizations can define requirements using compliance policies. For example, your organization could have a policy that requires devices to have the latest operating system version installed or have antimalware protection enabled. Your IT team can create compliance policies using cloud-based modern device management tools. These are dedicated solutions designed to enable your organization to manage all its devices from the cloud, from preconfiguration before first use, to monitoring and enforcing configuration and security requirements continuously.

Your organization should also set remediation rules when you create policies, in case an endpoint is noncompliant. Remediation rules describe how noncompliance issues should be resolved. For example, by alerting the user via email, blocking the endpoint, or applying a grace period after which the endpoint will be blocked if it isn't compliant.

## Use endpoint threat detection to monitor risk and control access

Next, your organization will need to implement threat detection for all endpoints to monitor risk across all devices. Endpoint threat detection is a way for your organization to identify threats, vulnerabilities, and security risks for the whole estate. Your organization can use threat detection solutions that collect all this information to provide insights into your security from a single view.

Threat detection solutions also allow your organization to respond promptly and effectively, using automated investigation and remediation for all endpoints. All of this means that endpoint threat detection enables you to take a strong security posture that protects all endpoints across the organization's estate.

Finally, your organization can also take information such as device risk, and feed it as a source of data to your endpoint compliance policies and access policies. This way, multiple points of data, such as device risk, will always inform what resources—like files or documents—are accessible to a device user, regardless of whether the device is owned by the organization, or an individual.
