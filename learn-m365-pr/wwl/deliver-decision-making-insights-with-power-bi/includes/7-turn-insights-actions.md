In order to truly build a culture around data, you not only need to find insights in your data, but you need to take action. With the Power Apps visual in Power BI, users can drive action directly from their Power BI reports, and seamlessly embed Power Apps as fully integrated components within a report. As users interact with Power BI, data is passed dynamically to the connected Power Apps, letting users take direct action.

In addition, the Power Automate visual in Power BI enabled dynamic process automation in Power BI, allowing users to trigger and change the flows based on data from Power BI.
