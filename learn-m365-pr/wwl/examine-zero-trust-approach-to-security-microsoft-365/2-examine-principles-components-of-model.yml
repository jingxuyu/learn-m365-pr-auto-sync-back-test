quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following items is an underlying principle that's part of the foundation of the Zero Trust model?"
    choices:
    - content: "Implicit trust"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Implementing Zero Trust requires you to move from an implicit trust model to one of verifying explicitly. Try again."
    - content: "Use most privileged access"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Use least (not most) privileged access is actually one of the underlying principles that's part of the foundation of the Zero Trust model. Try again."
    - content: "Assume breach"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Minimize blast radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and app awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted from start to finish. Use analytics to get visibility and drive threat detection and improve defenses."
