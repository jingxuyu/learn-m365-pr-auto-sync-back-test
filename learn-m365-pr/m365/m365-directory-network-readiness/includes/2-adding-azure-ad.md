Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoftâ€™s cloud-based identity and access management service which enables end users to sign in to access internal and external resources. Azure AD helps control access to your apps and app resources based on business requirements, such as requiring multi-factor authentication to access important internal resources or protecting user identities and credentials. Once you have Azure AD in place your users can sign in to and activate their Office 365 ProPlus apps, and you can use Microsoft Intune or Windows Autopilot deployment for automated deployment of apps and policy.

If your organization already uses Office 365 services such as Exchange Online or SharePoint Online, Microsoft Intune, or other Microsoft Online services, you are already using Azure Active Directory. For organizations not currently using Azure AD but have on-premises directories, the Azure AD Connect tool integrates Azure AD with your on-premises directories. This will enable end users to leverage a common identity when accessing both their on-premises resources and cloud services such as Office 365.
