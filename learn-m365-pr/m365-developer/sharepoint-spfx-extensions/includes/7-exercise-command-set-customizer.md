In this exercise, you'll create a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) command set extension that will display custom buttons in a SharePoint list.

Open a command prompt and change to the folder where you want to create the project.

Run the SharePoint Yeoman generator by executing the following command:

```shell
yo @microsoft/sharepoint
```

Use the following to complete the prompt that is displayed (*if additional options are presented, accept the default answer)*:

- **What is your solution name?**: SPFxCommandSet
- **Which baseline packages do you want to target for your component(s)?**: SharePoint Online only (latest)
- **Where do you want to place the files?**: Use the current folder
- **Do you want to allow the tenant admin the choice of being able to deploy the solution to all sites immediately without running any feature deployment or adding apps in sites?**: No
- **Will the components in the solution require permissions to access web APIs that are unique and not shared with other components in the tenant?**: No
- **Which type of client-side component to create?**: Extension
- **What type of client-side extension to create?**: ListView Command Set
- **What is your Command Set name?**: CommandSetDemo
- **What is your Command Set description?**: CommandSetDemo description

After provisioning the folders required for the project, the generator will install all the dependency packages by running `npm install` automatically. When NPM completes downloading all dependencies, test the default project provisioned by the generator.

## Define the command set buttons

The first step to create a command set extension is to define the buttons. Buttons are defined in the component's manifest file.

Locate and open the **./src/extensions/commandSetDemo/CommandSetDemoCommandSet.manifest.json** file. Replace the existing `items` property with the following JSON:

```json
"items": {
  "ONE_ITEM_SELECTED": {
    "title": { "default": "One Item Selected" },
    "iconImageUrl": "icons/request.png",
    "type": "command"
  },
  "TWO_ITEM_SELECTED": {
    "title": { "default": "Two Items Selected" },
    "iconImageUrl": "icons/cancel.png",
    "type": "command"
  },
  "ALWAYS_ON": {
    "title": { "default": "Always On" },
    "iconImageUrl": "icons/cancel.png",
    "type": "command"
  }
}
```

## Update the command set code

After defining the buttons, the next step is to write the code that implements the extension.

Locate and open the **./src/extensions/commandSetDemo/CommandSetDemoCommandSet.ts** file. Locate the interface `ICommandSetDemoCommandSetProperties` and update its members to the following code:

```typescript
messagePrefix: string;
```

Locate the method `onListViewUpdated()` in the `CommandSetDemoCommandSet` class and replace its contents with the following code. This code will show or hide two of the buttons depending on the number of items selected in the list.

```typescript
const one_item_selected: Command = this.tryGetCommand('ONE_ITEM_SELECTED');
if (one_item_selected) {
  one_item_selected.visible = event.selectedRows.length === 1;
}
const two_item_selected: Command = this.tryGetCommand('TWO_ITEM_SELECTED');
if (two_item_selected) {
  two_item_selected.visible = event.selectedRows.length === 2;
}
```

Locate the method `onExecute()` in the `CommandSetDemoCommandSet` class and replace its contents with the following code. This code controls what happens when custom button is selected.

```typescript
switch (event.itemId) {
  case 'ONE_ITEM_SELECTED':
    Dialog.alert(`${this.properties.messagePrefix} ONE_ITEM_SELECTED command checked; Title = ${event.selectedRows[0].getValueByName('Title')}`);
    break;
  case 'TWO_ITEM_SELECTED':
    Dialog.alert(`${this.properties.messagePrefix} TWO_ITEM_SELECTED command checked; Title = ${event.selectedRows[event.selectedRows.length-1].getValueByName('Title')}`);
    break;
  case 'ALWAYS_ON':
    Dialog.alert(`${this.properties.messagePrefix} ALWAYS_ON command checked. Total selected: ${event.selectedRows.length}`);
    break;
  default:
    throw new Error('Unknown command');
}
```

## Update the deployment configuration

Command sets, when deployed to production, are implemented by provisioning a new custom action that is associated with the custom script defined in the command set's bundle file.

Locate and open the **./sharepoint/assets/elements.xml** file. Update the `ClientSideComponentProperties` property on the `<CustomAction>` element, setting the values on the public properties on the command set:

```xml
ClientSideComponentProperties="{&quot;messagePrefix&quot;:&quot;[command_set_prefix]&quot;}"
```

## Test the command set

In a browser, navigate to a SharePoint Online modern site collection where you want to test the field customizer.

Select the **Site contents** link in the left-hand navigation. Select the list **Work Status** you created in a previous exercise:

![Screenshot of sample data in a list](../media/field-customizer-setup-list-03.png)

Locate and open the **./config/serve.json** file.

Copy in the full URL (including **AllItems.aspx**) of the list `serveConfigurations.default.pageUrl` property.

Locate the `serveConfigurations.default.customActions.properties` object.

Change the value of the `properties` object to the following JSON:

```json
"properties": {
  "messagePrefix": "[command_set_prefix]"
}
```

Run the project by executing the following command:

```shell
gulp serve
```

When prompted, select the **Load debug scripts** button.

Notice a new button in the toolbar after the page loads. When the **Always On** button is selected, a dialog appears that displays the message prefix defined in the public properties and the total number of items selected.

![Screenshot of the command set Always On button](../media/command-set-test-01.png)

Select one item in the list. Notice a new button appears. Select the button and notice how the dialog has changed:

![Screenshot of the command set One Item Selected button](../media/command-set-test-02.png)

Select a second item in the list. Notice a new button appears. Select the button and notice how the dialog has changed:

![Screenshot of the command set Two Item Selected button](../media/command-set-test-03.png)

Stop the local web server by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the console/terminal window.

## Summary

In this exercise, you'll create a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) command set extension that will display custom buttons in a SharePoint list.
