OneDrive is a service that enables the ability to store and access files from all your devices. It is a free cloud-based file service that is available to Microsoft account holders, with the option to purchase additional storage space. OneDrive is available to consumers for personal use to share and store documents, photos and music easily with friends and family, as well as access them from other devices, using a free Microsoft account. Microsoft 365 subscriptions include 1TB of storage per user or more depending on the plan. You can use OneDrive to save personal files in your private store or in your public store, so that you can share files with anyone.

OneDrive provides capabilities that allow it to be used in organizations as well. OneDrive, when used in an organization with certain Microsoft 365 plans, offers additional functionality, most notably, the option to store files in SharePoint. With many organizations concerned with how employees are sharing files and storing them in the cloud, OneDrive is particularly attractive for organizations. It has many data governance features that it inherits with SharePoint, yet it still provides a seamless experience in File Explorer that end users are already accustomed to.

One of the most important considerations for OneDrive should be with regard to managing user data. Organizations that set up OneDrive for users to store their data in solve three significant problems:

 -  **Data loss**. Storage devices, especially hard drives, eventually fail. A user losing their files can be incredibly devastating to them, and depending on the data, quite costly to an organization. Despite this high risk, people are notoriously bad at ensuring their critical data is backed up regularly. If user files are on OneDrive, not only are the files safe and secure, but they can be accessed on another device, while their device is being repaired or replaced.
 -  **Data migration**. Eventually a user's device is retired and replaced. If files are stored locally, a migration can be tedious. With user files in OneDrive, a new device with a standard image or configuration can be deployed, and combined with settings sync, replacing a device can be as simple as the user turning their new device on, signing in, and continuing to work.
 -  **Anywhere access**. As people rarely use only one device anymore, and the dramatic shift to work-at-home, employees and students being able to access their data using personal devices provides enormous flexibility, along with additional controls that organizations require to help protect that data.

### One Drive features

Below is a list of just some of the features that OneDrive offers:

 -  **Known Folder Move**. This redirects the common Windows known folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, and Camera Roll) to organizational Sharepoint storage. Users can continue with their daily work habits, while gaining the benefits of OneDrive.
 -  **OneDrive Files On-Demand**. You can choose the storage preferences for individual files and folders. You can either synchronize between local and cloud storage for scenarios like offline access, and or keep files online only, making them available on-demand, to help free up space on the local device, or choose to always retain a synchronized copy locally.
 -  **Files Restore**. The OneDrive Files Restore feature enables users to restore files to any point over the past 30 days. Users can view a histogram and select any point in time they wish to roll back to.
 -  **Recycle Bin**. OneDrive has a recycle bin similar to the one available on the Windows desktop. Deleted files are moved to the recycle bin and kept for a designated time before being permanently deleted. For work or school accounts, deleted files are purged after 93 days unless configured otherwise.
 -  **Auditing &amp; Reporting**. OneDrive has detailed reporting and auditing capabilities for files it stores as well as for those files stored through other services that use OneDrive for storage, such as Microsoft SharePoint. In addition, you can audit individual file actions, including downloads, renames, and views.
 -  **Encryption of data in transit and at rest**. OneDrive uses advanced data-encryption methods between your client and the data center, between servers in the data center, and at rest. At rest, OneDrive uses disk encryption through BitLocker Drive Encryption and file encryption to secure your data. Each file chunk is then randomly distributed among Microsoft Azure storage containers, making it highly improbably for attackers to access the file.

### Accessing OneDrive

There are several different methods and operating systems that you can use to access OneDrive. You can access it from any currently supported device, as well as through a web browser at http://www.OneDrive.com.

The OneDrive Sync client is already installed with Windows. OneDrive supports Windows 8.1 and higher, and the latest sync client can be installed from the download page of the OneDrive website. The OneDrive client is also available for supported versions of macOS, Android and iOS from their respective app stores.

With OneDrive, both scenarios can coexist. Users can manage and access their personal files stored in their personal OneDrive account, as well as work with business files managed with OneDrive using their work/school account.

> [!NOTE]
> Previously, OneDrive was two products, with two different clients for OneDrive and OneDrive for Business were two different clients. OneDrive now uses one client, OneDrive.exe. Older versions of Windows may have the previous OneDrive for Business client (groove.exe) installed. Administrators should consult OneDrive documentation for transition guidance.
