Microsoft Graph has built-in throttling to protect its resources from being overloaded and unable to respond to requests. When building applications that use Microsoft Graph, you want to ensure the application can react to throttling events. In addition, you should consider implementing strategies to avoid throttling altogether.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Explain how Microsoft Graph maintains resource health
- Identify when Microsoft Graph throttles requests
- Decide the appropriate pattern to address throttled requests
- Create queries that mitigate throttling scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of REST services and APIs
- Ability to develop with NET Core at the intermediate level
- Experience using Visual Studio Code at the beginner level
- Access to a [Microsoft 365 tenant](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program?ocid=MSlearn)
