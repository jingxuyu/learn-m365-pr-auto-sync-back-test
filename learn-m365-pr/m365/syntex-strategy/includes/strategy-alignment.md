With your roles and stakeholders in place, alignment is the next step. All team members need to be focused on a common strategy for how Syntex can help achieve your organizationâ€™s content understanding goals.

At your healthcare company, aligning on this strategy will require ensuring that both business outcomes and executive alignment are coordinated. Your organization will need to understand the fiscal and agility outcomes that will result from implementing Syntex, as well as equipping your executive team with a business case deck and overview of company readiness.

You will see how establishing business outcomes and equipping executives with the proper tools for alignment will support overall ease of implementation with SharePoint Syntex.

## How can you align your team on business outcomes for using SharePoint Syntex?

### Fiscal outcomes

Anticipating the fiscal outcomes of adopting Syntex is necessary, as spend and revenue is often top of mind for key stakeholders.  

One of the primary ways Syntex delivers ROI is through time saved and increased productivity. As a solution, Syntex provides more efficient and clear understanding of your documents, reducing time spent on making sense of content, giving overloaded team members time back in their day for more essential tasks.

Some questions to ask when determining potential fiscal outcomes:

- Which key areas do we want to see reduced spend?
- What content understanding processes do we want to expedite or make more efficient?
- By what margin do we want to reduce costs?

### Agility outcomes

Agility outcomes are focused on increasing your organizations ability to adapt quickly to an ever-changing and fluctuating market. Your business needs to be able to keep up with the innovation of your industry, including updating and creating new products and processes that meet market demand. This time to market considers how quickly your internal teams can produce solutions and services that are in demand.

For example, at Contoso Electronics, there are constantly evolving and growing customer expectations. These changes may be based around what components they can install to boost their business or how easily they can source the newest electronics. Increased agility is essential to meeting these customer expectations quickly.  

Syntex supports agility outcomes because it quickly and efficiently produces the document understanding and form processing models that your organization needs to understand content quickly and to apply what you have learned to potential products, new processes, and the overall growth of your business.

Some questions to ask when determining potential agility outcomes:

- What processes do we want to make more efficient?
- What do we need to understand from our content to keep up with demand?
- How can we measure increased agility? What are the KPIs to measure for agility?

### Outcome template

An outcomes template can be particularly helpful in defining what is needed to help actuate your business outcomes. The template is broken into six parts:

- **Stakeholder**: The party, or parties, who will be the most invested or will benefit the most in a particular business outcome and will need to support its development.
- **Business unit**: The department of your organization that is directly impacted by this outcome.
- **Business outcome**: The outcome itself, or otherwise, the specific measurement or result that you are trying to produce.
- **Business drivers**: The challenges that your organization is currently facing, as well as the desired opportunities of this particular outcome.
- **KPIs**: The key numbers that will help define how the change is measured.
- **Technical capability**: The technical skills and resources necessary to make your business outcome happen, such as solutions, services, applications, etc.

## How can you support executive buy-in and alignment on strategy for SharePoint Syntex?

### Business case deck

An on-hand, easily accessible PowerPoint deck can be the easiest resource for providing executives with the information they need to align on strategy. This deck should offer an overview of the initiative so that key executives can become convinced of and invested in the overall strategy. By understanding the strategy, leaders can more easily communicate it to the rest of the company.

Your deck can include:

- Overall goal
- Specific and measurable goals
- How goal aligns with larger company goals
- Key stakeholders
- Roles and responsibilities
- KPIs for measuring success
- Fiscal outcomes
- Agility outcomes
- Proposed rollout timeline

### Company readiness

When getting executive buy-in and aligning on strategy, it is important to also understand and communicate company readiness. Adoption of a new product or service will involve an onboarding process, as users become familiar with the solution and what it can do for them.  

Evaluating company readiness can involve asking questions such as:

- What training is required to onboard users? How long will this take?
- What tools and resources are available for training, such as videos and courses?
- What solutions do we already have in place that may be replaced by this new solution?
- Which stakeholders will be the primary points of contact for questions?
