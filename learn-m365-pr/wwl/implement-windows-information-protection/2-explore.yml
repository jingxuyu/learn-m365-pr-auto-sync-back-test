  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso provides its users with company-owned Windows 10 devices. These devices typically contain sensitive data. How does WIP protect this sensitive data should a device be lost or stolen?"
    choices:
    - content: "By blocking or warning users if they want to copy tagged corporate data into unsecure locations, or if apps try to access the data when they don't have permission to do so"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action is taken by WIP to prevent data leakage. It's not the WIP solution for device protection. Try again."
    - content: "By encrypting each device's hard drive using BitLocker"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Any device that contains sensitive data must be protected against theft or loss by encrypting its hard drives. Windows includes BitLocker for this scenario."
    - content: "By separating corporate apps and personal apps so that corporate data can be securely wiped on-demand"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action is taken by WIP to separate corporate vs. personal data. It's not the WIP solution for device protection. Try again."
