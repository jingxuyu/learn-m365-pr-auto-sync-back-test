Microsoft 365 Advanced eDiscovery builds on the existing set of eDiscovery capabilities in Microsoft 365. For example, you can use the eDiscovery feature in the Security &amp; Compliance Center to search for all data that may be relevant to a specific legal case. You can then analyze that data by applying the text analytics, machine learning, and the relevance/predictive coding capabilities of Advanced eDiscovery.

In this module, you'll examine the steps for setting up Advanced eDiscovery and managing cases by using the Microsoft 365 compliance center. You'll then learn about the various steps that must be completed to manage a workflow in Advanced eDiscovery. These steps include:

 -  Adding custodians to cases.
 -  Searching custodial data sources for relevant case data.
 -  Adding data to a review set.
 -  Reviewing and analyzing the data in a review set.
 -  Exporting and downloading the case data.

The module concludes with a review of the toolset provided in Advanced eDiscovery. These tools are designed to make the review process more manageable, efficient, and effective. It can be difficult for organizations to review all the collected documents in a review set when a large number of documents are involved. This set of tools provided by Advanced eDiscovery helps organizations analyze documents, and ultimately reduce the volume of documents to be reviewed without any loss in information. They can also help organize the documents in a coherent manner.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe Advanced eDiscovery.
 -  Configure permissions for users in Advanced eDiscovery.
 -  Create cases in Advanced eDiscovery.
 -  Search and prepare data for Advanced eDiscovery.
