IE mode on Microsoft Edge makes it easy to use all of the sites your organization needs in a single browser. It uses the integrated Chromium engine for modern sites, and it uses the Trident MSHTML engine from Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) for legacy sites.  In this module, you will learn how to configure Internet Explorer mode and Enterprise Mode to determine how and where sites will be rendered.

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain how to use Internet Explorer mode to enable legacy sites and line-of-business applications to run in Microsoft Edge.
- Configure Enterprise Mode Site List Manager to define the sites that will automatically run in IE mode.
- Enable enterprise mode in Microsoft Edge across the organization with group policy.
