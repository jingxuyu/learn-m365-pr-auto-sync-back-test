Cloud PCs can be an effective solution for many scenarios such as remote and contract workers. Azure Virtual Desktops and Windows 365 can provide a full desktop experience through a browser. They can be provisioned and deprovisioned quickly, and resized as needed to accommodate each user's needs. While the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure is managed through the Azure portal, Windows 365 cloud PCs can be configured and deployed directly in the Endpoint Manager admin center. Once the virtual clients are deployed, both solutions can be managed using the same methods as a physical PC.
