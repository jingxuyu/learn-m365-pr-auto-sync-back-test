Information governance is about being able to intelligently govern data across your environment, to reduce risk.

Information governance capabilities in Microsoft 365 include:

- **Manage data** - Use the [import service](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/importing-pst-files-to-office-365?view=o365-worldwide) to bulk-import PST files to Exchange Online mailboxes, or configure [unlimited archiving](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/unlimited-archiving?view=o365-worldwide) to give users more mailbox storage. Use [retention policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/retention-policies?view=o365-worldwide) to streamline administration about how your organization retains and deletes.
- **Monitor data** - The Label Activity Explorer, in the Security & Compliance Center, allows you to search for and view label activity. Which allows you to see what labels are being set and ensure data labels are being applied appropriately.
- **Manage inactive mailboxes** - Depending on your organization's retention requirements, you might need to retain mailbox content for a few months or years after employment ends, or you might need to retain mailbox content indefinitely. Regardless of how long you need to retain email, you can create [inactive mailboxes](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/inactive-mailboxes-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide) to retain the mailbox of former employees.
- **Records management** - Microsoft 365's [records management](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/compliance/records-management?view=o365-worldwide) solution helps you to meet regulatory and legal obligations. It also helps you to be more efficient by disposing of documents and data that is no longer required. Microsoft 365's record-management solution includes:
  - Labeling content as a record.
  - Migrating and managing your retention plans with file plan manager.
  - Establishing retention and deletion policies within the record label.
  - Triggering event-based retention.
  - Reviewing and validating disposition.
  - Proof of records deletion.
  - Exporting information about disposed items.
  - Setting specific permissions for records manager functions in your organization.
