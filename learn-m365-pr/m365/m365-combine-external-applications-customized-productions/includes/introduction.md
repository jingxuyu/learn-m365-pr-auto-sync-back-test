Microsoft 365 makes it easy to create engaging presentations that communicate a message to large audiences. You can integrate Microsoft Teams live events with hardware devices and software applications that support industry standards such as Network Device Interface (NDI) to achieve beautiful video and high-quality audio for your online event.

You've got a large on-line event coming up and you want to make it as professional and engaging as possible. You want to find out how to present to the largest audiences, use video from multiple sources, and create the best audio quality for your audience.

This module shows advanced features of Microsoft Teams for large and incisive presentations. You'll learn how to use NDI to generate multiple streams of video, use Teams Live Events for large audiences, and how to perfect the sound attendees hear.

This module includes content useful for event organizers, producers, presenters, and moderators.
