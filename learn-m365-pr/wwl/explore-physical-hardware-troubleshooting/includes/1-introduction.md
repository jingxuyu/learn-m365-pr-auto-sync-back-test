If a Windows device does not function properly, you can expect many different types of issues, which can vary from simply being annoying to users to being detrimental to your environment. For example, when a computer’s cooling fan produces a strange noise, a user’s productivity typically declines, and the hardware can overheat and fail. All data that the user did not save before the hardware failure will be lost.

This module provides an overview of troubleshooting hardware-related problems and discusses specific considerations for using USB and wireless devices on computers that are running Windows. It is important that you understand common hardware-related problems so that you can support your users.
