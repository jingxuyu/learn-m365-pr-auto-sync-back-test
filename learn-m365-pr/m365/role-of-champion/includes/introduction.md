If you work for an organization that's decided to start using OKRs with Viva Goals, all involved team members need to learn how to use and write OKRs, how to use the software, and how to incorporate these new practices into their daily work rhythms. OKR Champions take the lead in helping their teams navigate through this process successfully.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to define the role of an OKR Champion, name and describe the four key responsibilities of an OKR Champion, identify the different stages of an OKR rollout driven by an OKR champion, and identify the three timeframes for sending out resources and where to find these resources.
