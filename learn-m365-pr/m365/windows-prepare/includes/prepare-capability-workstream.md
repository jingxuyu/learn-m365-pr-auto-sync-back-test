During the Plan phase, you helped Woodgrove identify new capabilities to improve the environment. As the process manager, you now explain what's to be done in the capability workstream.

## Capability tasks

In the Plan phase, you determined the specific infrastructure and configuration changes that should be implemented to add new capabilities to the environment. You captured details of changes in the infrastructure and configuration remediation list. Now Woodgrove can implement the changes defined in the Plan phase. You explain that the company should carry out the following higher-level tasks:
- **Enable** capabilities across the environment by implementing the changes. For example, implement an update baseline. Microsoft gives administrations the ability to take advantage of thousands of settings so they can fine-tune their environment. Instead of having to go through these settings and configure them manually, Woodgrove administrators can use the update baseline to get an industry-standard configuration that they can further customize for their organization according to its unique requirements. Update baseline helps Woodgrove increase its update velocity and keep its devices secure with minimal impact on its users.
- **Validate** new changes to understand how they affect the wider environment.
- **Remediate** any potential issues that have been identified through validation.

## Assign tasks

As the process manager, you oversee and keep track of the status of capability tasks. You use the RACI model to create an example table that your organization can use for reference when assigning tasks to roles:

|*Task*  |Process manager  |End-user computing  |Application owner and developers |Operations|Security|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|*Enable*|Informed|Responsible|Informed|Informed|Informed|
|*Validate*|Informed|Informed|Informed|Responsible|Informed|
|*Remediate*|Informed|Responsible|Informed|Consulted|Informed|
