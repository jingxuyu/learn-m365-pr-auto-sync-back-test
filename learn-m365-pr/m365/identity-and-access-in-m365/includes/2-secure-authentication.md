Passwords are problematic. Users are expected to remember complex passwords for a variety of different accounts, both personal and for work. Issues with passwords include:

- Strong passwords can be difficult to remember
- Users often reuse passwords on multiple different sites
- Server breaches can expose symmetric network credentials (passwords).
- Passwords are subject to replay attacks.
- Users can inadvertently expose their passwords due to phishing attacks. 

This poses a significant security risk as once bad actors get ahold of compromised passwords, they can likely log into multiple sites. Most breaches are a result of compromised passwords. But what if we could remove passwords altogether? Microsoft 365 solutions include password replacement options to help reduce risk.

**Windows Hello**. In Windows 10, Windows Hello for Business replaces passwords with strong two-factor authentication on PCs and mobile devices. This authentication consists of a new type of user credential that is tied to a device and uses a biometric or PIN. Windows Hello for Business lets user authenticate to an Active Directory or Azure Active Directory account. 

**Microsoft Authenticator**. Passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised. The Microsoft Authenticator app helps you sign-in to your accounts if you use two-factor verification. Two-factor verification helps you to access your accounts more securely, especially while viewing sensitive information. Because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised, two-factor verification is an additional security step that helps protect your account by making it harder for other people to break in.

You can use the Microsoft Authenticator app in multiple ways, including:
- **Two-factor verification**. The standard verification method, where one of the factors is your password. After you sign-in using your username and password, you can either approve a notification or enter a provided verification code.
- **Phone sign-in**. A version of two-factor verification that lets you sign-in without requiring a password, using your username and your mobile device with your fingerprint, face, or PIN.
