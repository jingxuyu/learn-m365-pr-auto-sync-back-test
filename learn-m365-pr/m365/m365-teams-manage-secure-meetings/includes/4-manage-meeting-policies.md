Organizations often need to control the set of features that are available in Microsoft Teams meetings in order to focus the flow of meetings or to reduce the attack surface area. You can use meeting policies to remove features from meetings.

Suppose you are using Teams meetings in your software development organization and you've been asked to demo new functionality to external users. By default, your organization has restricted external users from controlling internal machines in Team meetings. You need to allow external users to try out your app's new features on your machine.

Here, you will learn how to use Teams policies to control what participants can do in meetings.

## What are meeting policies?

Meeting policies are used to define the features available to meeting organizers and participants. Meeting policies define the user experience before, during, and after a meeting. There are two types of meeting policies:

- **Global**. This policy applies to all Teams users in your organization and contains the default settings. You can amend the settings as required.
- **Custom**. A policy you define that can be assigned to specific users. A custom policy is used to override settings in the global policy.

To review or amend meeting policies, sign into the Microsoft Teams admin center and select **Meetings**, then **Meetings policies** from the left menu bar. Select **Edit**, or the policy name.

Policy settings are implemented as per-organizer, per-user, or per-organizer and per-user:

- **Per-organizer**. Per-organizer policy settings apply to the meeting organizer and all participants. Meeting participants inherit the policy settings of the meeting organizer.
- **Per-user**. Per-user policies apply the restriction to the organizer and meeting participants.
- **Per-organizer and per-user**. These policies restrict meeting participants based on both their policy *and* the organizer's policy. For example, **Allow cloud recording** is a per-organizer and per-user policy. Turn on this setting to allow the meeting organizer and participants to start and stop a recording.

## Policy settings
Let's examine some of the settings that you can use in your meetings policies.

### General

## Custom policies

To create a custom policy, select **+ Add**. Give the policy a **name** and **friendly description** then set the policy options. A custom policy can be assigned to specific users, in contrast to the global policy, which applies to all users.

You might create a custom policy to limit the amount of bandwidth used for meetings by staff in one location. You would create a new custom policy named "Limited bandwidth" and disable the following settings:

Under **Audio and video**:

- Allow cloud recording - set to off.
- Turn off Allow IP video - set to off.

Under **Content sharing**:

- Screen sharing mode - set to disabled.
- Allow whiteboard - set to off.
- Allow shared notes - set to off.

You can then assign the custom policy to specific users. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, select **Users** from the left menu bar. Under **Assigned policies**, select **Edit** and assign the relevant policy for each section.
