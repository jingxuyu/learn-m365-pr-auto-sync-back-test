Skype for Business Online provides presence and instant messaging information, enabling users to identify whether people are available and then chat, call, and video conference with each other. By using Skype for Business Online, you also can create online meetings with audio, video, and web conferencing, including integrating guest users from outside the organization. You can implement multiparty high-definition (HD) video with hardware that supports this capability. 
Skype for Business Online is available as part of most Microsoft 365 subscriptions.
