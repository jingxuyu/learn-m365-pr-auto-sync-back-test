This module examined how Microsoft 365 Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies can use classification properties or item properties to identify sensitive items in a document. For example, organizations can use:

 -  Windows Server File Classification infrastructure (FCI) properties
 -  SharePoint document properties
 -  third-party system document properties

The module explored how a DLP policy can identify documents that have a property set to specific values, such as High or Medium. You learned that when this condition is true, the policy will take an action such as blocking access to those files. The same policy can have another rule that takes a different action if the property is set to Low, such as sending an email notification. The examples presented in this module showed how DLP integrates with Windows Server FCI. The goal of this integration is to protect Office documents uploaded or shared to Microsoft 365 from Windows Server-based file servers.

This module also examined how to create a DLP policy that uses an FCI classification property. You walked through the process of creating the managed property in SharePoint Online. You then reviewed the process of creating the actual policy with a Security and Compliance Center PowerShell session.
