In the introductory scenario, you as the digital transformation analyst wanted to track employee adoption of Microsoft Teams. You wanted to determine how it was being used in different areas of your organization.

The Teams insights dashboard provides a way to visualize how the organization is transitioning to Microsoft Teams. You can see its usage over time and by department, call and messaging metrics by group, and Teams versus email over time. The reports you can generate reveal many opportunity areas for helping employees make meaningful changes.

It would be hard to build a similar report from scratch without Workplace Analytics data. If you or your business analyst has approval to access raw Microsoft 365 data, you would need to determine how to gather it for all users. Then you'd need to make sense of the data, calculate business metrics, and maintain employee privacy and security. And only then could you build your Teams insights report.

Now that you've finished this module, you should be able to:
  
- Explain what the Workplace Analytics Power BI Teams insights dashboard is, and why it provides an important perspective.
- Run queries, load the data, and select your settings.
- Interpret the results in the dashboard.
