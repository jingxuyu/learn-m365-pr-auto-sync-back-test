# Sign in your app using Microsoft Graph Toolkit Login Component

To load data from Microsoft 365, you'll need to sign in your application to Microsoft Graph.

Upon completing this module, you'll learn how to authenticate your application to access Microsoft Graph using the login component of the toolkit.

## What is the purpose of adding Login component in your application

You can add login component of the toolkit to implement login and logout functionality and all the authentication logic associated with it using one line of code in the application.
Initialize a toolkit provider to use the login component in your application.

## What are providers in Microsoft Graph Toolkit

Providers simplify implementing authentication for your application and make calls to Microsoft Graph using the JavaScript client SDK.
Initialize a provider before you use any other toolkit component. However, they can also be used on their own, without components to implement authentication for your application.
There are different providers, depending on the platform in which you're using the toolkit components in your application. Here you'll set up the widely used MSAL provider.
