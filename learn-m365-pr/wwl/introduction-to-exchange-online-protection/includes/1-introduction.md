Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is a cloud-based email filtering service that helps protect organizations against spam and malware. It includes features to safeguard organizations from messaging-policy violations. EOP can simplify the management of an organization's messaging environment. It can also alleviate many of the burdens that come with maintaining on-premises hardware and software.

Microsoft 365 tenants that have mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online rely on the Exchange Online Protection service to route inbound and outbound mail. EOP is also instrumental in protecting organizations from phishing, spoofing, spam, and malware. EOP provides email security through a combination of techniques, including:

 -  IP and sender reputation
 -  heuristics
 -  spam filtering
 -  malware filtering
 -  machine learning
 -  filtering for phishing and spoofing

Together, EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provide a complete solution for protecting users against cyberthreats originating in email. While most of this learning path training focuses on the benefits and implementation of Microsoft Defender for Office 365, you'll begin in this module by reviewing the capabilities of EOP.

In this module, you'll examine how mail flows through EOP. You'll also explore the technologies EOP uses to block spam, bulk email, and malware before mail arrives in usersâ€™ mailboxes. This module further investigates EOP to see how it protects organizations from phishing and spoofing. EOP includes techniques that administrators can implement to provide further protection.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Exchange Online Protection (EOP) analyzes email to provide anti-malware pipeline protection.
 -  List several mechanisms used by EOP to filter spam and malware.
 -  Describe other solutions administrators may implement to provide extra protection against phishing and spoofing.
 -  Implement the Spoof Intelligence feature.
