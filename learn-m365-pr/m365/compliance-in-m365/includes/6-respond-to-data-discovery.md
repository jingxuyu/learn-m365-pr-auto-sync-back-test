Microsoft 365 provides built-in, suite-wide search and discovery tools to help reduce your risk and exposure of multiple copies of data in multiple places. 

You can use Advanced eDiscovery to review and redact content prior to export to ensure that only the most relevant data is being shared, and that any business confidential pieces of that data are redacted.

These tools can help significantly reduce the costs of eDiscovery. In fact, at Microsoft, while average data per custodian has grown 20x, the cost (and expense) per custodian of eDiscovery has been reduced 85% with the use of these built-in capabilities.

Watch this video to learn more about how Advanced eDiscovery can help you hold, search, refine, analyze, review, and export your relevant content.
