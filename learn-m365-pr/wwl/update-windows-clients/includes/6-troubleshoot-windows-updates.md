2.  Right-click the suspect update, and then select **Uninstall**.

#### Uninstall drivers

If you suspect a driver to be problematic, you can uninstall the driver. To uninstall an unwanted driver:

1.  Open **Device Manager**.
2.  Locate the device driver with the problem driver installed, right select it, and then select **Uninstall**.
3.  In the **Uninstall** dialog box, select the **Delete the driver software for this device** check box, if available.
