  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following attributes is a feature of shared mailboxes?"
    choices:
    - content: "Shared mailboxes can provide a generic email address to field customer inquiries"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Shared mailboxes provide a generic email address, such as marketing@contoso.com or sales@contoso.com, to field customer inquiries."
    - content: "A shared mailbox can have its own username and password"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. A shared mailbox doesn't have its own username and password like a User mailbox does. You can't use Outlook, Outlook Web App, Exchange ActiveSync, Exchange Web Services (EWS), or any other Exchange protocol to sign into a shared mailbox. Instead, you must be granted permission to the shared mailbox, at which point you can access it by using Outlook or Outlook Web App. Try again."
    - content: "Shared mailboxes are supported on mobile devices"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Shared mailboxes aren't supported on mobile devices. To access a shared mailbox from a mobile device, you must use Outlook on the Web. Once a user is granted permission to the shared mailbox, it will automatically be added to the user’s Outlook profile and opened alongside the user’s primary mailbox. Try again."
