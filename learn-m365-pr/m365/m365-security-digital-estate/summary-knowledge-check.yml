      choices:
      - content: "Automatic"

        explanation: "Incorrect. With automatic, documents are automatically classified, labeled, and protected according to the data they contain."
      - content: "Required"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Required is not a user classification experience."
      - content: "Recommended"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. With recommended, documents are automatically classified and labeled according to the data they contain, but the user can change the classification."
      - content: "Reclassification"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Reclassification allows the end user to reclassify the data or remove the label."

      choices:
      - content: "Automatic"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Correct.  With automatic, the documents are automatically classified, labeled, and protected without allowing the end user to reclassify."
      - content: "User-set"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. User-set would allow the end user to classify the document manually to a level other than classified."
      - content: "Recommended"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. With recommended, the end user could change the document to a level other than classified."
      - content: "Reclassification"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Reclassification would allow the end user to reclassify the data, or worse remove the label."
        
      
    - content: "Which department should you first work with to identify data protection standards, regulations, and requirements?"
      choices:
      - content: "IT"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. IT should work with the surrounding departments to understand business requirements and regulations before defining IT-led classifications."
      - content: "Human Resources (HR)"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. Although HR may have its own standards and requirements, this is not the first place to start."
      - content: "Information protection steering committee"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Incorrect. A steering committee or champion team is a great solution to drive data protection, but you should consult them to help create labels and standards across all departments."
      - content: "Legal"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. The legal department typically has worked through your organizationâ€™s data sensitivity and protection regulations. Partnering with the legal department helps IT scope out the baseline requirements and standards."
