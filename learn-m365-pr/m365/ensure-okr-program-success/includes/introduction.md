The long-term success of any OKR program goes beyond the practical logistics required for launching it. Beyond knowing *how* to do OKRs, individuals will need support sustaining the change and incorporating OKRs to their daily work rhythms. OKR Champions can support their teams by learning three strategies for ensuring program success: cultivate psychological safety, establish business rhythms, and make it visible.

Imagine you've successfully launched the OKR program at your company. You're a few months in and energy around OKRs is beginning to wane. How do you keep people on board? How do you maintain momentum? As the OKRs' program really delivers results over a longer timeline, ensuring long-term program success is essential for OKR Champions.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to define psychological safety and identify two ways to cultivate it, identify the three cycles of business rhythms and know how to execute them, and identify three ways to make OKRs visible to your team.
