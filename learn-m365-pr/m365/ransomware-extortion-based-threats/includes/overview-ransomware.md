Ransomware is where a criminal installs software onto your computer, which prevents you from using it and then demands money from you in order that you can access your computer again. The ransomware can be installed so that it locks an entire company out of some or all its systems or prevents access to certain files. Some ransomware can take extracts of data and then a threat is made to make the data public should the ransom not be paid.

You'll also hear the term malware mentioned in the module. Malware is ransomware that is downloaded onto computers or the computer system that prevents access.  To summarize, malware locks the computer and by demanding a ransom the attack becomes a ransomware attack.

Another term you'll read about or hear in the news is **ransomware actors,** which refers to the cybercriminals or groups that use ransomware to disrupt and then extort money from individuals or organizations; in this module we'll use the term **cybercriminal**.

Ransomware attacks take different forms and can include any or all of the following:

- Ransomware is downloaded onto a machine and extracts data; the criminal then demands a ransom to prevent confidential information being released to the public.
- Ransomware is downloaded and changes file names so users can't open files, which prevents normal day-to-day jobs being carried out. A ransom is demanded to obtain access to the files.
- Ransomware is downloaded that locks users out of their computers completely making any work impossible and effectively shuts down a company. A ransom is demanded to allow the company to continue to operate.

The impact on users and companies is significant:

- Attacks on hospitals can put lives at risk if records can't be accessed.
- Attacks on healthcare organizations can put lives at risk due to the increasing number of wireless devices that help sustain life such as pacemakers and insulin pumps.
- Attacks on educational institutions can prevent access to important educational resources.

If you also consider the potential impact of the release of patient or pupil records, or the risk to life, the damage can be devastating for the business or individual that is being targeted.  The negative publicity surrounding a company not being able to trade can have huge financial implications.

Companies are faced with stark and difficult decisions, they either pay the ransomware and hope they get all their data back or risk negative implications such as:

- The loss of valuable data.
- The loss of reputation/sales/future orders.
- Face the risk of a leak of confidential data into the public domain.
- Potential loss of life if wireless data is disrupted.

It's important to remember that you're dealing with cybercriminals so there are no guarantees; often some data remains inaccessible or is sold on the black market even though a ransom has been paid.

## The growth of ransomware as an industry

As the internet has become more accessible so the potential for installing ransomware has also increased, but the problem isn't a new one and started when computers were first being used.

### 1989 - AIDS Trojan

The first recorded ransomware attack occurred as far back as 1989 when 20,000 floppy disks containing a healthcare program for AIDS patients were distributed to attendees at a conference. The disks were infected with malware, which only activated after users had used the program 90 times; at that point the system locked, and a ransom demand was displayed on the screen.

### Turn of the century

With the change from dial up services to broadband, many more users were using the internet opening new opportunities for criminals wanting to exploit vulnerable people and companies. Several notable cases hit the headlines which either:

- Prevented access to files on a user's device and forced them to purchase items at an online store in return for the code to unlock their files.
- Infected computers when users opened an email attachment that pretended to be a job application.

### 2008

The invention of Bitcoin introduced a way for criminals to easily hide money and the number of ransomware cases has steadily increased from this point onwards. The severity of attacks started to increase with whole systems being locked down instead of just user files.

### 2012 - Ransomware-as-a-service

Within the criminal environment, ransomware started to become available to purchase via a license, a process called Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) meaning other criminals without the same degree of technical ability could also start launching attacks. This led to an increase in large scale attacks and introduced some malware that is still around today such as CryptoWall and Locky, which keep evolving, making it harder to detect, and maximizing the impact on the victim.

### Current landscape

Extracting ransom via cyberattacks is now a complete business model, where criminal organizations run large call centers to handle ransom payments, and target large businesses and high-profile individuals to maximize payouts. Small businesses and individuals are still targeted so no one is safe from attack. The Covid pandemic has pushed many users to remote working meaning more companies are at risk as more traffic goes through the Internet. It's vitally important that all businesses ensure they follow all recommendations to minimize any threat of attack.

However, the continued increase in the number and scale of attacks has brought the issue more to the attention of law enforcement agencies who are spending more on targeting the attackers and having some very limited success.
