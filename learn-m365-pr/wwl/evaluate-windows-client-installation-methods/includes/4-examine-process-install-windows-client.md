The process of deploying a Windows operating system is simpler today than it has been in the past. The person who performs the deployment has fewer decisions to make. However, those decisions are critical to the success of the deployment.

A typical manual installation of Windows involves performing the following procedure:

1.  Connect to the installation source. Options for this include:
    
     -  Insert a DVD or USB Media containing the Windows installation files, and boot from the DVD.
     -  Perform a PXE boot, and connect to a Windows Deployment Services server.
2.  On the first page of the **Windows Setup Wizard**, select the following choices:
    
     -  Language to install
     -  Time and currency format
     -  Keyboard or input method
3.  On the second page of the **Windows Setup Wizard**, select **Install now**. You also can use this page to select **Repair Your Computer**. You use this option if an installation has become corrupt, and you are no longer able to boot into Windows.
4.  On the **License Terms** page, review the terms of the operating system license. You must choose to accept the license terms before you can proceed with the installation process.
5.  On the **Which Type Of Installation Do You Want** page, you have the following options:
    
     -  **Upgrade.** Select this option if you have an existing installation of Windows that you want to upgrade to Windows 10 or Windows 11. You should launch upgrades from within the previous version of Windows rather than booting from the installation source.
     -  **Custom.** Select this option if you want to perform a new installation.
6.  On the **Where do you want to install Windows** page, choose an available disk on which to install Windows. You can also choose to repartition and reformat disks from this page. If you want to do this from the command line, you can press Shift+F10 to access a command prompt. When you select **Next**, the installation process will copy files and reboot the computer several times.
7.  On the **Set up for you, so you can get going fast** page, select **Use Express settings**.
8.  If the computer does not have Internet access, you might see a page telling you something went wrong. Select **Skip** to continue the installation. The installation will then skip to number 12 in this list, **Create an account for this PC**.
9.  On the **Who owns this PC?** page, select **This device belongs to my company**, and then select **Next**. Depending on your choice in this step, the installation will take two different directions. If you indicate that this is a private computer, the setup program asks you to sign in with your Microsoft account or create a new one or a local account. If you indicate that this is a company computer, the setup program asks you to sign in with your Microsoft 365 account or create a local account. Depending on which edition of Windows you install, you may or may not see this page.
10. On the **Heads up** page, select **Continue**.
11. On the **Letâ€™s get you signed in** page, select **Skip this step**.
12. On the **Create an account for this PC** page, type the username you want to use together with a password and a password hint, and then select **Next**.
13. This concludes the installation of Windows client. You have signed in and installed the built-in universal apps. It will take a few minutes before you see the desktop.
