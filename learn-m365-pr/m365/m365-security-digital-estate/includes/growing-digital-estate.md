The boundaries of protected data have progressed through three main phases.

- **On-premises.** You have control over data within your network. Your data protection is only as strong as your network and physical building security.
- **Mobile and cloud.** The advent of cloud assets and managed devices, such as phones, tablets, and mobile laptops, has expanded data boundaries. Mobile device management solutions help you control data but not when it moves outside of your managed devices.
- **Everywhere else.** You lose control over your data once it's shared outside your environment. This can occur when a user copies a sensitive file onto their USB drive to work on at home, or perhaps sends the document to their personal email account.
