## What makes up a Microsoft Teams app?

Custom apps built for Microsoft Teams consist of three primary pieces.

* **The Microsoft Teams client.** blah
* **Your app package.** blah
* **Your web and app services.** blah

## How can I distribute my app?

You have three options for distributing your custom Microsoft Teams app, depending on your target audience. 

* **Upload your app for an individual or team.** blah
* **Publish your app to your organizational app catalog.** blah
* **Publish your app to the public App Store.** blah

When distributing your app you need to take into consideration not just your desired audience, but the IT policies in place in the organization you want to share your app with. Each organization has complete control over determining which publishing options are available, and which apps are available in the app store.
