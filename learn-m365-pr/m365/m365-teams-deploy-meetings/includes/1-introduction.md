Teams provides a great collaboration experience for your organization, and most companies find that the default settings work for them. Teams allows you to improve the meetings experience for your employees by supporting dedicated conferencing hardware. You can also change how meetings are recorded and the policies that control who can attend them.

Suppose you're an administrator for a large multinational organization in the software development sector. Audio/video conferencing has been handled in the past by a third-party system that users dialed into. Now, you want to use Teams to replicate that functionality and integrate it with file management, chat, and so on. You've put together a plan for how you'll deploy Microsoft Teams meetings across the organization and support both office-based and home working users in multiple countries.

In this module, you will learn how to set up user accounts for access to meetings and how to configure advanced meetings features, such as recording and video interoperability.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to set up users for Teams meetings.
