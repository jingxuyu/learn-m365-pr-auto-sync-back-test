After developing a file plan, an organization must plan how its active SharePoint documents will become records. An organization has one of two choices. It can either manually or automatically convert active documents to records.

### Creating records manually

When the site collection administrator enables in-place records management, they can select the users who'll manage the company's records. These users will declare and undeclare records, and edit or delete documents after they become records. Users with the necessary permissions can then explicitly declare a document in a SharePoint library to be a record by editing the documentâ€™s compliance details.

### Creating records automatically

Records can be created automatically based upon the rules defined within retention policies. A retention policy specifies actions to take on documents at certain points in time. These actions occur automatically without user intervention.

When in-place records management is enabled for a site, you can create a policy that declares a document to be a record. You can also specify different retention policies for active documents and records.

For example, one policy could be created that declares an active document to be a record two years after the document was created. A second policy could then be created that deletes a record seven years after it was declared to be a record.
