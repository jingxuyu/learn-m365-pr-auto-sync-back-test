You will be partnering with your cloud service provider to make sure your data and services are only accessed by the people who should use them, and that private information stays private   and protected. This module introduces you to basic things to keep in mind as you evaluate what your cloud service provider will do.


## Understand privacy

When you depend on cloud service providers, you are relying on them to keep your data safe. This could be from loss, theft, or misuse by third parties, including other customers, employees of the hosting company, and even users within your own organization. As more and more customers are relying on cloud service providers to keep their data safe, cloud services raise unique privacy questions for businesses. This is because organizations have legal obligations to ensure the privacy of their employees, customers, and clients. 
Laws prohibit some data from being used for a reason other than the purpose for which the data was originally collected. In addition, when you collect and store data in the cloud, you are subject to legal requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), just as if you were storing data on premise. If you work with European companies or customers, you must also adhere to EU privacy laws. 

So, what does this mean for a company considering adopting cloud computing? You need to ensure your cloud service provider is helping safeguard privacy by: 

- **Reading the cloud service provider’s privacy notices.** These specify how data is accessed by users and how it can be deleted or modified. In addition, you need to know where data is actually kept, how data is backed up and how often, and where the backups are stored. In some instances, there may be data that must remain in a certain geopolitical region  
- **Considering how the cloud service provider handles disaster recovery and organizations’ continuity.** You must ensure that backups are being created on a regular basis, data is being replicated to another site, and that the services are duplicated on another site. 
- **Considering how the hosting company handles security breaches.** Also, check the disclosure policy to see how quickly your cloud service provider will disclose a breach to you, in the event one occurs."  There are laws that require you to be informed promptly of any breaches. 


## Understand compliance
Many organizations have regulations and policies that they must comply with to operate in various industries. For example, companies working in the health industry have to follow HIPAA. These policies can be quite complex based on the type of industry, geographical location of the organization, and company-based policies. Further complicating matters is the fact that legal and regulatory bodies might change the responsibilities of both the cloud-computing tenants and providers.  

An organization that doesn't protect its data could be subject to a fine by one or more government or industry regulatory bodies. Some of these fines can be substantial, crippling a small or mid-sized organization. 

Laws or regulations typically specify who within an organization should be held responsible for data accuracy and security. For example, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act designates the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) as having joint responsibility for the financial data, while the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act specifies that the responsibility for security lies within the entire board of directors. These both contrast with the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which requires a specific individual to be accountable for the information security program within a company. 

All these regulations pertain to cloud computing. If you store any of your data in the cloud, you must ensure that your cloud service provider follows all legal and regulatory requirements. Remember, it’s still your responsibility to ensure these requirements are met, so do your due diligence before signing any contract. Then after the contract is signed, take steps to ensure that compliance is maintained to protect your company and your customers.
