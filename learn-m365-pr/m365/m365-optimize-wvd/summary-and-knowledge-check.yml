   title: Check your knowledge
   questions:
   - content: "Which of these steps is not part of creating an FSLogix profile?"
     choices:
     - content: "Create an Azure storage account with a file share"
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. FSLogix profiles store user-assigned virtual disks in the file share in Azure."
     - content: "Create a new role in Azure AD to read and write in Azure storage"
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. You need a new role in Azure AD to read and write in Azure storage so users can access and modify the virtual disks that contain their user profile."
     - content: "Install FSLogix software in Windows Virtual Desktop gallery images"
       isCorrect: true
       explanation: "Correct. FSLogix software is preinstalled in the gallery images. If you use your *own* image, you'll need to install the FSLogix software yourself to use its capabilities."
   - content: "OneDrive Known Folder Move can backup and synchronize files located in a user’s Documents, Desktop, Downloads, and Pictures folders."
     choices:
     - content: "True"
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. OneDrive Known Folder Move can only backup and synchronize files located in a user’s Documents, Desktop, and Pictures folders. The Downloads folder is not an option."
     - content: "False"
       isCorrect: true
       explanation: "Correct. OneDrive Known Folder Move can only backup and synchronize files located in a user’s Documents, Desktop, and Pictures folders. The Downloads folder is not an option."
   - content: "Automated scaling in Windows Virtual Desktop is primarily used for which of the following reasons?"
     choices:
     - content: "To increase virtual disk storage when users get close to reaching the limits in a virtual machine."
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. Automated scaling is used to provision and deprovision virtual machines in order to save costs based on user demands or usage patterns. Vertically scaling virtual machine size is possible, but not the primary reason for autoscaling in WVD."
     - content: "Automated scaling is used to increase service uptime and availability"
       isCorrect: false
       explanation: "Incorrect. Virtual machine availability sets are used for this purpose, but automated scaling in WVD is used to provision and deprovision virtual machines in order to save costs based on user demands or usage patterns."
     - content: "To save costs by matching the number of running virtual machines to user demand"
       isCorrect: true
       explanation: "Correct. Automated scaling is used to provision and deprovision virtual machines in order to save costs based on user demands or usage patterns. The automation can be based on a schedule to match common business hours or actual resource utilization."
