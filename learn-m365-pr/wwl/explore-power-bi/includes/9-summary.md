This module examined Power Business Intelligence, otherwise known as Power BI. It's is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Whether your data is a simple Microsoft Excel workbook or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize (or discover) what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

You learned in this module that Microsoft Power BI can be broken down into the following basic building blocks:

 -  Datasets
 -  Visualizations
 -  Reports
 -  Dashboards
 -  Tiles

Starting with these building blocks, you learned how to build a Power BI report and dashboard that meets your exact business needs and integrates and interacts with your business data. Like the other product components of Microsoft Power Platform, Power BI supports custom connectors that are designed for new data sources with custom data extensions. Some custom connectors are certified and distributed by Microsoft as certified connectors.

After learning how to build a Power BI report and dashboard, you then learned how to share them with other users. Sharing is a good way to give selected people access to dashboards and reports so they can view and interact with the shared content. Dashboards and reports can be shared from most places in the Power BI service, such as Favorites, Recent, My Workspace, and Shared with me (if the owner allows it). Users can also share from other workspaces if they have the Admin, Member, or Contributor role in the workspace. A Power BI Pro license is required to share content. Recipients also need Power BI Pro licenses, unless the content is in a Premium capacity.
