User adoption of Microsoft Search ensures your organization is getting a return on the time and effort spent optimizing and deploying the search experience. This module outlines the ready-to-share and customizable content available, and actions you can take to evangelize Microsoft Search. Keeping your work or school answer content current is also an important task. We’ll go over how to review and publish suggested bookmarks and share tips for managing seasonal content. In the last part of this module, we’ll cover how to access and monitor Microsoft Search usage reports. The insights generated from these reports can help you gauge how search is performing in your organization and guide actions to improve it.

The Search admin is considering conducting some sort of launch event or training and knows they’ll have to implement a communication campaign.
