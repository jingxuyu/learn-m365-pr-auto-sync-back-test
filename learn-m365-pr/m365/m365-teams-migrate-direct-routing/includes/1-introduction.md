Direct Routing allows you to connect an existing phone infrastructure to the Microsoft Teams service. Using a certified Session Border Controller (SBC) you can route calls from your Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to Microsoft's Phone System.

Suppose you're the lead administrator for Teams at Contoso. You've been asked to begin planning your migration of telephony service to Microsoft Teams. You already have Teams rolled out for internet-based communications, but your telephony services are running on an on-premises Skype for Business Server. You want to ensure as smooth a migration as possible.

In this module, you'll learn how to prepare for migration of your phone system to Teams Direct routing.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe how to prepare an on-premises Skype for Business Server telephony system for migration to Teams Direct Routing.
- Explain how to migrate a telephony system to Teams Direct Routing.
- Describe how Teams connects calls by using Dynamic Routing during the migration.
- Demonstrate how administrators complete a migration to Teams Direct Routing.
