SaaS, PaaS and IaaS each contain different levels of cloud services. You may easily use a combination of these types of services. For example, you could use Office 365 (SaaS) for your organization’s email and file sharing, and in Azure, you could host VMs (IaaS) to run Linux applications and use Azure SQL Database (PaaS) to store your data. With the cloud’s flexibility, you can use any combination that provides you with the results you need to run your organization.
