    - content: "Change the MX record to Microsoft 365"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. After the IMAP migration is complete, you must change the DNS MX record of all your SMTP domains so that new email is delivered to Microsoft 365. As a best practice, you should wait a day or two to ensure the DNS settings are propagated to all the other SMTP servers on the Internet so that no messages are transferred to your old mail server."
