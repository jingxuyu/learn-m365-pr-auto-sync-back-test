title: Implement data classification of sensitive information
summary: This module introduces you to data classification in Microsoft 365, including how to create and train classifiers, view sensitive data using Content explorer and Activity explorer, and implement Document Fingerprinting.
abstract: |
  By the end of this module, you'll be able to:
  - Explain the benefits and pain points of creating a data classification framework.
  - Identify how data classification of sensitive items is handled in Microsoft 365.
  - Understand how Microsoft 365 uses trainable classifiers to protect sensitive data.
  - Create and then retrain custom trainable classifiers.
  - Analyze the results of your data classification efforts in Content explorer and Activity explorer.
  - Implement Document Fingerprinting to protect sensitive information being sent through Exchange Online.
