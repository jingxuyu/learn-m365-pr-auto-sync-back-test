    *Search for Edge in the App Store, from Microsoft Endpoint Manager*

 

3) From the **Add app** screen select **Search the App Store**, then from the Search the App Store screen, enter **Microsoft Edge**. Select the **Microsoft Edge** from the list of options then press **Select**, as shown below.

4) Once the application is selected, the **Add app** screen displays. Admins will navigate through the different screens: 

	- Review **App Information** 

	- Apply **Scope tags** as needed 

	- On the Assignments screen assign the different iOS devices to which Microsoft Edge will be deployed, as on the **Assignments** screen 

	- Then **Review + Create**. Once the admin selects **Create**, Microsoft Edge will soon begin to appear on those devices
