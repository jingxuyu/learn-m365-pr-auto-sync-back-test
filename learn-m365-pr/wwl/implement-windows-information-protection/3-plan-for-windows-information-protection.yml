  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is planning Contoso's WIP implementation. Which of the following items should Holly consider during this planning process?"
    choices:
    - content: "Select untrusted apps that can bypass Contoso's WIP policy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can select trusted apps that can bypass the WIP policy. But untrusted apps should be blocked from corporate data access. Try again."
    - content: "Determine whether Contoso will use MDM or MAM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. WIP policies are created for MDM or MAM, but they don't support both at the same time. For example, a WIP policy configured for MDM but scoped for a group of users with MAM won't work."
    - content: "Identify which websites are untrusted so they can't access Contoso's corporate data"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Websites and networks are untrusted by default, including OWA. When planning Contoso's WIP implementation, Holly should define which websites are trusted to access Contoso's corporate data. Try again."
