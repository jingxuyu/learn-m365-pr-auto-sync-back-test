Most attacks follow a common process referred to within the security industry as the “Kill Chain.” Briefly, an attack follows a basic pattern and proceeds from one step to the next to achieve the wanted outcomes. This step-wise process can be defended against by implementing security measures on choke points in the chain. Since any step can be bypassed through various exploitation techniques, the best strategies apply defenses at every step along the chain.

The threat landscape across the globe has changed dramatically over the past several years with hackers using more sophisticated methods to compromise users and networks alike. At the same time, more organizations are enjoying the benefits of cloud computing. But as companies move to the cloud, they're understandably concerned how Microsoft 365 will protect their users and data from being compromised by cybercriminals.

Compared to a few years ago, companies today have many more factors to consider when dealing with different entities such as users, devices, apps, and data. While data is being shared with employees, business partners, and customers, organizations must protect users’ identities and data stored on their devices and apps. Organizations also need to mitigate the risks of providing flexibility and space while maintaining company security policies and detecting threats, all while giving workers a better and more productive experience.

This process can be overwhelming to many organizations that are concerned about losing control of sensitive data. Statistics show that most data breaches that have occurred could have been avoided by implementing the appropriate internal controls. As hackers become more sophisticated in their attacks, data theft continues to rise. Many businesses have declared a list of approved services and applications. However, an alarming number of employees use non-approved third-party<sup></sup> apps and personal storage services to store sensitive company documents.

So how much control do companies have?

In an on-premises environment, you have firewalls, email gateways, and proxies that can conduct content inspection. That protection boundary has now expanded to include mobile devices, tablets, and cloud assets. Often the devices that have access to a company’s data are either lightly managed or not managed at all. Some companies may use Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions to help enforce some level of security. For example, they may encrypt the device or configure it for remote wipe in the event the device gets stolen. However, they still don’t have any control when data on those devices moves outside their controlled environment.

In today’s cloud-centric world, organizations are faced with the unregulated (such as files on cloud storage services) and the unknown (such as advanced threats targeting users’ email). This situation is more difficult to protect because data is now stored everywhere - it’s on-premises, on PCs, on phones, and in the cloud.

The question now becomes - how do companies operate in this world but still adhere to security and business requirements to protect information, particularly when you’re dealing with not only your own intellectual property but also personal identifiable information such as personal identification numbers and credit cards? How does your business protect that information?

Microsoft is invested in addressing these challenges and in helping organizations be more secure by helping them to protect against, detect, and respond to various threat vectors. The remaining units in this module examine the most common threat vectors that organizations must face today.
