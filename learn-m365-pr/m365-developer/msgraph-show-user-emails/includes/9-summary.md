You needed to show a userâ€™s emails in your app to let them quickly see with who they were communicating recently. You built your app so that users can sign in to it using their Microsoft 365 account. After signing in, you retrieved their latest emails using Microsoft Graph. By using the MSAL and Microsoft Graph SDKs, you could quickly connect your app to Microsoft 365 and focus on building your app.
