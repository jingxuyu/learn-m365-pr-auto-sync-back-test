In this module you learned about update management options and how they work across Office 365 ProPlus and Office 2019 editions. You also learned how to add apps, languages, or configurations to existing Office installations using a method called “second install.” Finally, you learned how to troubleshoot and manage common issues with software updates, activation, and potentially corrupted or misconfigured installations.
