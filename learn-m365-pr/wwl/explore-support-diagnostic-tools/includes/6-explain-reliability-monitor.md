The Reliability Monitor reviews a computer’s reliability and problem history. You can use the Reliability Monitor to produce several kinds of reports and charts that can help you identify the source of reliability issues. You can access Reliability Monitor when you select the View reliability history in the Maintenance section of the Action Center.

### System stability chart

In Reliability Monitor, a system stability chart summarizes annual system stability in daily increments. This chart indicates any information, error, or warning messages. In addition, it simplifies the task of identifying issues and the date on which they occurred.

### Installation and failure reports

The System Stability Report provides information about each event in the chart, including:

 -  Software Installs
 -  Software Uninstalls
 -  Application Failures
 -  Hardware Failures
 -  Windows Failures
 -  Miscellaneous Failures

### Records key events in a timeline

Reliability Monitor tracks key events about the system configuration, such as the installation of new apps, operating system patches, and drivers. It also helps you identify the causes of reliability issues by tracking the following events:

 -  Memory problems
 -  Hard-disk problems
 -  Driver problems
 -  Application failures
 -  Operating system failures

Reliability Monitor provides a timeline of system changes, and then reports on a system’s reliability. You can use this timeline to determine whether a particular system change correlates with the start of system instability. Reliability Monitor stores the history of these events for up to one year.

### The Problem Reports and Solutions tool

The Problem Reports and Solutions tool in Reliability Monitor helps you track problem reports and any solution information that other tools have provided. This tool helps store information only. Windows Error Reporting manages all Internet communication–related to problem reports and solutions. Problem Reports and Solutions provides a list of the attempts made to diagnose a computer’s problems.

If an error occurs while an app is running, Windows Error Reporting prompts the user to choose whether they want to send error information to Microsoft over the Internet. If information is available that can help a user resolve a problem, Windows displays a message to the user with a link to information about how to resolve the issue.

You can use Problem Reports and Solutions to track resolution information and to recheck and find new solutions. You start Problem Reports and Solutions from Reliability Monitor. The following options are available in the tool:

 -  Save reliability history
 -  View all problem reports
 -  Check for solutions to all problems
 -  Clear the solution and problem history
