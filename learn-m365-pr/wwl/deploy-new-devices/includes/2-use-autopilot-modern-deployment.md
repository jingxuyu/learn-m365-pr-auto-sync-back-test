Modern deployment methods take a new approach to provisioning devices. One of the key benefits of Windows 10 and later is a feature called Windows Autopilot. Windows Autopilot is a cloud-based deployment method. With Autopilot, you can set up and pre-configure both new and existing Windows 10 or later devices. Users in your organization use a new operating system out-of-the-box experience (OOBE) to configure their devices without needing a Windows image.

Autopilot offers the following advantages over on-premises deployment methods:

 -  You don't need to use images.
 -  You don't need to customize the deployments by injecting drivers.
 -  You don't need to deploy and maintain a deployment infrastructure.
 -  Configuring Autopilot deployments are relatively simple compared to traditional image creation and management.
 -  With no images to deploy, heavy bandwidth consumption is no longer a concern.

Windows Autopilot is cloud-driven and based around Azure AD Premium and Microsoft Intune. Using Windows Autopilot, you can:

 -  Join devices to Azure AD automatically.
 -  Auto-enroll your users' devices into MDM services.
 -  Restrict the creation of the Administrator account.
 -  Customize the OOBE content specifically to your organization.

### New Devices

Most organizations purchase new devices from an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). In this process, the device will typically be purchased with an OEM license of Windows 10 or Windows 11 (usually Pro edition) and this will be pre-installed on the device when it's shipped to the customer. The OEM image is rarely desired, and until Windows 10, re-imaging the device was the most efficient method of configuring the device to organizational requirements.

It is no longer necessary to re-image the device when the device already has Windows 10 or later. Regardless of the configuration of the OEM image or applications that are installed, Autopilot can reconfigure the device to suit the organization's requirements, including installing Line-Of-Business Apps, and even changing the edition (such as switching from Pro to Enterprise).

From the user's perspective, powering on the device provides an OOBE, with the organization deciding which options remain user-configurable, including the ability to deliver a zero-touch installation (ZTI) experience where the device is ready to use after simply plugging it in and turning it on.

### Refresh Existing Devices

Over time, scenarios arise where it may be beneficial to refresh the device. Performance can be affected more apps are installed over time or possibly issues can appear that are intermittent or cannot be easily solved. IT might elect to perform a wipe-and-load, and as with new deployments, Autopilot can be used in place of traditional methods. Similarly, if a device is re-assigned to another user, Autopilot can be used to reset the device, with a new OOBE as if the device was wiped and re-imaged.

Windows 10 and later still supports traditional deployment. Many organizations use image-based deployment to upgrade their computers to Windows 10 or Windows 11, although in-place upgrade is the recommended upgrade path when upgrading from Windows 8.1. Once a device is upgraded to Windows 10 or Windows 11, organizations have the choice as to whether they continue to use image-based deployment or adopt modern deployment methods such as Autopilot or, in the case of upgrading from Windows 10 to Windows 11, using Feature update.

There are certain circumstances where traditional installation methods must be used instead of Autopilot. These scenarios include:

 -  Bare-metal deployments.
 -  When the storage hardware where Windows 10 or Windows 11 is installed must be replaced.
 -  When the Windows 10 or Windows 11 installation has become corrupt.
 -  When an organization requires prompts for custom user information beyond what the OOBE provides (such as customizing the LTI interface with MDT)
