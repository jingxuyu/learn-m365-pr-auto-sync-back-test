Microsoft Viva Goals is a goal-setting and management solution that aligns teams to your organizationâ€™s strategic priorities, driving results and a thriving business.

Viva Goals leverages "Objectives and Key Results" (OKRs), a proven goal-setting framework for creating alignment, focus, and a highly engaged work culture to drive business outcomes.

OKRs connect the mission and values of your business, your business's priorities, and your employee experience - the work that you and your team do every day.
