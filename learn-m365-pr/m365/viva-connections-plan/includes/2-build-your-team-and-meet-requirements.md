### Identify key stakeholders

After deciding to use [Viva
Connections](https://adoption.microsoft.com/viva/), the first step is to
identify the key stakeholders. These are the people who will prioritize
which tasks, tools, and resources should be streamlined and supported by
Viva Connections.

**A typical team of stakeholders includes:**

-   Business partners (from groups like HR, communications specialists,
    and technology advocates) to identify the most valuable workflows
    and tasks that can be supported by Viva Connections.

-   SharePoint and Microsoft Teams admins who can help with tasks in
    admin centers.

-   SharePoint site owners and authors for the home site who will manage
    content, navigation design, and authoring and updating the
    Dashboard.

-   Additional site owners and authors may be involved to update content
    or news post that will be relevant to the Viva Connections
    experience.

-   Organizational leaders (sometimes called executive sponsors) and
    early adopters (sometimes called champions) who can help others at
    the organization announce and scale Viva Connections.

The table below outlines some of the key stakeholders in each phase of
the implementation process, as well as their roles and responsibilities.
These stakeholders will be your go-to experts when it comes to the
planning, building, and launch phases. Stakeholder will be the planning
team that decides what scenarios will be the most beneficial to each
business unit, how to customize the platform accordingly, and how to
help your organization transition to using Viva Connections to help with
their daily tasks.

**Before finalizing your list of key stakeholders, answer these
questions:**

-   Who can represent the most important jobs, roles, and regions that
    should be supported by Viva Connections?

-   How can the team members contribute to identify key scenarios and
    tasks for employees in each unit, or organization-wise?

-   Which roles and regions need the most support?

-   Who in the organization has line of sight to leaders, organizational
    announcements, and the overall culture?

-   Who are the best representatives to help create and manage redundant
    workflows and tasks?

**Best practices for building your team of stakeholders:**

-   Build Viva Connections with the help from several people, including
    owners of various business units who have a comprehensive
    understanding of business processes, workflows domain knowledge, and
    change management knowledge.

-   Involve your stakeholders in the planning process to make sure the
    needs of everyone at your organization are represented so that Viva
    Connections can have the largest impact possible.

-   In most cases, this team will include a few technical professionals
    as well as human resources people, communications specialists, and
    operations employees, to name a few.

-   HR professionals typically have a significant understanding of the
    work the employees do. Start with the suggestions from your HR
    professionals, then utilize input from individual business units in
    the form of a needs assessment to help make final decisions.

### Meet technical requirements

The team of stakeholders can help make decisions and set priorities for
meeting technical requirements. If your organization does not already
have a home site with customized global navigation, you can use this as
your team's first assignment. Both requirements will benefit from the
planning team's diverse perspectives of different roles and regions.

-   If your organization already has a home site and customized global
    navigation, but you are still using classic sites and pages,
    consider strategically modernizing sites and pages that are key to
    the Viva Connections experience.

-   If your organization already has a home site, customized global
    navigation, and modern sites, then you have met the technical
    requirements for Viva Connections.

> **Step 1 -- Create a home site**: Create a SharePoint communication
> site and [set it as a home site in the SharePoint admin
> center](/sharepoint/home-site). Home
> sites activate special features and provide a landing portal for the
> entire organization.
>
:::image type="content" source="../media/image3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an imaginary organization RELECLOUD Sharepoint homesite" :::
> **Step 2 -- Customize global navigation:** [Enable global navigation
> for the SharePoint application
> bar](/viva/connections/sharepoint-app-bar).
> Navigational links in global navigation get inherited by the Viva
> Connections experience. Without enabling and customizing global
> navigation, there will not be any links in the Resources tab in the
> mobile app.

> **Step 3 -- Audit and modernize sites and content**: Sites that have
> not been modernized will open in a separate browser window instead of
> in Microsoft Teams. [Consider modernizing sites and

### Learn how Lamna Healthcare builds their planning team

As the Internal Communications Manager of Lamna Healthcare, when it's
time to start gathering your team of stakeholders to plan the deployment
of Viva Connections at Lamna Healthcare, you consider who can help to
make Viva Connections beneficial for the different roles and regions.
These individuals will serve as your Viva Connections planning committee
and will ensure the platform is as useful to all groups of employees as
possible.

You first contact the HR team, which is in close contact with Lamna's
employees and is also responsible for maintaining their mental health
and wellbeing. You know that collaborating with HR professionals can
help you brainstorm what day-to-day functioning can be streamlined and
automated for employees.

Next, you recruit business owners from each business unit to learn more
about different tasks and regions, for roles like physicians, nurses, IT
professionals, student interns, office administrators, janitorial staff,
and other employees.

Then, you also ask for input from departmental communication specialists
and SharePoint site owners so that you can better understand how news
and resources are communicated to the employees at both the organization
and departmental levels.

Finally, you invite Lamna Healthcare's Microsoft Teams and SharePoint
admins and a team of IT experts to help complete technical requirements
and advise other technical decisions.

By collaborating with a wide range of stakeholders who work directly
with all the different business units at the hospital, you'll get
insights into how to best inform, connect, and engage employees, and
which tasks and scenarios in employees' daily work can be streamlined
with Viva Connections.
