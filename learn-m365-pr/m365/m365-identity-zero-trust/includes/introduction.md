## Zero Trust overview
Cloud applications and the mobile workforce have redefined the security perimeter. Employees are bringing their own devices and working remotely. Data is being accessed outside the corporate network and shared with external collaborators such as partners and vendors. Corporate applications and data are moving from on-premises to hybrid and cloud environments. 

The new perimeter isn’t defined by the physical location(s) of the organization—it now extends to every access point that hosts, stores, or accesses corporate resources and services. Interactions with corporate resources and services now often bypass on-premises perimeter-based security models that rely on network firewalls and VPNs. Organizations which rely solely on on-premises firewalls and VPNs lack the visibility, solution integration, and agility to deliver timely, end-to-end security coverage. 

Today, organizations need a new security model that more effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment, embraces the mobile workforce, and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they are located. This is the core of Zero Trust.

Instead of believing everything behind a corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, Zero Trust teaches us to “never trust, always verify.” 

In a Zero Trust model, every access request is strongly authenticated, authorized within policy constraints, and inspected for anomalies before being granted access. Everything from the user’s identity to the application’s hosting environment is assessed to prevent breach. Micro-segmentation and least privileged access principles are applied to minimize lateral movement. Finally, rich intelligence and analytics help us identify what happened, what was compromised, and how to prevent it from happening again.

**Guiding principles of Zero Trust:**
- **Verify explicitly**. Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.
- **Use least privileged access**. Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive polices and data protection to protect both data and productivity.
- **Assume breach**. Minimize breach blast radius and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and application awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end to end. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.
