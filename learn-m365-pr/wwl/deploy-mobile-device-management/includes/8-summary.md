This module examined how to deploy Mobile Device Management in Microsoft 365. Before organizations can start managing devices in Microsoft 365, they must first activate and configure MDM, and then enroll their devices. Organizations can activate Microsoft Intune by choosing the MDM authority in Microsoft 365 Endpoint Manager. For Basic Mobility and Security, they must run a link to activate it.

This module examined the preparation tasks that organizations must complete before they can deploy MDM. These tasks include:

 -  Integrating MDM with Azure AD.
 -  Adding DNS records for clients to use Autodiscover when enrolling the devices.
 -  Obtaining an Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) certificate, which is required for enrolling and managing iOS devices.

You learned that organizations can enroll all supported device types to MDM, which includes Android, iOS, and Windows devices. Companies can also limit enrollment by configuring enrollment restrictions. They can also set up other enrollment policies, such as requiring employees to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when enrolling devices. MFA requires another form of authentication, such as a phone call, text message, or app notification when a user wants to enroll the device.

After MDM is activated and configured, users can start enrolling their devices. This module examined how Windows 10 devices can be enrolled by using either the Settings app, enrollment package, or Company Portal app that can be installed from the Microsoft store. Android and iOS devices can be enrolled by using the Company Portal app that can be installed from Google Play store or from the Apple app store, respectively.

This module explored how to activate and deploy Mobile Device Management services in Microsoft 365. It did an in-depth analysis on how to configure domains for MDM by adding DNS records for clients to use Autodiscover when enrolling devices.

It's not uncommon for users to use their personal Windows 10, Android, and Apple devices at work. The module examined the unique requirements that Apple devices must satisfy to be enrolled in MDM. Foremost is the need to obtain an Apple Push Notifications Service (APNS) certificate to enroll and manage iOS devices.

The module concluded by examining the various policies that can be integrated with your MDM solution. For example, organizations can manage device security policies that can control password settings, encryption settings, and settings that control the use of device features. They can also define a corporate device enrollment policy that can limit enrollment and enable multi-factor authentication.
