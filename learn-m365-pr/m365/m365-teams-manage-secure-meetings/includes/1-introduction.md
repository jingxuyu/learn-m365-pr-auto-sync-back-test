In Microsoft Teams meetings, users often exchange personal and business-critical information. It's vital to make sure that there are no security weaknesses that can make that information vulnerable. One way to tighten security is to use Teams policies.

Suppose you're a Teams Administrator working for a large multi-national organization.  You've successfully deployed Microsoft Teams meetings across your organization. Now you want to understand how to secure Microsoft Teams meetings so you can meet your organizations compliance and regulatory needs.
