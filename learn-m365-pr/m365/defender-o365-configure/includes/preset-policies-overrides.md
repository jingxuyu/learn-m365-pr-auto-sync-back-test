Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides customizable policies that help you configure protection settings. There are a couple of tools you can use to update your security posture in Microsoft Defender for Office 365.

- Preset security policies
- Message overrides

## Preset security policies

A preset security policies provide the means to apply all the necessary security policies to all your users at the same time, for example phishing, malware and spam policies. These policy settings canâ€™t be changed by you or your security team as they are defined by Microsoft, based on their experience and observations. These policies aim for balance by keeping harmful content away from your users without disrupting their work. Preset security policies consist of the following:

- Profiles
- Policies
- Policy settings

> [!NOTE]
> The order of precedence for these policies is important if multiple preset security policies and other policies apply to the same user.

## Profiles

A profile determines the level of protection. There are two settings:

- **Standard protection**: A baseline protection profile that's suitable for most users.
- **Strict protection**: A more aggressive protection profile for selected users and groups, for example a team working on a confidential project.

You can apply these preset security policies by recipient, group membership, or domain. When multiple policies are applied to the same user, the order of precedence for the profile application is:

1. Strict preset policies
1. Standard preset policies
1. Custom policies
1. Default settings

### Conditions and exceptions

By using rules with conditions and exceptions, you can determine whether the profiles will or won't be applied. Each policy only allows you to use a condition or exception once. However, you can specify multiple values for the condition or exception.  When using multiple values in the same condition or exception, you must use OR logic, and for different conditions or exceptions use AND logic.

To access the preset policies, launch the Microsoft 365 security center.

1. Select **Policies & rules**
1. Then select **Threat policies**
   1. Enter the type of policies you want to view.

## Message overrides

A message override is a tenant-level or user-level configuration that instructs Office 365 to deliver mail even when the system has determined that the message is suspicious or contains malicious content. It's estimated that 20% of all phishing messages delivered to inboxes are delivered because of an override. You can review overrides so that you can be made aware of the policies or settings that may be causing the delivery of unwanted mail.

To view overrides:

1. Select **Reports**
1. Then select **Email & collaboration reports**
1. Finally, select **Email & collaboration reports**

1. Scroll down to view the report.

Here you see a graph showing the number of overrides by day and color coded by type of override. Some of the overrides are the result of an Exchange transport rule and User Safe Sender category.  
You should make a habit of viewing these tables frequently to investigate the causes of overrides, which will help you and your security team determine what policy changes might need to be changed over time.
