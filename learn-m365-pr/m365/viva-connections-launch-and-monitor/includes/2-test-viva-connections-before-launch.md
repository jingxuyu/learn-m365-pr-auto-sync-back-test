Before sharing Viva Connections with the rest of your organization,
recruit a small group of users to test and refine popular workflows to
ensure end-users have a great experience using Viva Connections for the
first time. Consider recruiting specific people from different audiences
to complete popular tasks. Make improvements until the experience is
ideal for the rest of the organization.

**Best practices for testing:**

-   Test with early adopters and champions and capture their feedback

-   Use the approved web browser for your organization

-   Test Viva Connections on a desktop device and mobile device

-   Make sure all the links are active and there aren’t any dead ends

-   Pay attention to labels on Dashboard cards and buttons – will they
    make sense to the rest of the organization?

-   Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of icons and images

-   Check for performance issues like slow loading times or missing
    images

-   Ask testers about the navigation experience with user experience
    surveys. For example, “How easy is it to navigate Viva Connections?”
    “Did you run into any broken links? If so, please indicate here.”
    You can find many other examples online by searching on the Internet
    for “UX survey templates” or “app user experience survey questions”
    to guide you.

feedback based on their roles. For example, clocking in, clocking out,
viewing the café menu, and checking the holiday schedule. Ask testers to
