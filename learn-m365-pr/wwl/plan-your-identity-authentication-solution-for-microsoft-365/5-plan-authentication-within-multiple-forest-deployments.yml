quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Fabrikam has multiple on-premises Active Directory forests and a single Microsoft 365 tenant. To complete its hybrid deployment prerequisites, what must Fabrikam do so that its secure mail transport functions correctly in its hybrid deployment?"
    choices:
    - content: "Simplify its on-premises environment by combining its Active Directory forests"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This consideration is recommended to reduce overhead for authentication purposes."
    - content: "Each forest must use a globally trusted, dedicated CA-issued certificate"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. All hybrid deployments require a digital certificate issued by trusted third-party certificate authority (CA). For a multi-forest hybrid deployment, a single digital certificate can't be used for multiple Active Directory forests. Each forest must use a globally trusted, dedicated CA-issued certificate for secure mail transport to function correctly in a hybrid deployment."
    - content: "Consider deploying Microsoft 365 only in your primary sign-in forest for your initial rollout of Microsoft 365"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This consideration is recommended for authentication purposes."
