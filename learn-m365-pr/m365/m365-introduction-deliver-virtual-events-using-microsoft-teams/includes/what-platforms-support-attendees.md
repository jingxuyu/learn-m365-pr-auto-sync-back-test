When you move from in person to virtual events, you need to ensure everyone involved in the event can participate.

You need to understand the software and hardware requirements for your event attendees and presenters. You know that there are both web and mobile versions of Teams, but you're not as familiar with the desktop app hardware requirements are. You also need to make sure that your organization has the right licenses to support the kind of event you're creating.

## Devices and clients

The members of your event team and the attendees can choose from a range of clients. For presenters, producers, and moderators, a desktop client is recommended. While you can present from the web or mobile versions, the Teams experience is more limited in those versions.

Your attendees can attend using desktop, web, or mobile apps, or they might use a Teams Room device.

The easiest way to make sure your attendees and event team members have the right devices and clients is to include a link to the product documentation in the event invite. Ask them to go to [Get clients for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/get-clients) to make sure they meet the hardware and software requirements.

## Licensing

Teams is available with several different licenses, from the free version to the Teams Exploratory license. However, specific Microsoft 365 or Office 365 licenses are required to get the full features and support for live events. Check which license you need at [Admin quick start - Meetings and live events in Microsoft Teams](microsoftteams/quick-start-meetings-live-events)
