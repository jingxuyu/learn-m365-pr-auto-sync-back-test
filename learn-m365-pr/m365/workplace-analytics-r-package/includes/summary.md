In the introductory scenario, as a data analyst for HR business intelligence, you want to use advanced analysis techniques and learn new ways to visualize Viva Insights data through the Workplace Analytics app. You now know about the `wpa` R package for creating more flexible analysis and incorporating new techniques into your current process.

This analysis would otherwise be time-consuming and cumbersome to create from scratch. To build a tool to validate and explore the data on your own, you could create custom Power BI reports by using advanced DAX code, or write your own code to create the analysis in R, but this work would require a lot of time and advanced programming expertise.

The `wpa` R package is an easy way to incorporate more advanced collaboration analysis into a data science workflow. You now understand how including the `wpa` R package in your data analysis workflow enables greater flexibility for advanced analysis. This package empowers you to create and share deeper insights about employee work patterns with your organization's leaders.

Now that you have finished this module, you should be able to:

* Explain what the `wpa` R package is, and how to use it to analyze Workplace Analytics data.
* Install R and set up the `wpa` R package.
* Use the `wpa` R package to validate and explore Workplace Analytics data.
* Run quick-start reports and use the functions in the `wpa` R package to create your own analysis.

The `wpa` R package is continuously evolving and integrating more new features and functions. Check the package website often to ensure you have the latest features. As an open-source project, `wpa` also welcomes and relies on contributions from you, such as:
