This Module covered the Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune, two primary tools used within the Microsoft Endpoint Manager. The Configuration Manager client gives administrators the ability to track software on a device, provide inventory information in relation to hardware, and manage and deploy the OS and LoB applications. For users, the Configuration Manager client enables a feature rich self-service catalogue of software that empowers the user to choose what software to install. Popular client deployment methods such as client push, manual deployment, OS deployment, and Microsoft Intune allow admins flexibility in their deployment approach. Built in features within Configuration Manager such as client status, client activity, primary user, OS build, and Client check can alert you to issues requiring further attention. Collections are a way for Configuration Manager to represent devices or users that have same degree of commonality allowing for easier targeted deployments and reporting.
