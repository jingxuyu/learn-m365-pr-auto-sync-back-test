## Is Windows Virtual Desktop the right choice?

Let's reconsider our accounting firm scenario from the first unit. The key points from that scenario were:

- Users need to be able to work from any device from anywhere.
- During tax season, short-term employees are hired to be able to meet customer needs and tax deadlines.
- Tax software changes from year to year and the organization has some legacy applications that are a challenge to support.
- You need to provide a secure, consistent, and performant experience to the apps employees need to do their work.

Windows Virtual Desktop can support all these scenarios and would be a good choice for this organization.
