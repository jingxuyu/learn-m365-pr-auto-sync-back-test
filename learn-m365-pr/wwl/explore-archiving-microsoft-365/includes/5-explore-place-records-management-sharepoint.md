A record is a document or other electronic or physical entity in an organization that serves as evidence of an activity or a transaction that was completed by the organization. A record must be retained for a selected period of time. Archiving such records is known as Records management. It's the process by which an organization:<br>

 -  Determines what kinds of information should be considered records.
 -  Determines how active documents that will become records should be handled while they're being used.
 -  Determines how active documents should be collected after they're declared to be records.
 -  Determines in what manner and for how long each record type should be retained to meet legal, business, or regulatory requirements.
 -  Researches and implements technological solutions and business processes to help ensure the organization follows its records management obligations in a cost-effective and non-intrusive way.
 -  Completes records-related tasks such as disposing of expired records or locating and protecting records that are related to external events such as lawsuits.

Determining which documents and other physical or electronic items in your organization are records is the responsibility of corporate compliance officers, records managers, and lawyers. By carefully categorizing all enterprise content in your organization, these people can help ensure that documents are kept for the appropriate period of time. A well-designed records management system helps protect an organization legally, helps the organization demonstrate compliance with regulatory obligations, and increases organizational efficiency by promoting the disposition of out-of-date items that aren't records.

In SharePoint, archiving is referred to as In-Place Records Management. You can either manage records in place, which means that you can leave a document in its current location on a site, or you can classify documents as records and store them in a specific archive, such as a Records Center site.

Before you implement records management, it's recommended that you choose one of the following records management plans for your organization:

### A Records Center Site

A Records Center site in SharePoint serves as an archive. Documents are copied to the archive when they become records. Whether a document is a record or not is determined by whether it lives in the records archive or elsewhere.

### Managing Records in Place

Also known as In Place Records Management, it's an alternative to the traditional process of copying or moving records to another location. You can manage records in place, declare it as a record, and apply the appropriate security, retention, and disposition properties to the record.

You can also take a hybrid approach to record management. For example, you could keep records in place with active documents for two years, and then move records to a records archive when a project is complete.

When weighing the pros and cons of these two methods of records management, ask yourself the following questions:

 -  **Is your industry subject to regulatory requirements that mandate records be separated from active documents?** Consider items such as signed contracts and employee information records with unique requirements. You can have workflows pass information to the Records Center and then use workflows to declare items as records and start dispositions on the files. As a result, after either seven years, or whatever your timeline is, the document will be removed from the environment.
 -  **Should the administrator of a collaboration site be trusted to manage a site that contains records?** You might want to store records in a site that uses more restricted access than a site used for collaboration by multiple users.
 -  **How long will the collaboration site be in use?** If records must be kept for longer than the project is ongoing, selecting an in-place records management strategy means that you must maintain the collaboration site even after it's no longer used.
 -  **Will the project members need frequent access to the documents after the documents have become records?** If you use an in-place approach, project members can access documents in the same manner. In this case, it won't matter whether they're active documents or records.
 -  **Are records managers in your organization responsible for only records, or are they responsible for all information, including active documents and records?** If records managers are responsible only for official records, having a separate Records Center site might be easier for them.
