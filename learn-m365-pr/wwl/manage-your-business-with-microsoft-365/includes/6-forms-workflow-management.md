Microsoft 365 helps make capturing, tracking, and acting on data and requests easier with built-in apps and tools designed to simplify and manage processes.

## Microsoft Forms

Microsoft Forms allows you to quickly gather data with easy-to-create surveys, polls, and questionnaires that can be distributed online and accessed from any web browser. Track responses in real-time or export results into several Microsoft and third-party tools to share and act on findings. 

## Microsoft Forms Pro

Microsoft Forms Pro is an enterprise survey capability that helps businesses obtain the feedback they need to make smarter decisions. Powered by both Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365, Forms Pro supports businesses seeking to transform customer, product, and employee experiences.
Forms Pro is built on Microsoft Forms, and it offers new capabilities that make capturing and analyzing customer and employee feedback simpler than ever. Your customers can respond to the surveys by using any web browser or mobile device. As the responses are submitted, analyze them with Power BI reports and make effective decisions accordingly.

Forms Pro has robust tooling to support deeper analytics and insights with integration across your tools, such as Common Data Service, Microsoft Power Platform, and the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. With Forms Pro, you can send your customers branded surveys that have your company's look and feel. Survey distribution is simpler with the built-in email composer. You can also automate sending surveys by using Microsoft Power Automate and leverage pre-configured flow templates to integrate with the model-driven apps in Dynamics 365.

Use Forms Pro to work with classic forms and quizzes and create new ones. The classic forms and quizzes open in their respective interfaces within the Forms Pro environment. This gives you the ability to work with surveys and classic forms together.

## Microsoft Bookings

Microsoft Bookings is a web-based appointment scheduling system that integrates with Outlook to provide your customers with the means to book an appointment with members of your staff.  Automated notification emails reduce no-shows and enhance customer satisfaction. Bookings can be designed to fit the situation and needs of many different parts of an organization.

Bookings can be scheduled and staffed in two different ways. The first way is by the customer using a standalone booking page or an embedded booking page that you integrate into your web site. The other way is for you or one of your employees to enter the bookings manually, such as when a customer calls for an appointment.

Bookings has three primary components:

- A booking page where your customers and clients can schedule appointments with a  staff member. This web-based scheduling page can be shared via a direct link, your Facebook page, and even through link embedding within your website.
- A web-based, business-facing page where Bookings calendar owners and administrators within an organization can define appointment types and details, manage staff schedules and availability, set business hours, and customize how appointments are scheduled. 
- A business-facing mobile app where Bookings calendar owners and administrators can see all of their appointments, access customer lists and contact information, and make manual bookings on the go.

Microsoft Bookings can provide you with:

- Improved convenience for customers – Online appointment scheduling gives customers the freedom to find a timeslot that suits them, and to reschedule if needed.
- Improved buffer time between appointments – When scheduling back-to-back appointments for your staff, you can now build in any required pre or post activities.
- Improved cost and team management – managers can modify staff-lists, define services and pricing and set work hours.
