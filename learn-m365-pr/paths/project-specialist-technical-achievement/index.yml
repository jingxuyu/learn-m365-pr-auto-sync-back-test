title: Project Specialist Technical Achievement(temp name)
prerequisites: |
  A general understanding of Microsoft 365.
summary: |
  This learning path brings together introductory level information on Teams, Power Platforms, and Security &amp; Compliance.  A basic understanding of these three solution areas provide  leaners with building blocks for providing secure, integrated work management solutions.
  A new learning path will be created, from existing MS Learn content.  This learning path will be part of TSI for Project Specialist and represents the technical content within their overall TSI requirements, hence the proposed trophy name of Project Specialist Technical Achievement.  We don't yet have the proposed name of the actual LP as it will appear on Learn (will be forthcoming).
