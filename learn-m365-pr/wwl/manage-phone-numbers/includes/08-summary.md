This module examined the Microsoft Teams cloud voice capabilities that are delivered in Microsoft 365. These capabilities provide Private Branch Exchange (PBX) functionality and options for connecting to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Microsoftâ€™s technology that enables call control and PBX capabilities is titled Phone System. 

This module also examined Microsoft Teams Calling Plans, which offer cloud-based telephony services from Microsoft. There are no on-premises infrastructure requirements. With Calling Plans, PTSN connectivity is provided by Microsoft. Calling Plans are available in specific countries.

In this module, you explored how Direct Routing enables organizations to use their existing PTSN infrastructure and their existing PBX. Direct Routing is used in situations where no calling plans are available. You also learned how to determine Call Plan availability and how to set up phone numbers with Call Plans.
