    choices:

    - content: "It works across on-premises and cloud apps and devices."
      isCorrect: true

    - content: "It reduces the need for data protection."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Single sign-on is more convenient for users, but does not remove the need for data protection policies and safeguards."
  - content: "What does Microsoft’s Discover & Respond solution do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Protects against malware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft’s Discover & Respond solution is not designed to protect an organization against malware."
    - content: "Helps you find, refine, and prepare relevant content."

      explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft's Discover & Respond is designed to help you find relevant content, refine content, and prepare content to be handed off to the requesting body in an efficient way."
    - content: "Encrypts cloud data."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Microsoft’s Discover & Respond solution is not designed to encrypt cloud data."
  - content: "What is identity management?"
    choices:
    - content: "The process of identifying a user."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Identifying users, and protecting users' identities is important because it determines who can access data."
    - content: "A type of user account."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Users are identified through their user accounts, but there is more to identity management than creating a user account, including validating that the user account has not been compromised."
    - content: "Azure's security solution."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Identity management is part of many different security solutions; it is not specific to Azure."
