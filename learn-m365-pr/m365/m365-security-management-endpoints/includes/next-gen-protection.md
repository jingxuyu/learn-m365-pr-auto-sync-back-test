Microsoft next-gen technologies in Windows Defender Antivirus provide near-instant, automated protection against new and emerging threats. To dynamically identify new threats, these technologies work with large sets of interconnected data in the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph and powerful artificial intelligence (AI) systems driven by advanced machine learning models.

Windows Defender Antivirus includes:
- Cloud-delivered protection for near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats. Along with machine learning and the Intelligent Security Graph, cloud-delivered protection is part of the next-gen technologies that power Windows Defender Antivirus.
- Always-on scanning, using advanced file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as "real-time protection")
- Dedicated protection updates based on machine-learning, human and automated big-data analysis, and in-depth threat resistance research

Always-on protection consists of real-time protection, behavior monitoring, and methods to identify malware based on known suspicious and malicious activities. These activities include events such as processes making unusual changes to existing files, modifying or creating automatic startup registry keys and startup locations (also known as auto-start extensibility points, or ASEPs), and other changes to the file system or file structure.

With cloud-delivered protection, next-gen technologies provide rapid identification of new threats, sometimes even before a single machine is infected.
