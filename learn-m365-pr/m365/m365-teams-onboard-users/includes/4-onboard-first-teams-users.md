The best way to drive adoption of Teams is to use the product. We recommend that as the admin, you manage your Microsoft 365 deployment with Teams. You should also create a community of employees who are focused on teamwork and productivity. (These initial teams may change over time.)

Here, you will learn how to get started with your early adopters.

## Prepare your Teams environment

With your project team defined, and a list of possible champions identified, you should create a number of teams and channels in Teams to support your roll out.

### Understand teams and channels in Microsoft Teams

The concepts of teams and channels are fundamental to the implementation of Teams:

- A team is a collection of people, content, and tools that work together to produce a business outcome for your company. Teams are built on Microsoft 365 Groups, and changes to Microsoft 365 group membership sync to the team.
- Channels are the collaboration spaces within a team in which the actual work is done.

Team access types determine who can join a team:

- *Private* teams are restricted to team members approved by the team owner(s). This is a typical setting for project teams and virtual teams in a large organization.
- *Public* teams are open to anyone in the organization, and users can join them directly. Public teams are useful for collaboration on topics of general interest to people in different departments or to people who are working on different projects. This is a good default setting for smaller organizations.

You should also consider who can create, edit, and manage a Team. This is essential to avoid numerous unnecessary and duplicated Teams throughout the organization.

If you would like more details, view the short video **Guidance for Setting up Teams, Channels, and Tab**, the link to which is in the **Learn more** section below.

### Setup Teams to support your roll out

To support your roll out of Teams, these are the suggested teams and channels you could create.

| Team name                      | Proposed channel names                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Get to know Teams              | General, Say hi, How do I?, Feedback, Ideas for future teams, Support                                                                                                                                    |
| Microsoft Teams Implementation | General, Awareness and Adoption, Business Engagement, Early Adopter Program, Feedback and Insights, Security and Compliance, Strategy and Planning, Service Health and Incidents, Training, Water cooler Chat |
| Teamwork Champions             | General, Best Practices, Training, Champions Corner, Feedback and Support, Program Leads, Social Hub                                                                                          |

Within Microsoft Teams, the tab gallery gives you access to all Microsoft 365 or Office 365 and third-party apps that have been turned on by the administrator. For more information about the tab gallery, see **What are Microsoft Teams custom tabs?**, a link to which is in the **Learn more** section below. To get the most value from your product, we suggest pinning key resources as tabs in each of the appropriate channels.

In your initial Teams, we suggest pinning the following items for easy reference in your Team channels. These assets are in addition to your OneNote notebook sections. You should consider working with our FastTrack team who will assist you in configuring these first teams.

Using the above as an example, in the Teamwork Champions team's Champions Corner channel, you'll have tabs that link to your internal **Champion Program Guide**, and the external **Microsoft Champion Program**.

## Build your adoption plan

If your organization is small, project planning might all fit in Teams and a simple Planner plan. If you are rolling out Teams to thousands of people, you'll need a more detailed and robust project plan. To help you, Microsoft has an enterprise adoption template that your project managers could use to jumpstart the project, see the **Learn more** section below. At a minimum you should consider a:

- Campaign or marketing launch to raise awareness of Teams.
- Champion led pilot phase.
- Training plan that will help educate users.
- Ways to collect feedback and measure success.

### Design and launch your adoption campaign for Microsoft Teams

:::image type="content" source="../media/4-adoption-campaign.jpg" alt-text="Example poster counting down to a Teams launch":::

For both your initial pilots and your eventual company-wide roll out, your internal communications should be a priority. They include:

- Internal awareness materials such as posters, digital signage, and events.
- Incorporate self-help and training information in a single location.

For your pilot phases these are the minimum steps for success:

- Have a regular scheduled meeting with your project stakeholders for updates.
- Pick a feedback method to gather information from people participating in the pilot. Consider using a public channel within Teams to allow users to join and provide feedback.
- Make self-help documentation available, including product videos.
- Hold a kick-off meeting with the pilot users to get them excited about their participation.  Creating a sense of community with enthusiasm can't be underrated.

Once you have worked through the initial pilot phases, the steps above can be expanded to reach your entire organization. We recommend these individuals be involved early and often as you utilize the available adoption materials or design your own.

For more information, see *FastTrack Center Benefit for Microsoft 365* and *Envision, Onboard and Drive Value with Microsoft 365 Adoption Tools* in the *Learn more* section, below.

### Develop a training plan for Microsoft Teams users

Providing widely available self-help information, training and written guidance will enable users to quickly onboard to the product. Many users will simply jump in once it becomes available. However, everyone learns in different ways - so having a central information portal will support all styles of learning within your organization.

Use Microsoft resources to build a custom end-user training program focused on your organization's needs. You should design your program to allow people to learn as they use Teams. Use the training section below in the **Learn more** section to reduce the time to build the program.
Use your champions as an initial cohort to test and then refine the program. People are busy, so streamlining the training program will help users to complete it.

## Launch to early adopters

Return to the list of employees who expressed interest in being a champion and taking part in an early adopter program. Decide which of these individuals should participate in your initial experiments with Teams. They will be a part of the onboarding process for the projects you selected based on your discussions with business stakeholders, your technical team, and your prioritization you completed above.
Complete the following steps with these early adopters:

1. Send an invitation email to them to invite them into the community.
1. Host a kick-off call to share with them the goals and outcomes of the early adopter program.
1. Ensure access to the feedback channel of your teamwork champions team and any other internal social networking tools you may use.
1. Consider creating periodic surveys for them to complete that will gather targeted information.

### Onboard support for Microsoft Teams

To ensure that the early adopter and champions teams will have the appropriate support as they start using Teams, meet with your support staff and review the capabilities of Teams. Key members of the support organization may want to join your early adopter program. Encourage their use of Teams in their own scenarios. Take them through the basic onboarding of the product by using our online training resources.

### Measure the success

As with any communications and adoption campaign you will want to identify your success measures up front. Consider measures like:

- Active users in the product.
- Views of your information webpages.
- Questions in your user community.
- Views of your training videos.
- Attendance at learning events.
