Power BI Premium provides capabilities that are unmatched in the industry – everything from building automated machine learning models, to cognitive services, pixel perfect paginated reporting, and data preparation at scale on Azure Data Lake Gen2.

With this new generation of Power BI Premium, we have made improvements to the underlying architecture, which will help customers increase their ROI, scale rapidly and get up to 16X faster performance. Customers will also get visibility into utilization at the Workspace level, enabling consistent utilization analysis and cost-management.  In addition, customers will have the ability to opt in to scale capacity as and when needed with a new feature called Autoscale.

We are also excited to announce Premium Per User – which provides capabilities of Power BI Premium, now on a per-user license model as a new option for customers. This offering addresses a key customer and community ask – to provide a lower-cost entry price point to get access to Premium capabilities. Premium Per User will be available at no cost during public preview. Premium per user will be uniquely affordable and highly competitive among individual user offerings in the industry. With per user and per capacity licensing options, customers can choose the best and most cost-efficient package for their needs and enjoy the benefits that Premium provides.
