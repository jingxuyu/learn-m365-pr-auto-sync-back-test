Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of components and authentication providers that helps you connect with Microsoft Graph. The components are reusable HTML tags that are fully functional prebuilt experiences to get data from Microsoft 365.

The components provide access to popular Microsoft 365 datasets with the power of Microsoft Graph. They help you demonstrate data with a prebuilt UI, which looks and feels like Microsoft 365 experiences. The components can also be customized if you want to match your branding.

## Scenario

Suppose you're building a web app that shows a user's upcoming meetings stored in Microsoft 365. Your app is styled to match your organization's brand identity. The data you retrieve from Microsoft 365 should be seamlessly integrated in your app. You want to use Microsoft Graph Toolkit to easily retrieve data from Microsoft 365, but you need to style how the data is presented. You also need to ensure that all data required by the stakeholders appears on the page.
