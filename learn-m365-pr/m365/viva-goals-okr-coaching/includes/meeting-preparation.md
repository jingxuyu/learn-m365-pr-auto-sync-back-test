Part of being an effective facilitator is being prepared for the meeting or conversation you're facilitating.  This means covering logistical details, familiarizing yourself with the team and their work, and ensuring the attendees themselves are prepared.   

## What you should do to prepare as an OKR coach 

- Book time for discussion (2-3 hours).  We recommend going for three hours wherever possible, especially if this is the first time a team has gone through an OKR creation exercise with a coach.   

- Get to know the Team.  What are the existing team dynamics?  How will you ensure everyone contributes? 

- Define who the right attendees are for the discussion and limit attendance to them.   

- Provide resources for attendees to refresh themselves on OKRs or review the OKRs from previous cycles.

- Set expectations for what will occur during the session.  It’s just as important to clearly state what isn't intended to occur during the time as what is. 

## What your attendees should do to prepare 

- Refresh themselves on OKRs (what they’re for, how to write them, etc.). 

- Revisit their organizations strategy and long-term plan. 

- Review their historical OKRs and the OKRs for groups above them (if applicable).

- Start thinking about the first objective question:  ”What is the most important area of our business we need to focus on?” 

Great preparation is the first step for achieving a great outcome.  Don’t skip the steps above, both for you as a coach and for your attendees.
