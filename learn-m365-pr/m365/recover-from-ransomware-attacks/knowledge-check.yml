quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "What should you do to quarantine a compromised device?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete system files on the device to mitigate the damage."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This could make things worse because you could be deleting files that are critical for the device to function properly."
    - content: "Disconnect the device from the network."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This ensures the attack doesn't propagate further."
    - content: "Run the latest update on a device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Running the latest updates on a device is generally good practice, but this doesn't actually quarantine it. Remember, quarantining the device isolates it from other devices, but doesn't necessarily update it while an attack is ongoing."
  - content: "You find a file that you don't recognize in one of your folders. What should you do?"
    choices:
    - content: "Open it to see if you can recognize it."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Don't open the file, because it could be malicious."
    - content: "Remove the file to ensure that you don't accidentally run ransomware."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The file might not necessarily be malicious. For example, it could have been automatically generated by an application that relies on it."
    - content: "Scan the file with an antimalware program."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Scan the file to make sure that it isn't malicious. This lets you know if the file is safe or not."
  - content: "What should you do before you retrieve backups to use for recovery?"
    choices:
    - content: "Delete local backups to prevent the attack from spreading."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Don't delete local backups because they could be useful. Deleting a local backup could prevent you from restoring your data."
    - content: "Create a new backup when the attack happens."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Don't create a new backup when an attack happens, because you might also be backing up malicious code."
    - content: "Verify the backup files don't contain malicious code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Always make sure that the backup you're using hasn't been compromised."
  - content: "Which of the following best describes an attack trajectory?"
    choices:
    - content: "The path a cybercriminal could take to carry out an attack on administrator accounts."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The attack trajectory isn't limited to administrator accounts."
    - content: "The steps a cybercriminal could take to carry out an attack inside a particular server."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The attack trajectory can include more than just a single server."
    - content: "The path a cybercriminal could take to carry out an attack across different entities."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The trajectory covers all types of entities that could be targeted by an attacker."
  - content: "What should an organization use to effectively monitor for suspicious file activity across all its devices in the network?"
    choices:
    - content: "A user monitoring and alerting tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. User monitoring won't be enough to monitor file activity."
    - content: "A file integrity monitoring tool."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This kind of tool is particularly helpful for an organization, because of the scale and complexity of their systems and devices."
    - content: "A network monitoring tool."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Network monitoring won't be enough to monitor file activity."
  - content: "What are factory default settings?"
    choices:
    - content: "The state your device was in when it was first bought."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Factory default settings can be used to easily set the device back to its original state of manufacture."
    - content: "The latest restore point to use for any device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This restore point is the latest state to which the device can be returned. This process is calculated periodically through the use of backups, which means it could be radically different from factory default settings if the device has been used for some time."
    - content: "The last known good backup available for the device."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The last known good backup is the latest available safe backup. If a device has been used already, this could be completely different from factory default settings. The usage of a backup also requires a restore process. Factory default settings don't rely on a restore process."
