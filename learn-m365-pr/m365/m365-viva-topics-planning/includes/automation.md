How you want to use Viva Topics will impact roles in your organization. Viva Topics can help with automating various scenarios, such as onboarding, training, and knowledge sharing, especially with people working remotely. Viva Topics can help employees connect with experts through people cards.

Different roles in your organization will experience different views, access, interaction, and scenarios with topics.

- **Scenario 1: Role onboarding & training**  
   Understanding a new organization's terminology, key projects, and culture are important steps in onboarding. Easy discovery of topics can help new employees ramp up on new job, roles, or projects quickly.
- **Scenario 2: Expertise finding & information sharing**  
   When topics are managed and shared, people in your organizations can more easily find information and experts to help them in their work.
- **Scenario 3: Expanded decision making & improved time to market**
   When information and experts are easy to reach, you can make decisions more easily and shave time off projects.

Viva Topics can automate various scenarios to improve productivity and reduce costs.

## Scenario 1: Role onboarding & training

An HR manager needs to provide information to new employees to help them quickly onboard to the company and their teams. They want to point them to the correct resources, documents, and team members they'll need to onboard quickly and efficiently. This allows the new employee to quickly find the information they need without having to search across multiple repositories or leave the applications they're already using.

For example, Jordan is taking on a new role or has been newly hired and is just starting. Jordan wants to get involved and productive as quickly as possible, but needs help finding a starting place. Before Jordan, Kim was in the role who created topic pages to help new employees and anyone else looking for that information.

## Scenario 2: Expertise finding & information sharing

Viva Topics empowers your people to find experts and share information in the flow of their work to increase productivity and improve job satisfaction.

For example, Kim was an SME and had permissions to look at unconfirmed topic pages. Unconfirmed topic pages are great starting points for what the AI has discovered and created, and Kim was able to edit them to add expert resources, definitions, and pin other resources.

As Jordan reads through a new post on SharePoint, she sees a topic highlight and hovers over it to quickly define the term and can find the contact to ask questions. Before, Jordan might have had to hunt around for this information and contact colleagues to see who to ask about something. This helps Jordan feel more empowered when dealing with the new role.

Exposing this information through topics can be powerful, because although this information may have been available before, it might have been siloed and hard to find. Bringing it into the applications Jordan is using and finding these experts can also drive a sense of engagement and community. It can also help them feel more empowered when dealing with the new role.

Automate this scenario in Viva Topics to ensure:

- New employees can quickly connect with the right people on the right projects.
- New employees have instant access to the latest project information within the flow of their work.
- Search times are greatly reduced.
- Onboarding times are greatly reduced.

## Scenario 3: Expanded decision making & improved time to market

Microsoft's 2020 report, "Knowledge Sharing in a Changing World" includes surveys on information access, resilience, and cost savings in hybrid work environments. This survey targeted IT, business, C-level decision-makers and knowledge-sharing tool users across various industries. Highlights of this survey include:  

- On average, employees could potentially save between 4 to 6 hours each week if they didn't have to search for information—or spend time recreating it, gaining back 11 to 14% in daily productivity.  
- 52% of information workers say the most appealing benefit of knowledge sharing tools is the ability to find information faster—so they can spend more time doing more meaningful work.
- The other top benefits for knowledge workers are limiting the need to recreate information and having a single source of truth.
- 49% of decision-makers welcome the ability to increase employee productivity to save time and money.  
- 45% of decision-makers prioritize preserving knowledge gained from work experience when team members leave the organization or move to a new role.

You can enable customer service to quickly find files and experts to help with unusual questions and quickly document the answer for others to access Viva Topics easily.

For example, a support representative needs to find knowledge base articles quickly, documents and policies to support customers. They want to find the right information at the right time, without having to manually sift through several databases, repositories, applications, or dispatch a call. This allows them to remain within their main call prompt and access policies, regulations, and guidelines to quickly respond to questions and update the case.

Automate this scenario in Viva Topics to ensure:

- Support call times are reduced.
- Escalations to 2nd and 3rd tier support are reduced.
- Number of call-backs on a given case are reduced.
- Customer satisfaction is increased.
