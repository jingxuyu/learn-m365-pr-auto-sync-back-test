In this module, you learned how Microsoft Graph maintains resource health through throttling requests. You saw how to identify when Microsoft Graph is throttling requests by inspecting the received responses.

With the understanding of why and when Microsoft Graph throttles requests, you can decide on  appropriate patterns to implement to address those instances when your applications are throttled. One pattern you learned was how to avoid scenarios when your requests are throttled by using certain features such as delta query and change notifications.
