This module focuses on how organizations use Microsoft Intune to implement endpoint security. It begins by examining how organizations keep their managed devices secure and up to date while helping them protect their data from compromised devices. You'll learn how organizations protect their devices through policies - specifically, Intuneâ€™s device configuration and device compliance policies.

The module then explores how Microsoft Endpoint security policies help organizations focus on the security of their devices and mitigate risk. You'll learn how the tools that are available through Intune help an organization keep its devices secure by enabling it to:

 -  Review the status of all its managed devices.
 -  Deploy security baselines that establish best practice security configurations for devices.
 -  Manage security configurations on devices through tightly focused policies.
 -  Establish device and user requirements through compliance policies.
 -  Integrate Intune with its Microsoft Defender for Endpoint team.

The module then delves into the world of security baselines. Intune makes it easy to deploy Windows security baselines to help organizations secure and protect their users and devices. A security baseline is a group of Microsoft-recommended configuration settings that explains their effect on security. These settings are based on feedback from Microsoft security engineering teams, product groups, partners, and customers.

You'll learn how security baselines help organizations apply and enforce granular security settings that are recommended by the relevant security teams. The module also examines how to manage security baseline profiles in Microsoft Intune. An organization can deploy a default (unmodified) baseline or create a customized profile to enforce the settings it requires for its environment. When an organization creates a security baseline profile in Intune, it's creating a template that consists of multiple device configuration settings.

The module concludes by exploring how to implement attack surface reduction rules. You'll learn how configuring attack surface reduction rules can help reduce an organization's attack surface. Attack surfaces include all the places where an attacker could compromise an organization's devices or networks. Reducing an organization's attack surface means protecting its devices and network. By doing so, attackers have fewer ways to attack.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Microsoft Intune enables organizations to protect their data and devices.
 -  Understand how endpoint security in Microsoft Intune focuses on device security and risk mitigation.
 -  Manage devices with endpoint security in Intune.
 -  Use security baselines to configure Windows devices in Intune.
 -  Implement attack surface reduction rules to reduce an organization's attack surface.
