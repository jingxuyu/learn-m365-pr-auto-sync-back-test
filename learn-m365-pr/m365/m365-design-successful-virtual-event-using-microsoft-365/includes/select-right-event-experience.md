Part of planning and designing your virtual summit is choosing the right type of virtual event. Microsoft 365 supports three distinct options: Teams meetings, webinars, and Teams Live Events. 

In this unit, you'll learn when to use each option, based on your audience and the kind of content you’re presenting.  If you completed the Introduction to virtual events in Microsoft 365 module, you have a basic understanding of the different options. Now we’ll dig into how to choose the right experience for your event.


## Select your event experience

The best tool to use for your event depends on the experience you want for your attendees. The table shows the elements to consider:

:::image type="complex" source="../media/select-experience-matrix.png" alt-text="Grid to select from":::
The table has four columns. From the left the columns are What type of event, What type of attendee experience, How many people will watch the event live, and What level of video production.

Under the columns are three rows. These cells are Single event, Event series, Part of an engagement community, Open two-way discussion, up to 300, and simple webcam and screen share.

### Which Live Event experience should you use

If you've decided that a Live Event is the right choice to deliver your virtual event, you still have a choice on the tools you can use: Teams, Yammer, or Stream.

:::image type="complex" source="../media/live-events-decision-matrix.png" alt-text="A decision matrix that guides the reader through choosing Teams, Yammer, or Stream for your Live Event.":::
This diagram has two paths, if you'll have up to 20,000 people - 10,000 after December 31, 2021 - or you've up to 100,000. For the 20,000 path, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 and no attendee discussion and custom video production then Live Events with Stream is the better option.
:::image-end:::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Attendee limit increases over 10,000 are temporarily available until December 31, 2021.
> ** Stream live events are generally only delivered inside your organization.

Using the decision matrix you can see that for events with up to 20,000 attendees, Live Events in Teams is a good choice if you need to include external people to your organization and need only webcam and screen sharing production. Yammer is better for internal events only with open discussions.

If you need up to 100,000 people viewing, or 20,000 with no attendee discussion and custom video production, then Live Events with Stream is the best option. Remember that Streams can only be used outside your organization with the support of your event from the LEAP team.

## Schedule a Live Event

How you schedule your Live Event depends on where it’s going to be hosted. See how to plan and schedule a Live Event in this video.

## Combination events

Having read about all the different event scenarios and meeting options, you'll see that many events will use a combination of all the above. For example, your summit, may call for a mix of keynotes and multiple, small breakout sessions that support different content tracks. Attendees will likely use Teams to participate in all sessions. Your keynote will use a heavily customized production, using a broadcast-quality video studio with highly moderated chat and Q&A. The content will also be recorded and made available to stream offline by all attendees. For the breakout sessions, attendees will be allowed to share their own content and videos, and the moderators will encourage two-way conversations.
