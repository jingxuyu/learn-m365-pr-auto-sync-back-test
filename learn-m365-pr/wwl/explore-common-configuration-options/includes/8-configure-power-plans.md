As computers have grown more powerful over the years, there power consumption has also grown as well. One of the main concerns with mobile devices that use stored electrical power is that the power in the battery is limited and depletes over time. Another issue for many organizations is the power consumption by all of the different devices that they may own. Conserving power helps to reduce business expenses and benefits the environment.

**Power plans**

You can create power plans in Windows that govern power consumption and operations. By default, there are three preconfigured power plans: Balanced, Power saver, and High performance. You can adjust and save any of these power plans, or create your own power plan. The following table provides details about each plan.

If the computer is a portable device, such as a tablet or laptop, you can use separate settings within each plan for when the device is on battery or plugged in. Because you can adjust and save each plan, there is also an option in the plan to restore default settings. You can use this option to return the plan to where you started.

You can access the power plans by performing the following procedure:

1.  Open the Settings app, select System Category, and then select Power &amp; Sleep.
2.  Select the Additional power settings hyperlink, or alternatively, type Power Plans in the Ask me anything text box on the taskbar. This will open up the Control Panel Power Options page.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, you will see only the Balanced and Power saver plans in the Preferred plans section. If you select the down arrow by the Show additional plans section, the High performance plan appears. The three plans are the Windows default plans. However, any new plans that you create will appear on this page as well.

**Configuration options**

There are different options available in the Setting app�s System Category section, on the Power &amp; Sleep page. The options that are available on your device depend on its hardware configuration. For example, on a laptop or other mobile device, you will have the following configurable options, with a drop down list box for various minutes, hours, and never:

 -  Screen
     -  On battery power, turn off after
     -  When plugged in, turn off after
 -  Sleep
     -  On battery power, PC goes to sleep after
     -  When plugged in, PC goes to sleep after

The Additional power settings hyperlink appears below the settings discussed above, and you can select it to access the Power Options configuration page in the Hardware and Sound section of the Control Panel. The Power Options configuration page includes many options.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all devices will have all of the settings that the following section lists. Several of these settings apply to particular hardware that may not be present on all devices.

On the left side is a list of settings, including:

 -  **Require a password on wakeup**. Use this setting to access the Define power buttons and turn on password protection page. On this page, there is a Password protection on wakeup section that allows you to ensure that when a computer resumes from a hibernated state, the screen is locked until the user presents credentials. This setting is turned on, by default.
 -  **Choose what the power buttons do**. Use this setting to access the Define power buttons and turn on password protection page. Most devices have a power button, and additionally, many have a sleep button. For mobile devices with both power and sleep buttons, both buttons include the On battery and Plugged in columns with four choices: Do nothing, Hibernate, Sleep, and Shut down. Some devices do not have a Sleep or Hibernate option. Certain devices also have a Shutdown settings section on the Define Power buttons and turn on password protection page, which includes check boxes for
     -  **Turn on fast startup**. Allows the Windows operating system to save system information into a file that it uses to start up when you reapply power.
     -  **Sleep**. Suspends power to the hard drive and display, but continues supplying power to the processor and memory.
     -  **Hibernate**. Writes all activity in memory to a file and shuts down all power, but allows the file to reanimate memory with the same values once you supply power.
     -  **Lock**. Locks the screen, and requires the user to reenter credentials before resuming operations.
 -  **Choose what closing the lid does**. Use this setting to access the Define power buttons and turn on password protection page, and drop-down list boxes for On Battery and Plugged in. You also can select an option for Choose what closing the lid does, including Do nothing, Sleep, Hibernate, and Shut down.
 -  **Create a power plan**. When you select this setting, the Create a Power Plan Wizard appears, in which you can select one of the three default power-plan options: Turn off the display, Put the computer to sleep, and Adjust plan brightness. You can save one of these options to a custom name, and then change the default plan settings on the wizard�s Edit Plan Settings page. If you select the Turn off the display and Put the computer to sleep values from a drop-down menu that has options from 1 minute to five hours, or never. You also can configure the Adjust plan brightness setting from fully dim to the highest brightness setting by using its slider bar.
 -  **Choose when to turn off the display**. Use this setting to access the Edit Plan Settings page, which is identical to the one in the Create a Power Plan Wizard.
 -  **Change when the computer sleeps**. This setting is identical to the Choose when to turn off the display setting.

The **Power Options** screen also lists the default and custom power plans. When you select the **Change plan settings** setting and access a particular power plan, the **Change advanced power settings** setting becomes available. This setting opens the **Power Options** window, with a list of options that you can expand and individually select. These options include settings for the battery, hard disk, graphics settings, multimedia settings, and USB, which refers to universal serial bus.
