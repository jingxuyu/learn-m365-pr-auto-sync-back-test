## Integration with Azure AD and Azure Information Protection

In the modern workplace, it's essential to enable users to work from any location and any device and grant them access to cloud applications. Increasing collaboration needs require data to be shared with partners and external collaborators. All the while, businesses need to safeguard their organization’s data and resources.

Defender for Cloud Apps enables businesses to identify sensitive data across cloud apps, monitor when it's shared with risky environments, and take necessary governance actions by classifying, labeling, and protecting existing and new data in your environment.

Defender for Cloud Apps integrates with Azure AD and Azure Information Protection to deliver these capabilities in a holistic and integrated experience. It empowers businesses with a level of granularity when defining what risk means to their organization, and then gain control and visibility of any user sessions that match that definition. For example, if an employee tries to access sensitive files from a personal computer on a public network – the system can be set up to block the download altogether or allow the download.  With Azure Information Protection, the system can be configured to automatically label and protect the file in real time. It allows the business to prevent confidential information from leaking outside of the organization.
