Windows Virtual Desktop on Microsoft Azure is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on the cloud. Windows Virtual Desktop works across devices, like Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, with apps that you can use to access remote desktops and apps. You can also use most modern browsers to access Windows Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences. 

## Improve the user experience

Users have the freedom to connect to  Windows Virtual Desktop with any device over the internet. They use a Windows Virtual Desktop client to connect to their published Windows desktop and applications. This client could either be a native application on the device or the Windows Virtual Desktop HTML5 web client.

You can make sure your virtual machines run near apps and services that connect to your datacenter or the cloud. So users stay productive and don't encounter long load times.

You can provide individual ownership through personal (persistent) desktops. (What does this mean - is like enterprise state roaming)

## Enhance security

Windows Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management  for user's desktops with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can enable multi-factor authentication to secure user sign-ins. You can also secure access to data with role-based access controls.

With Windows Virtual Desktop, the data and apps are separated from the local hardware and runs them instead on remote server. So the risk of confidential data being left on a personal device is reduced.

You don't have to worry as much about the device that's connecting to your virtual desktops. The user's device just needs a secure network connection.
