    questions:
    - content: "When privileged access is approved through Lockbox, the service team engineer is granted the following access:"
      choices:
      - content: "Just-In-Time"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. When a service team engineer requires privileged access, Lockbox can be used to request limited, time-bound access to specific resources."
      - content: "Standing access"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Lockbox is only used to grant Just-In-Time access with Just-Enough-Access for the required task. No Microsoft personnel have standing privileged access to Microsoft 365 systems, and Lockbox cannot be used to grant standing access. "
      - content: "Limited group access"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Only individual service team accounts can request JIT access through Lockbox. Group access is not possible, and shared accounts are prohibited at Microsoft."
      
    - content: "When a Customer Lockbox request is approved by the organization, what is the maximum allowed period for access permissions granted to the service team engineer?"
      choices:
      - content: "4 hours"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Currently, the maximum allowed period for the access permissions granted to the service team engineer is 4 hours. The engineer can also request a shorter period."
      - content: "8 hours"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Currently, the maximum allowed period for the access permissions granted to the service team engineer is 4 hours. The engineer can also request a shorter period."
      - content: "24 hours"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Currently, the maximum allowed period for the access permissions granted to the service team engineer is 4 hours. The engineer can also request a shorter period."
      
    - content: "What kinds of accounts do Microsoft personnel use to manage Microsoft 365 Services?"
      choices:
      - content: "Service accounts"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Service accounts not accessible to Microsoft personnel."
      - content: "Service team accounts"

        explanation: "Correct. Service team accounts are used by individual Microsoft personnel charged with developing, maintaining, and repairing core Microsoft 365 services."
      - content: "Customer accounts"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Customer accounts are provisioned by the customer for users in the customerâ€™s organization."

    - content: "What access control tool in Microsoft requires engineers to specify the privileged role, resources, and time required to complete an administrative task as part of requesting JIT access?"
      choices:
      - content: "Role-Based Access Control"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Role-Based Access Control is used for access permissions but is not a tool for submitting JIT requests."
      - content: "Multi-factor authentication"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Multi-factor authentication is required for all service team accounts but is not a tool for submitting JIT requests."
      - content: "Secure Access Workstations"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Secure Access Workstations limit the attack surface of the devices engineers use to access production environments."
      - content: "Lockbox"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Correct. Engineers use Lockbox to submit Just-In-Time access requests, which must specify the privileged role, resources, and time required to complete an administrative task."
