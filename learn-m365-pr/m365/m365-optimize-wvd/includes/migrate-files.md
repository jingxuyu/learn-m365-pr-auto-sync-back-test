If your current Remote Desktop architecture uses file shares in Windows Server to access shared files, folders, and locations, you can use Azure File Sync to synchronize on-premises file server contents into the same file share location we configured for user profile virtual disks. 

Azure File Sync enables seamless access for files that were initially generated in Azure or on-premises - Windows Virtual Desktop session hosts can access the files from a nearby location stored in Azure. You can also map drives using SMB 3.0 protocols (as you may have already configured if you’re migrating from on-premises Remote Desktop Services infrastructure to Windows Virtual Desktop), so users don’t experience changes in their workflow.  

If you’re already using FSLogix in your on-premises implementation of Remote Desktop Services, you can use Azure File Sync to migrate and synchronize your user profile virtual disks into Azure storage for use with Windows Virtual Desktop.
