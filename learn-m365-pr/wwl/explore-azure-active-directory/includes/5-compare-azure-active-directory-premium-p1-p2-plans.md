The Azure AD Premium tier provides extra functionality as compared to the Free and Office 365 editions. However, premium versions require additional cost per user provisioning. Azure AD Premium comes in two versions–P1 and P2. You can procure it as an extra license or as a part of the Microsoft Enterprise Mobility + Security, which also includes the license for Azure Information Protection and Intune.

Microsoft provides a free trial period that can be used to experience the full functionality of the Azure AD Premium P2 edition. The following features are available with the Azure AD Premium P1 edition:

 -  **Self-service group management**. It simplifies the administration of groups where users are given the rights to create and manage the groups. End users can create requests to join other groups, and group owners can approve requests and maintain their groups’ memberships.
 -  **Advanced security reports and alerts**. You can monitor and protect access to your cloud applications by viewing detailed logs that show advanced anomalies and inconsistent access pattern reports. Advanced reports are machine learning based and can help you gain new insights to improve access security and respond to potential threats.
 -  **Multi-factor authentication**. Full multi-factor authentication (MFA) works with on-premises applications (using virtual private network \[VPN\], RADIUS, and others), Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and third-party Azure AD gallery applications. It doesn't work with non-browser off-the-shelf apps, such as Microsoft Outlook. Full multi-factor authentication is covered in more detail in the following topics in this lesson.
 -  **Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) licensing**. MIM integrates with Azure AD Premium to provide hybrid identity solutions. MIM can bridge multiple on-premises authentication stores such as AD DS, LDAP, Oracle, and other applications with Azure AD. This provides consistent experiences to on-premises line-of-business (LOB) applications and SaaS solutions.
 -  **Enterprise SLA of 99.9%**. You're guaranteed at least 99.9% availability of the Azure AD Premium service. The same SLA applies to Azure AD Basic.
 -  **Password reset with writeback**. Self-service password reset follows the Active Directory on-premises password policy.
 -  **Cloud App Discovery feature of Azure AD**. This feature discovers the most frequently used cloud-based applications.
 -  **Conditional Access based on device, group, or location**. This lets you configure conditional access for critical resources, based on several criteria.
 -  **Azure AD Connect Health**. You can use this tool to gain operational insight into Azure AD. It works with alerts, performance counters, usage patterns, and configuration settings, and presents the collected information in the Azure AD Connect Health portal.

In addition to these features, the Azure AD Premium P2 license provides extra functionalities:

 -  **Azure AD Identity Protection**. This feature provides enhanced functionalities for monitoring and protecting user accounts. You can define user risk policies and sign-in policies. In addition, you can review users’ behavior and flag users for risk.
 -  **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**. This functionality lets you configure additional security levels for privileged users such as administrators. With Privileged Identity Management, you define permanent and temporary administrators. You also define a policy workflow that activates whenever someone wants to use administrative privileges to perform some task.
