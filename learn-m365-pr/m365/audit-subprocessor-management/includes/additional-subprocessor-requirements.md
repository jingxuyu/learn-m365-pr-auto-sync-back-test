While the Microsoft SSPA program provides a comprehensive program for the governance and management of our supplier base, individual business units such as Microsoft 365, may maintain additional requirements for their suppliers. Microsoft 365 maintains a set of requirements for subprocessors besides the ones required through the SSPA program. Microsoft 365 makes commitments to provide notice to customers when new subprocessors are approved and enforces additional checks when contracting with new suppliers. Additional Microsoft 365 supplier requirements are designed to supplement SSPA requirements and align with regulatory requirements.

## Notice requirement

Per the Microsoft Online Services Data Protection Addendum (DPA), Microsoft makes additional commitments regarding notice periods for the addition of any subprocessor. Notice timeframes depend on the type of data the subprocessor will process on behalf of Microsoft.

To summarize what is stated in the DPA, Microsoft commits to providing notice to our customers at least six months in advance of any new subprocessor who will process customer data.  For any other personal data, Microsoft will provide at least 30 days of notice.

## Additional procurement checks for new suppliers

Because of our commitments to limit the number of subprocessors with access to customer and personal data, and to provide notice to customers above and beyond SSPA requirements, we have introduced additional supplier checks for purchase orders that are scoped to include processing customer or personal data. The additional checks ensure these types of purchase orders are not granted to any supplier who has not been approved to process customer or personal data.

When a purchase order is submitted through our purchasing systems, the submitter is presented with a list of questions to identify whether processing of customer or personal data via our online services is within the scope of the purchase order. If processing these kinds of data are in scope, the internal procurement team must first review the supplier against the approved list of suppliers. If the supplier is not on the approved list, the request is rejected with instructions to select from the approved list.
