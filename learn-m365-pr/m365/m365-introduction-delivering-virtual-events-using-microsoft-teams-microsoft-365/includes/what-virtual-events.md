People need to communicate with each other to get their work done. It's hard to match face-to-face meetings, but when your team is distributed globally virtual events are the solution. Microsoft 365 includes Microsoft Teams, which supports many different approaches to hosting virtual events.

As part of the group organizing your virtual summit, you know your project wants to have different kinds of events. You're going to research Microsoft 365 and check it has the tools to support the range of events you're going to produce.

Here you'll define what virtual events mean to your organization, look at the different scenarios, what roles make an event a success, and finally how you can bring these different kinds of interactions together in a combined virtual summit.

## Microsoft Teams meeting vs. Webinar vs. Live Events

Microsoft 365 can scale from the smallest one-to-one video call, to a large-scale public broadcast thousands of attendees. Small scale video calls can be as simple as a Microsoft Teams meeting, whereas webinars can be a combination of live, or pre-recorded content, with the ability to have two-way engagement with the audience. 

If a webinar is the right experience for your event, you can make use of a built-in registration form to find out extra information about your attendees.

To scale up the production of a virtual event to the level of broadcasting to thousands of attendees, Microsoft Teams lets you create **Live Events**. With Teams Live Events, Microsoft gives you more control over production and how your content and presenters are shown to attendees. You can choose the right tool for the size and complexity of your event scenario. You'll need to create your own process to manage attendee registration.

## Event scenarios

A diagram that has five columns. The first shows complexity with simple at the top and an arrow pointing to down to complex. The second column is titled event scenario and lists Team meetings, webinars, virtual conferences, leadership townhall, and public broadcasts. The third column is production level, and lists webcams, could be custom production, and custom production only. The fourth column is attendees with the top value up to 10,000 and the bottom value up to 100,000. The last column is solution, and it lists Live event in Teams, then Live event in Yammer, and the lowest item is Live event in Stream.

The different kinds of virtual event support in Microsoft 365 ranges in complexity. The scenarios are supported by:

- **Team meetings**: Supported using a Teams meeting, with a limit of 1,000 attendees.
- **Webinars**: Individual or series, often destination learning events, that require attendee registration. Can be pre-recorded or live presentations with two-way engagement with attendees (open or moderated).
- **Virtual conferences**: Single or multi-day experiences with multi-track and varying content types, that funnel attendees to online communities for ongoing engagement, as well as moderated Q&A.
- **Leadership townhalls**: 1-to-many delivery with managed Q&A, often set up as moderated destination events and can be part of a regular rhythm of business or on-demand.
- **Public broadcasts**: 1-to-many destination broadcast with optional streaming configurations and may stream to multiple platforms.



## Key roles to make your event a success

The kind of virtual events you're producing will dictate the number and types of roles you need to fill.
