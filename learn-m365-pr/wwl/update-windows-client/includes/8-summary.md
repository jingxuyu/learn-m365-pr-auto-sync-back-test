Microsoft provides several options for Windows updates, giving Administrators flexibility when deciding which methods fit their organization's needs. Windows Updates can be delivered using on-premises solutions such as Windows Server Update Services, or cloud solutions like Windows Update for Business. Organizations using Endpoint Manager can use the same consoles used for OS and applications deployments. Administrators have the ability to roll out updates in stages using rings, and take advantage of features like Delivery Optimization to reduce bandwidth consumption.
