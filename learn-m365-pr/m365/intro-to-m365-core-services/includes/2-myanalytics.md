MyAnalytics accesses data from your use of Office 365 to help you determine how you can become more efficient during your work day. It uses that data to provide insights like:

- **MyAnalytics personal dashboard**. In the MyAnalytics dashboard, you can view statistics on how youâ€™ve spent your time over the past week.
- **Outlook add-in**. The Outlook add-in presents you with interactive insight cards that report on aspects of your recent work experience. <ASHLEY NOTE: MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE HERE>
- **Email digests**. You receive a weekly digest email that gives you highlights about your previous week, like how much time you've spent in meetings. 
- **MyAnalytics nudges**. MyAnalytics nudges are notifications that appear in Microsoft Outlook that can help boost your productivity by displaying useful suggestions and tips around emails, meetings, and to-do tasks.
