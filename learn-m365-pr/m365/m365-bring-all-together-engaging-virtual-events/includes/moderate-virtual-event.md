Next â€“ the moderator. The secret to successful events is having moderators. They help ensure a smooth session by managing the virtual logistics and audience so that the presenter can focus on content. Presenters should not have to think about anything else other than showing up, good audio and video quality, and delivering their content. Moderators improve attendee engagement, minimize load on the technical support staff, and provide event polish with pre-designed introductions and closing messages in larger scale events.

Part of your role on the virtual summit event team is to create and train a team of moderators to support the presenters and technical staff, and to help attendees have a smooth event experience. Here, you'll review moderator best practices to ensure an engaging and successful virtual event.
