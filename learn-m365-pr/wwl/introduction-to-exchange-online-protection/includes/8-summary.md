In this module, you learned that Microsoft 365 tenants that have mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online rely on the Exchange Online Protection (EOP) service to route inbound and outbound mail. EOP is also instrumental in protecting organizations from phishing, spoofing, spam, and malware. EOP provides email security through a combination of techniques. These techniques include:

 -  IP and sender reputation
 -  Heuristics
 -  Spam filtering
 -  Malware filtering
 -  Machine learning
 -  Filtering for phishing and spoofing

This module showed how EOP and Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provide a complete solution for protecting users against cyberthreats originating in email. While the focus of this learning path is on Microsoft Defender for Office 365, this module began by reviewing the capabilities of EOP.

You learned how mail flows through EOP. You also explored the technologies EOP uses to block spam, bulk email, and malware before mail arrives in usersâ€™ mailboxes. This module further investigated EOP to show how it protects organizations from phishing and spoofing, including techniques that administrators can implement to provide further protection.
