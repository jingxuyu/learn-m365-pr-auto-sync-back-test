You needed to show a userâ€™s emails in your app to let them quickly see who they communicated with recently. You built your app so that users can sign in using their Microsoft 365 account. After signing in, you retrieved their latest email messages using Microsoft Graph and provided a way for them to view more messages as well. By using the Microsoft Graph SDK, you can minimize the amount of code you write and focus on building your app.
