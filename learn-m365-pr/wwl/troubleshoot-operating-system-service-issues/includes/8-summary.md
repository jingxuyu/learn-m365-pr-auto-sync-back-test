Windows has several operating system services that run without any user interaction. When these services aren't operating properly, that can affect the user experience. Use the Event Viewer and Log files to identify why a service might have failed. Frequently, a service might be working properly, but uses credentials, which may have changed, and need to be updated. If the service prevents Windows from starting, use Safe mode and Windows RE to boot or adjust configurations.
