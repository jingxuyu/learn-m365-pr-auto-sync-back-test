  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "GPOs are applied in a consistent order that enables organizations to predict which settings are effective when there are conflicting settings in GPOs that apply to a user or computer. What's the order in which GPOs are applied - from first to last?"
    choices:
    - content: "Site GPOs, Local GPOs, OU GPOs, Child OU GPOs, Domain GPOs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't the correct order in which GPOs are applied. Try again."
    - content: "Child OU GPOs, OU GPOs, Domain GPOs, Site GPOs, Local GPOs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't the correct order in which GPOs are applied. Try again."
    - content: "Local GPOs, Site GPOs, Domain GPOs, OU GPOs, Child OU GPOs"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GPOs are applied from the least influential objects to the greatest influential objects in an AD DS environment. A local GPO is the least influential object. That's followed by sites, then domains, then OUs, and then child OUs. Any policies that link to child OUs process last."
  - content: "As the Desktop Administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to link the custom GPOs that she creates to AD DS containers. This will enable her to apply customized settings to the objects in those containers. Which of the following AD DS containers can Holly apply GPOs to?"
    choices:
    - content: "Domains container"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. GPOs can be applied to AD DS sites, domains, and organizational units (OUs). This is referred to as linking. GPOs can't be linked to the default Computers or Users containers in AD DS."
    - content: "Computers container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GPOs can't be applied to the default Computers container in AD DS. Try again."
    - content: "Users container"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. GPOs can't be applied to the default Users container in AD DS. Try again."
  - content: "You're the Desktop Administrator for Northwind Traders. You want to use Windows PowerShell scripts to build automation and complex logic into management tasks. How can you provide this scripting functionality in PowerShell?"
    choices:
    - content: "By running Windows PowerShell ISE"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) provides command-completion functionality, and enables you to see all available commands and the parameters that you can use with those commands. You also can use a scripting window within Windows PowerShell ISE to construct and save Windows PowerShell scripts. Windows PowerShell ISE also provides debugging tools that you can use to debug simple and complex Windows PowerShell scripts."
    - content: "By running Windows PowerShell through a GUI that embeds the shell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Running Windows PowerShell through a GUI doesn't provide a scripting window to create and save PowerShell scripts. Try again."
    - content: "By running the Windows PowerShell command-line interface"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Running the Windows PowerShell command-line interface doesn't provide a scripting window to create and save PowerShell scripts. Try again."
  - content: "As the Desktop Administrator for Woodgrove Bank, Alan Deyoung wants to create a custom Start menu layout for their fleet of Windows 10 devices. However, Alan also wants to provide flexibility by allowing users to customize the Start menu layout that he creates. Which type of Start menu layout should Alan create that meets this requirement?"
    choices:
    - content: "Universal layout"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't a valid Start menu layout. Try again."
    - content: "Full layout"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. When a full layout is applied, the layout is locked. Users can't modify the Start menu, which includes not being able to pin or unpin apps. This may be ideal for scenarios like kiosks, but not for a user's device that has been assigned to them for everyday use. Try again."
    - content: "Partial layout"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Partial layout should be used in scenarios where you want to leverage layout, but still provide flexibility for end users to customize the layout."
  - content: "Which method of Windows activation associates the Windows operating system to the computer system BIOS, which means the license can't be transferred to another computer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Retail"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With the Retail method, any Windows product purchased at a retail store comes with one unique product key that you type in during product installation. You use the product key to complete activation after installing the Windows operating system. Try again."
    - content: "OEM"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. OEM system builders typically sell computer systems that include a customized build of Windows. You can perform OEM activation by associating the Windows operating system to the computer system BIOS, which means that you can't transfer this license to another computer."
    - content: "Microsoft Volume Licensing"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Volume Licensing is a series of software licensing programs that are tailored to the size and purchasing methods of your organization.
