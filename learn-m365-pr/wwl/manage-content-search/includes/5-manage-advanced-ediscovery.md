Organizations must sometimes respond to legal cases involving certain executives or other employees. This process may involve quickly finding and keeping specific information in email, documents, instant messaging conversations, and other content locations used by people in their day-to-day work tasks. Collecting this information can be accomplished through Microsoft 365's Advanced eDiscovery feature.

With Advanced eDiscovery, organizations can better understand their Microsoft 365 data and reduce their eDiscovery costs. Advanced eDiscovery helps organizations analyze unstructured data within Microsoft 365, conduct more efficient document reviews, and make decisions to reduce data for eDiscovery. Advanced eDiscovery helps analyze large data sets and find content thatâ€™s most relevant to a case. It can also organize content, making the legal review process easier and more efficient.

Advanced eDiscovery works with data stored in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Skype for Business, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Microsoft Teams. You can run an eDiscovery search in the Microsoft 365 Compliance center to search for content in groups, individual mailboxes, and sites, and then analyze the search results with Advanced eDiscovery.

> [!TIP]
> When you prepare search results for analysis in Advanced eDiscovery, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) enables the extraction of text from images. This feature enables Advanced eDiscovery's powerful text analytic capabilities to be applied to image files.

Advanced eDiscovery streamlines and speeds up the document review process by identifying redundant information with features like near-duplicates detection and Email Thread analysis. The Relevance feature applies predictive coding technology to identify relevant documents.

Advanced eDiscovery learns from your tagging decisions on sample documents and applies statistical and self-learning techniques to calculate the relevance of each document in the data set. This feature enables you to focus on key documents, make quick yet informed decisions on case strategy, cull data, and prioritize review.

> [!NOTE]
> To analyze a user's data using Advanced eDiscovery, the user (the custodian of the data) must be assigned a Microsoft 365 E5 license. Users with a Microsoft 365 E3 license can be assigned an Advanced eDiscovery standalone license. Administrators and compliance officers who are assigned to cases and use Advanced eDiscovery to analyze data don't need an E5 license.

### Workflow for Advanced eDiscovery

The following diagram illustrates the common workflow for managing and using eDiscovery cases in the Microsoft 365 Compliance center and Advanced eDiscovery.

As Advanced eDiscovery is built on the eDiscovery functionality in the Microsoft 365 Compliance center, the basic steps to create an eDiscovery case remain the same.

After a search that's associated with an eDiscovery case in the Microsoft 365 Compliance center is successfully run, you can prepare the search results for further analysis with Microsoft 365 Advanced eDiscovery. This feature lets you analyze large, unstructured data sets and reduce the amount of data that's relevant to a legal case.

Advanced eDiscovery features include:

 -  **Optical character recognition (OCR).** When you prepare search results for Advanced eDiscovery, OCR functionality automatically extracts text from images and includes it with the search results that are loaded into Advanced eDiscovery for analysis. OCR is supported for loose files, email attachments, and embedded images. This design allows you to apply the text analytic capabilities of Advanced eDiscovery (near-duplicates, email threading, themes, and predictive coding) to the text content in image files.
 -  **Near-duplicate detection.** This feature lets you structure your data review more efficiently so that one person reviews a group of similar documents. This process helps prevent multiple reviewers from having to view different versions of the same document.
 -  **Email threading.** This feature helps you identify the unique messages in an email thread so you can focus on only the new information in each message. In an email thread, the second message contains the first message. Likewise, later messages contain all the previous messages. Email threading removes the need to review every message in its entirety in an email thread.
 -  **Themes.** Themes help you gain valuable insight about your data beyond just keyword search statistics. Themes help investigations by grouping related documents so that you can look at the documents in context. When using themes, you can view the related themes for a set of documents, determine any overlap, and then identify cross-sections of related data.
 -  **Predictive coding.** This feature lets you train the system on what you're looking for, by allowing you to make decisions (about whether something is relevant or not) on a small set of documents. Advanced eDiscovery then applies that learning (based on your guidance) when analyzing all the documents in the data set. Based on that learning, Advanced eDiscovery provides a relevance ranking so that you can decide which documents to review. This ranking is based on its determination as to which documents will most likely be relevant to the case.
 -  **Exporting data for review applications.** You can export data from Advanced eDiscovery and Microsoft 365 after you've completed your analysis and reduced the data set. The export package includes a CSV file that contains the properties from the exported content and analytics metadata. This export package can then be imported to an eDiscovery review application.
