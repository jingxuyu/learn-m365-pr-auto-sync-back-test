Microsoft 365 compliance includes data loss prevention capabilities to help you prevent accidental and intentional data loss for your sensitive information. Sensitive information can include financial data or personal information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or health records. With a data loss prevention (DLP) policy, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Microsoft 365.

Suppose you're the administrator for your organization, responsible for information protection, including preventing inadvertent data loss. This module will walk you through the concepts, procedures, and best practices to configure data loss prevention policies in your organization.
