Audit logging for all workloads across Microsoft 365 can be enabled by turning on this feature in the Microsoft 365 compliance Center. When audit log search is turned on, user and administrator activity from your organization is recorded in the unified audit log and kept for 90 days.

In this module, you examined the steps for searching, viewing, filtering, and exporting the audit log by using the Microsoft 365 compliance center. You also learned how to search the unified audit log by using Windows PowerShell. The module specifically examined the **Search-UnifiedAuditLog** PowerShell cmdlet. This cmdlet enables you to search for events from:

 -  Exchange Online
 -  SharePoint Online
 -  OneDrive for Business
 -  Azure Active Directory
 -  other Microsoft 365 services

This module examined how Microsoft 365 uses the audit log, and how organizations use it to track user activity. You learned about the permissions necessary to search the audit log and how to create audit policies in SharePoint Online.

You then examined how to enter criteria for searching the audit log, and how to view, sort, and filter search results. The module concluded by showing you how to export the search results to a CSV file that can be downloaded for local analysis.
