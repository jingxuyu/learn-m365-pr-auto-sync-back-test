Archiving is referred to in SharePoint as In-Place Records Management. There are two forms of archiving in SharePoint:

 -  You can either manage records in place, which means that you can leave a document in its current location on a site.
 -  You can classify documents as records and store them in a specific archive, such as a Records Center site.

In SharePoint, a record is a document that requires retention for a chosen time period.

In this module, you'll learn how to plan for Records Management in SharePoint. Records Management is designed to archive data that's no longer needed in day to day SharePoint operations. Records management enables you to control content in collaborative spaces.

This design allows certain SharePoint documents (or blogs, wikis, web pages, and list items) to be declared as records. An in-place records management system can also prevent such records from being deleted or edited based upon your organization's definition of what a record is.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the process of in-place records management in SharePoint.
 -  Create a file plan for your organization.
 -  Describe two methods for converting active docs to records.
 -  Explain the benefits of In-Place Records Management.
 -  Configure In-Place Records Management for your organization.
