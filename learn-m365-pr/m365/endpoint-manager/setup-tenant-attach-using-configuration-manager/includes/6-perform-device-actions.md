You need to ensure every device you manage is reachable, no matter where it is or when it connects. You also need to provide each user with everything they need to stay productive, while protecting devices, apps, and data. With the device actions supported by Intune, you can remotely solve these critical functions.

## Perform device actions

You can use the following steps to use device actions:

1. In a browser, navigate [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).
2. Select **Devices** > **All devices** to see the uploaded devices. You'll see **ConfigMgr** in the **Managed by** column for uploaded devices.

3. Select a device to view its **Overview** page.
4. Choose any of the following actions:
   - **Sync Machine Policy**
   - **Sync User Policy**
   - **App Evaluation Cycle**

When you run an action from Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center, the notification request is forwarded to Configuration Manager site, and from the site to the client. These device actions help you manage your organization's endpoints, whether they're on premises or in the cloud, using a single, modern, integrated management platform.
