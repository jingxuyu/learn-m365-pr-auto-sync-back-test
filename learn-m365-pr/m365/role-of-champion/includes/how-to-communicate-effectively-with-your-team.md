Effective communication is a key component of being an OKR Champion and significantly influences the success of the OKR program. As OKR Champions are in charge of training, driving adoption and helping their teams navigate change, the ability to communicate clearly and effectively is crucial.

## Knowing your audience

One of the most important tools in effective communication is knowing your audience. For an OKR Champion, there are three aspects of your audience to consider: their professional role, how they learn, and their personality type.

### Professional role

The information we give and how we give it should be influenced by who we are speaking to. This allows us to address needs or concerns specific to their role. For example, the content of a presentation and how it is delivered would change if it was given to a group of executives versus an engineering team. When we consider someone's role, we can connect the information directly to them.

A helpful way to begin tailoring information to your audience is to consider what is expected of them on a daily basis. How will introducing OKRs help them? What potential blockers or concerns might they have? How strapped is their bandwidth? Can you create space in their schedules so they can feel there is time to learn and adjust to the change being asked of them?

Being aware of what their individual concerns and needs might be will help your team feel more secure and that there is a reasonable path forward for them. This also encourages curiosity, openness, and a growth mindset.

*Learning styles: inclusive communication*
Understanding how to communicate inclusively is the second avenue for knowing your audience. Everyone retains information differently. Some people do best by seeing information, some remember by engaging with stories, or by making task-lists that highlight action items.

Effective communication requires us to teach toward difference, and not only in the way we ourselves learn. This requires both social intelligence and empathy.Â Put differently, effective communication is inclusive communication that strives to be open and accessible to everyone.

OKR Champions should work with their teammates to develop effective communication strategies and should model flexibility when responding to different needs. There is no one-size-fits-all for communicating. This doesn't mean, however, that there aren't useful strategies that help people communicate inclusively.

**Key strategies for inclusive communication include**:

- Vary your method. Use different approaches when possible. Schedule interactive collaborative time with an alternate option for independent working hours, provide visual assets to accompany oral meetings, record meetings and turn on live transcription.
- Follow accessibility guidelines. Take actions like checking documents for reading order, turning on live captions in meetings, and adding alternate text to images. Using tools like Microsoft's Accessibility Checker will ensure your documents are up to industry standards.
- Leverage your colleagues. We all explain things in ways that make sense to our own brains; this means there are often communication breakdowns and struggles in learning new material. Ask your colleagues to put your teaching in their own words. This checks for understanding and widens communication lanes.

The important takeaway is this: we all approach learning differently, and brains work and code information lots of different ways. Inclusive communication is ongoing work that OKR Champions should consistently check.

### Personality types

The last element to consider in knowing your audience is to consider their personality type. Bestselling author Gretchen Rubin has provided one framework called "The Four Tendencies" that proves helpful for professional audiences, especially when introducing change and new information. As OKR Champions do both, this is a particularly powerful framework to know.

In studying how people respond to expectations, change, and new information, Rubin found that there were four broad categories of people: the questioner, the upholder, the obliger and the rebel. Knowing the basics of each personality type and strategies that can be used when working with them helps OKR Champions communicate effectively and keep the team together.

**Questioners** want justifications and are information hounds. Questioners wake up and think, "What needs to get done today?" They're motivated by executing things they endorse and understand. Once you have their buy-in, Questioners are powerful allies and advocates. Conversely, they really don't like spending time and effort on activities they don't agree with. Don't be intimidated by their questions; if they are pressing you, it is likely because they are trying to get on board by making sure they agree with and understand what you are asking.

- **Strategies**:
  - Schedule regular office hours; this will likely minimize work for you as they will realize there is a set time/place for them to ask any questions that come up.
  - Provide contact info for who they can reach out to with questions outside of the classroom.

**Upholders** want to know what should be done. Upholders wake up and think, "What's on the schedule and the to-do list for today?" They're very motivated by getting things done. They really don't like making mistakes, getting blamed, or failing to follow through (if it's on the to-do list, it will get done!). As long as the training was on their schedule, Upholders will most likely be ready to learn and apply new information and practices.

- **Strategies**:
  - Provide all the resources they may need (pdfs, links, decks, etc.).
  - Be clear about asks and action items for them.

**Obligers** are motivated by expectations and rules. Obligers wake up and think, "What must I do today?" They are very motivated by accountability. They really don't like being reprimanded or letting others down. Succeeding with Obligers means setting clear expectations and having built-in accountability.

- **Strategies**:
  - Set guardrails to ensure they stretch themselves (be prepared to need to push them a bit).
  - Schedule regular check-ins to make sure they are on board.

**Rebels** want freedom to do things their own way. They resist most all rules. Rebels wake up and think, "What do I want to do today?" They're very motivated by a sense of freedom and self-determination. You may have a tough time getting buy-in with rebels, but as they are often innovators and leaders, once they adopt it, they will often lead others to do the same. Perseverance is key. Rebels flourish with independence. Honoring this is a great way to keep them on board.

- **Strategies**:
  - Honor their need for independence by asking for their input.
  - Give them small leadership roles (e.g., putting them in charge of breakout rooms, etc.). This encourages buy-in and gives them space to choose into learning for themselves (rather than feeling like it was forced on them)

You won't always know what mix you have in any training but having a reference point for how people may respond differently can help you prepare and meet the needs of your team.

Effective communication requires at least a peripheral understanding of the audience. Doing a bit of work ahead of time to consider the professional roles, the variety of learning styles, and the different personality types present can help OKR Champions tailor their information and communicate more effectively.
