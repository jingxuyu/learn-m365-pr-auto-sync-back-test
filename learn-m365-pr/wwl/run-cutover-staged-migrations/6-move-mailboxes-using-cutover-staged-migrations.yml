quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which of the following items is a prerequisite to creating a migration batch for a cutover or staged migration?"
    choices:
    - content: "Creating a migration endpoint to connect Microsoft 365"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. Creating a migration endpoint to connect Microsoft 365 to your on-premises Exchange server is a prerequisite to creating a migration batch for a cutover or staged migration. Once the batch is created, you must verify this connection. The connection can be verified as a separate task in the EAC or during creation of the migration batch."
    - content: "Enabling Unified Messaging on the mailboxes before you migrate them"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This is incorrect. UM must be disabled on the mailboxes before you migrate them. That being said, UM isn't a prerequisite to creating a migration batch for a cutover or staged migration. Try again."
    - content: "Disabling directory synchronization on the company's Microsoft 365 tenant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. Directory synchronization must be disabled for cutover migrations, but it's required for staged migrations. That being said, directory synchronization isn't a prerequisite to creating a migration batch for a cutover or staged migration. Try again."
