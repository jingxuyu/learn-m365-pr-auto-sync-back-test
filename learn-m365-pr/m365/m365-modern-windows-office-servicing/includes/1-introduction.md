## Introduction to update types
Both Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus introduce new servicing options, support models, and update timelines. These changes simplify the process for staying current on the latest features. Along with these updates, new configuration options provide you with convenient servicing plans. In this module, we’ll cover the update model changes and Microsoft’s recommendations for managing both Windows and Office servicing.

## Update types
Updates fall into two main categories: feature updates and quality and security updates, which contain cumulative security, reliability, and bug fixes. In terms of cadence, both Windows and Office deliver a semi-annual update which delivers new features twice per year around March and September while quality and security updates occur monthly. Additionally, unique to Office 365 applications, Microsoft offers a fully-supported monthly channel option where updates contain both new features and quality updates. Channels are discussed later.

## Feature update benefits
Microsoft has moved away from the past model that introduced huge waves of change around every three years to now incremental smaller changes with feature updates twice per year. With technology trends moving fast and security threats evolving rapidly, this update frequency keeps experiences and protections current. For example, some of the security related updates can’t simply be delivered via monthly security updates or antivirus signature files; they may be low-level platform changes, such as virtualization-based security.

## Cumulative update model benefits
Delivering quality and security updates as a cumulative update package corrects many past issues, from inconsistent and lengthy sets of test matrices for support to hours or days of update time.

With the cumulative model, PCs are always one update away from being current, so the number of monthly updates you need to deploy is reduced. Each update builds upon updates from previous months and contains all the fixes that you need to become current. Cumulative updates are especially helpful when a PC has been turned off for several months.

## Expanded validation of updates
Before updates are rolled out for broad deployment, builds are first released via Insider Programs for Office and Windows. This allows Microsoft to gather diagnostic data and feedback prior to releasing updates broadly. The Insider Programs are open to everyone so members receive early update releases and can validate them on their own systems. By the time updates are released broadly, Microsoft has received diagnostic data from millions of configurations. As a result, update incompatibilities are minimized.
Because Office 365 ProPlus Insider builds reflect monthly channel updates, organizations deploying feature updates through semi-annual channels for Office can validate those builds early as well, using the semi-annual channel (targeted) releases.
