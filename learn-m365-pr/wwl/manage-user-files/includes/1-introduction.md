An organization should have a defined strategy for how files should be stored and managed. Standard best practices are for files to be stored on a file server, cloud service, or some form of redundant storage to ensure data is not loss. Client devices eventually suffer hardware failure, as well as the risk of the device getting stolen or data corruption. End users typically donâ€™t take adequate steps on their own to ensure data is not lost during such an event.

Windows has different options for users to be able to protect files, with minimal to no disruption to the workflows they are accustomed to.
