In the modern workplace, users no longer connect to your systems only from a desktop or laptop computer that you have issued to them. Instead, they connect using phones, tablets, and other devices, some of which they own. In Microsoft Teams you need a way to manage all these devices types.

In your multi-national organization, you've recently conducted a survey to find out how users connect to Teams. You've discovered that they use company-issued computers and their own mobile phones and tablets from various manufacturers. You're concerned that some of these devices may represent a security risk and you want to control the users' access.

Here, you'll learn how to impose configurations on devices that access Teams.

## Management tasks for devices

The Microsoft Teams admin center allows administrators to manage devices that are used with Teams. Management capabilities include:

- Setting up devices. A new device will automatically appear in the Teams Admin Center.
- Granular management. Admins can create and assign configuration profiles, and remotely apply settings on devices.  
- View enrolled devices. Track device inventory using organized views. Admins can scale management operations by using custom tagging.  
- Perform bulk actions. Manage device restarts and apply settings by using filters and search to define groups of devices. 
- Device health monitoring. Including network connectivity, sign-in status, and connected peripherals for Teams Rooms.  
- Alerting capabilities. Including triggering a notification to an IT admin when an issue occurs.  
- Analyze call quality details. investigate and diagnose poor audio calls which can provide insights into additional actions.

For a list of Teams certified devices, see the online documentation.

- Personal devices:
