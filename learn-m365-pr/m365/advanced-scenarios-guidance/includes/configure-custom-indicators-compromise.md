Indicators of compromise provide early warnings and automatic remediation against well-known attacks. Administrators often want to create their own indicators of compromise to protect against new threats.

In Contoso, threat protection is functioning well but you have information about a new malware attack from a trusted security internet source. You have a hash that identifies an executable file, which you expect to see in emails and chat messages in the next few days. You want to use this hash to spot the file as soon as it enters your systems and prevent users from passing the file on or executing it.

Here, you’ll learn how to use policies in Microsoft Cloud App Security to implement a custom indicator of compromise for a new threat.

## What is an indicator of compromise?

When you try to intercept attacks against your network, it’s essential to spot malicious activity early. One way you can configure Cloud App Security to respond quickly to attacks is to define indicators of compromise. An indicator of compromise is an artifact that, when observed, indicates an intrusion with a high level of confidence.
Common indicators of compromise include:

- Virus signatures.
- Blacklisted IP addresses.
- MD5 hashes of known malware files.

Microsoft Cloud App Security includes a broad set of indicators for well-known viruses, IP addresses, and malware, and you can define the actions taken when each indicator of compromise is detected on your network. For example, you could delete a detected malware file or send it to a quarantine folder.

New threats arise all the time, so Cloud App Security allows you to define new indicators of compromise. For example, suppose a security professional you know has recently discovered a new malware file and noticed its potential to recruit compromised computers into a botnet. Your colleague has created and distributed an MD5 hash of the file. You can use this hash to spot the file as soon as it enters your network and take action to block its propagation and functionality.

## Create a custom indicator of compromise

You can create a custom indicator of compromise in Microsoft Cloud App Security in the Polices section of the portal. Follow these steps to use an MD5 hash to protect against malware files:

1. Select **Create policy** and then select **File policy**.

1. In the **Edit file policy** page, in the **Policy name** and **Description** textboxes, enter information to describe this policy to other administrators.
1. In the **Policy severity** drop-down list, select a severity. This setting is used to determine whether the policy will send a notification when a matching file is detected.
1. In the **Category** drop-down list, select the most appropriate risk type. This setting associates this policy and its alerts with that risk type, which helps you to search for them later.
1. In the **Create a filter for the files this policy will act on** box, select **File ID**, and then select **is** in the drop-down lists. Then enter the file hash in the third box.

    You can add multiple file hashes with **OR** conditions to intercept several different files.

1. To filter the policy to work in specific folders, use the first **Apply to** drop-down list. If you want the policy to work throughout your discovered network, select **all files**.
1. To filter the policy to apply to specific file owners, user the second **Apply to** drop-down list. If you want the policy to work for all files regardless of their owner, select **all file owners**.
1. Use the **Alerts** section to govern how Cloud App Security uses alerts when a file matches this policy. For example, you can specify a daily alert limit to avoid flooding mailboxes and choose emails, test messages, or Power Automate as delivery methods.

1. Use the **Governance actions** section to remove the file from circulation. The actions you can take depend on the system where the file is stored. For example, if the file is found in Microsoft SharePoint Online, you can move the file to the recycle bin, or place it into quarantine.
1. To complete the policy, select **Update**.

## Investigate results

Once the policy is created and updated, Microsoft Cloud App Security starts intercepting matching files and taking the governance actions that you specified. When files are deleted or quarantined by these actions, you prevent them from spreading through your organization and protect your users automatically.

It is useful, however, to monitor matched files to assess the effectiveness of your policy and gain information about active threats to your network. In the Microsoft Cloud App Security, matched files will be displayed in the **Alerts** section of the portal. You can see where the file was found, the policy that was matched, and the governance actions that were taken.

If you have integrated Microsoft Cloud App Security with Azure Sentinel, the same alerts can be investigated in Azure portal, under **Azure Sentinel workspaces/Threat management/Incidents**.
