To realize maximum value from Teams, users must actually use it. But getting users to change the way they work isn’t always easy. Taking time to understand your users and design the right readiness plan can help facilitate change and accelerate adoption of Teams. These activities should be completed in parallel with your technical readiness preparation:

•	Assessing organizational change readiness: This includes understanding who your users are, how they’ll use the new technology, and how readily they adapt to change. This is also an opportunity to identify specific user profiles who would benefit from focused onboarding.

•	Preparing a user readiness plan: Consisting of awareness, training, and support activities, your readiness plan should address both your broad user base and targeted profiles, as identified in the assessing change readiness article.

## Assess organizational change readiness
Simply enabling Teams doesn’t guarantee that you achieve your goal. Users have different use cases and varying learning styles, and they adapt to new technology at different speeds. Managing change isn’t all that complicated, but it does take a focused effort. The guided discussions below are designed to help you understand your user base so that you can prepare the right level of education to facilitate and accelerate user adoption. There are two ways you should look at your user base: organizational change readiness and assessing teamwork scenarios.

•	**Organizational change readiness** By assessing your organization’s readiness, you can determine how receptive (or not) your users are likely to be to changing the way they work and adopting new technology. Understanding how users react to change empowers your organization to proactively address concerns, adjust your rollout plan to get optimal buy-in, and identify users who can actually help you facilitate the change with their peers. 

•	**Assessing teamwork scenarios** As you plan for upgrading users from Skype for Business to Teams, consider how you can use the power of teamwork collaboration to both excite users and facilitate their transition from Skype for Business to Teams.

Understanding how users work and how they come together can help users visualize how they can use Teams, facilitating the shift away from Skype for Business. There are two core ways to think about teamwork scenarios: people-centric and project-centric.

•	**Project-centric teamwork** centers on a specific project or initiative (for example, planning a product launch event). From scope planning to budget management to marketing efforts, project-centric teamwork helps align project workstreams, keeping everyone informed.

•	**People-centric teamwork** revolves around people with similar responsibilities or attributes who might work on the same team (for example, the sales team, road warriors) or across teams (for example, peer champions). From chatting with a colleague to get an answer to a question to participating in a team meeting, people-centric activities include information sharing and rapport building.
To get the most out of Teams, build a teamwork strategy that includes both scenarios, helping users understand how Teams can work for them.

## Prepare a user readiness plan
An optimal user readiness plan incorporates how you’ll communicate with, train, and support your users as you pilot, onboard, and upgrade to Teams. As you discovered in Assess organizational change readiness, readiness is not one-size-fits-all. To ensure optimal receptiveness to the new technology, use a combination of broad-reach messaging (incorporating the vision/value messaging and universal use cases) and messaging, training, and support tailored to the personas and cohorts you’ve defined and also to your laggards, as appropriate. This personalized plan will help facilitate user adoption by enabling users to more quickly relate to Teams, while demonstrating that you understand their needs.
