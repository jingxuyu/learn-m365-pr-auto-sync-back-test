As organizations move more of their workload to the cloud, they can now have employees work from any location and on any device. Microsoft, as both a cloud provider and operating system (OS) provider, has built comprehensive cloud computer management solutions. These solutions provide IT departments with remote computer configurations and simplified management tools.

Microsoft Endpoint Manager helps you better deploy and manage your organizationâ€™s devices and Microsoft 365 Apps, all while delivering a better end-user experience. Windows-as-a-service is a way to simplify the lives of IT pros and maintain a consistent Windows experience for its users through more frequent updates. Windows 365, the new Cloud PC, securely streams your personalized Windows experience including all your apps, content, and settings, to any device. Azure Virtual Desktop, a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solution, allows you to quickly deploy virtual desktops and apps to enable secure remote work. These solutions enable you to meet the security and productivity needs while providing a streamlined user experience in a changing workforce.
