## Microsoft Teams reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center

You can use activity reports in the Microsoft 365 admin center to see how users in your organization are using Microsoft Teams. 

For example, if someone don't use Microsoft Teams yet, they might not know how to get started or understand how they can use Teams to be more productive and collaborative. Your organization can use the activity reports to decide where to prioritize training and communication efforts.

To view the activity reports, you will need one of the following permissions:

- Global admin role
- Product-specific admin role (Teams, Exchange, Skype for Business, or SharePoint)
- Reports reader role

The following are steps to see the Microsoft Teams reports in Microsoft 365 admin center:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Reports** > **Usage**.

2. On the **Usage** page, choose **Select a report**, and then under **Microsoft Teams** in the list of reports, choose the report you want to view.  

There are currently two activity reports you can view:

### Microsoft Teams user activity report
The Teams user activity report gives you a view of the most common activities that your users perform in Teams. This includes how many people engage in a chat in a channel, how many communicate via private chat message, and how many participate in calls or meetings. You can see this information for your whole organization, and for each individual user.

### Microsoft Teams device usage report 

The Teams device usage report provides you with information about how your users connect to Teams, including mobile apps. The report helps you understand which devices are popular in your organization and how many users work on the go.

### View usage information for a specific user

Use the service reports to research how much a specific user is using the service. For example, to find out how much mailbox storage a specific user has consumed, open the Mailbox usage report, and sort the users by name. If you have thousands of users, export the report to Excel so you filter through the list quickly.

You can't generate a report where you enter a user's account and then get a list of which services they are using and how much.

There are circumstances where new users show up as **unknown**. This is due to occasional delays in creating user profiles.

### What happens to usage data when a user account is closed?

Whenever you close a user's account, Microsoft will delete that user's usage data within 30 days. That user will still be included in the Activity chart totals for the periods the user was active in, but will not appear in the User Details table.

However, when you select a particular day, up to 28 days from the current date, the report show the user's usage for that day in the User Details table.
