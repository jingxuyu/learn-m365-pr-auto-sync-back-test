How long do you have to recover the deleted account before it can no longer be restored?"
    choices:
    - content: "45 days"

    - content: "60 days"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The length of time you have to recover the deleted account before it can no longer be restored isn't 60 days. Try again."
