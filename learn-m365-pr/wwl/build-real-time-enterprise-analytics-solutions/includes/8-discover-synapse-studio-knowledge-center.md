To further accelerate time to insight in Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics, the Knowledge center simplifies access to pre-loaded sample data and streamlines the getting started process for data professionals. You can now create or use existing Spark and SQL pools, connect to and query Azure Open Datasets, load sample scripts and notebooks, access pipeline templates, and tour the Azure Synapse Studioâ€”all from one place.

The Knowledge center allows you to do three things:

- Use samples immediately. If you want a quick example of how Synapse works, choose this option.

- Browse gallery. This option lets you link sample data sets and add sample code in the form of SQL scripts, notebooks, and pipelines.

- Tour Synapse studio. This option takes you on a brief tour of the basic parts of Synapse Studio. This is useful if you have never used Synapse Studio before.
