### **View the health status of Microsoft 365 services**

It's crucial for an organization to know the health status of the Microsoft 365 services they're using. Your organization’s administrators can use the Microsoft 365 admin center to view the current health status for each of your Microsoft 365 services and tenant. They can also view the history of services that have been affected in the last 30 days, and information about current outages or disruptions to services. Viewing the health is useful to find out whether you're dealing with a known issue that has a solution in progress so you don't have to spend time troubleshooting or calling support.

To view service health, go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/?azure-portal=true). Select **Health** under the left navigation pane then S**ervice health.** You can also select the service health card on the home dashboard.

If your organization is experiencing a service issue, your administrators can report it by selecting **report an issue** and completing a short form. Administrators can also view specific details about other service issues, like what kind of impact an issue may be having on the service by selecting I**ncidents** or A**dvisories**.

### Keep track of incidents

Your organization can set up notifications for any new incidents, or notifications for updates to any active incidents that might affect your organization. Microsoft will provide two different types of notifications:

 -  **Unplanned downtime**: Where an incident has caused a service to become unresponsive or unavailable.
 -  **Planned maintenance**: Where Microsoft regularly carries out service updates to the software and infrastructure that run services.

Microsoft also analyzes unplanned service incidents for you through Post-Incident Reviews. Through these reviews, you’ll receive a preliminary review within the first two days of incident resolution, and a final review within five business days. Final Post-Incident Reviews will detail the following information:

 -  How you might have been impacted, and how the user experience was impacted.
 -  A date and time breakdown detailing when an incident started and when it was resolved.
 -  An analysis of the root cause, and what actions are to be carried out to prevent the incident in the future.

Your organization can keep track of the health status of services in different ways:

### Continuity and availability

Microsoft services run on highly resilient infrastructures and systems to keep up peak service demand and performance. This infrastructure makes it possible for Microsoft to rapidly recover services from unexpected issues whether they're hardware related issues, software related issues, or even catastrophic issues like natural disasters.

For example, to protect and keep your organization’s data available Microsoft does the following list:

 -  **Data storage redundancy**: Microsoft stores your data through multiple levels of redundancy using data replication and secure data protection capabilities. These capabilities make it possible to ensure rapid availability and recovery of your data.
 -  **Monitoring data**: Your databases are monitored for you. Your data is monitored packet loss, latencies in queries, and more.
 -  **Preventative measures**: Microsoft regularly carries out checks for database consistency, reviews of error logs, and more.
