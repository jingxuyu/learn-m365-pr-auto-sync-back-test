In Contoso, you had a successful deployment of Microsoft Cloud App Security but you had identified some weak points in your defenses. For example, iOS devices were not protected, and there was no single location where you could observe security data from all the relevant products. By using advanced features of Microsoft Cloud App Security, you were able to close these loopholes and tighten security in your organization.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Create a custom indicator of compromise in Microsoft Cloud App Security.
- Observe security threats detected by Microsoft Cloud App Security in Microsoft 365 security center.
- Block apps and websites on iOS devices by using Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Cloud App Security.
- Ensure that a log collector can communicate with Microsoft Cloud App Security from behind a proxy server.
- Interact with Microsoft Cloud App Security by using the Microsoft Cloud App Security API.
