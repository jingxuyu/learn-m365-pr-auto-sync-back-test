This module introduced the methodology of device management known as Co-management. To help you understand co-management, the module provided a brief history of where device management started and where it stands today.

You learned that Windows devices were traditionally managed in on-premises domain environments by using Group Policy and Configuration Manager. IT traditionally built and maintained its infrastructure in its own on-premises data center. This design enabled it to deliver services like Microsoft's Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). AD DS is used for providing identity management, but also for providing access to company resources, file services, and applications.

With the introduction of cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings, many companies have been moving their services and applications to the cloud. In doing so, on-premises AD DS often becomes connected to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and many companies started using Microsoft 365 as their messaging and collaboration solution.<br>

You learned that there are many facets in this transition from traditional device management with on-premises infrastructure to cloud services:<br>

 -  Identity and access management moves from on-premises AD DS to Azure AD.
 -  Legacy app management moves to SaaS solutions that handle messaging, security, and other needs.
 -  Microsoft moves IT management workloads into their cloud-based services, such as the Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) suite.<br>

Co-management is the first and fundamental step in this journey. With co-management, you can use existing Windows devices and configurations, but at the same time add a modern Mobile Device Management (MDM) management tool.

This module introduced you to co-management and the benefits it provides to organizations. You began by learning how to plan a strategy for implementing co-management. The module then introduced you to device management using Configuration Manager. You also learned how to enable co-management by using Azure AD.
