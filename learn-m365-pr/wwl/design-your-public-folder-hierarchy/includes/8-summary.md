This module examined the use of public folders in Exchange. It reviewed the planning considerations for deploying public folders, and it explored alternatives to public folders.

Exchange Server and Exchange Online fully support public folders. In this module, you learned that public folders are designed for shared access. They provide an easy and effective way to collect, organize, and share information with other people in your workgroup or organization. Public folders help organize content in a deep hierarchy thatâ€™s easy to browse.

You also learned that public folders can be used as an archiving method for distribution groups. When you mail-enable a public folder and add it as a member of the distribution group, email sent to the group is automatically added to the public folder for later reference.
