This module examines how organizations can use eElectronic discovery, or eDiscovery, to identify and deliver electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases.

Microsoft Purview provides three eDiscovery solutions: Content search, eDiscovery (Standard), and eDiscovery (Premium). Each solution builds upon its predecessor.

 -  A previous training module examined how to use the Content search tool to search for content across Microsoft 365 data sources and then export the search results to a local computer.
 -  This module explores how eDiscovery (Standard) builds on the basic search and export functionality of Content search. It enables organizations to create eDiscovery cases and assign eDiscovery managers to specific cases. eDiscovery (Standard) also lets you associate searches and exports with a case. It also lets you place an eDiscovery hold on content locations relevant to the case.
 -  A later training module examines how eDiscovery (Premium) uses advanced features to build on the existing case management, preservation, search, and export capabilities in eDiscovery (Standard).

In this module, you'll learn how to use eDiscovery tools in Microsoft Purview to search for content in:

 -  Exchange Online
 -  SharePoint Online
 -  OneDrive for Business
 -  Microsoft Teams<br>
 -  Microsoft 365 Groups
 -  Yammer teams

The module explores how to search mailboxes and sites in the same eDiscovery search, and then export the search results. You'll also learn how to use Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) cases to identify, hold, and export content found in mailboxes and sites. Holds preserve content that may be relevant to a case. In this module, you'll learn how to create an eDiscovery hold that's associated with an eDiscovery case. You'll also learn how to remove a content location from an eDiscovery hold.

The module also examines how to search for and export content in a case. After a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) case is created and people of interest in the case are placed on hold, an organization can create and run one or more searches for content relevant to the case. And after an organization successfully runs a search associated with a Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) case, the company can export the search results. The module concludes by examining how to close, reopen, and delete a case.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard) builds on the basic search and export functionality of Content search.
 -  Describe the basic workflow of eDiscovery (Standard).
 -  Create an eDiscovery case.
 -  Create an eDiscovery hold for an eDiscovery case.
 -  Search for content in a case and then export that content.
 -  Close, reopen, and delete a case.
