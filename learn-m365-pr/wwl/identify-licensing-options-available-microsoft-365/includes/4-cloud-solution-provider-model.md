## Cloud solution provider model

With the cloud solution provider (CSP) model, your subscription is provided through an expert CSP partner who can manage your whole Microsoft 365 subscription, licenses and settings, and provide tier 1 support.

The CSP partner can provide additional consultancy and advice to ensure security and productivity targets are met. The Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program provides a pay-as-you-go subscription model for Windows 10 with per-user, per-month pricing that enables your business to scale up or down from month to month as your needs change.

Furthermore, additional Microsoft cloud-based products and services can be added to the subscription such as Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure services.
