You've now learned about automated investigation and remediation. But you also need to know about the tasks you'd carry out to use it properly. For example, how do you keep track and manage automated actions? And how can you find investigation results?

Here, you'll learn how to review investigation results and remediation actions in automated investigation and remediation.

## Review remediation actions

You track remediation actions from the Action center in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You use the information in the Action center to review your remediation actions for your automated investigations.
You can review both pending and completed actions from the Action center. You access the Action center by selecting **Action center** in the navigation pane:

You can find completed actions from the **History** tab. To review a completed action, you select it from the **History** tab. You can then review detailed information about your chosen action:

You use the investigation page to access:

- An investigation graph that maps the relationship between affected entities and how a threat has been remediated across entities.
- Investigation details such as its status, the severity of the threat, and more.
- A timeline to help you understand when a threat was identified and how long it has taken to remediate the threat.
