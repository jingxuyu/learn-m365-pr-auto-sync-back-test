A record is a document or other electronic or physical entity in an organization that serves as evidence of an activity or transaction performed by the organization and requires retention for some time period. Microsoft’s solution for records management helps organizations manage their legal obligations, provides the ability to demonstrate compliance with regulations, and increases efficiency with regular disposition of items that are no longer required to be retained. It supports the full content lifecycle, from creation, through collaboration, record declaration, event-based retention, and disposition. Tailored workflows, like disposition review, coupled with deep insights, provide greater visibility into remediation. Records management in Microsoft 365 helps organizations maintain a robust records management program and document evidence related to the defensible disposition of corporate records. Many of the same principles of the solution for information governance also apply to the solution for records management, but there are some differences. Those differences include file plan, record declaration, and record versioning.

## File plan
Records management introduces the concept of a file plan. A file plan specifies how your records are organized and their retention schedule. You can create your own retention labels or import them into your file plan, and author policies to publish or auto-apply those labels to your content.

## Record declaration
The ability to declare an item as a record  is at the heart of records management. You can determine where, when, and how your records are retained, and attend to new and pending disposition alerts. Declaring an item as a record means it becomes immutable and cannot be modified (with the exception of the name and metadata in SharePoint Online and OneDrive) or deleted until after the retention period has passed. 

## Record versioning
Record versioning in SharePoint Online and OneDrive lets you work on a document, even after it has been declared as a record. For example, you might want to declare a specific revision of a document as a record but want to make additional modifications after giving it that designation. Record versioning is automatically available for any document with a retention label that declares the item as a record. 

## Customer scenarios
Here is some common scenarios Microsoft’s solution for records management can address:
- Delete employee reviews 10 years after the employee has left the organization.
- Declare a contract as a record to prevent it from being changed.  

## Getting started with records management
While careful planning should be a part of each information protection and governance solution, this is especially true of records management. This section includes some general guidance on where to get started with records management and is not meant to be a substitute for developing a more thorough plan involving subject matter experts and stakeholders.

Many organizations already have a file plan (which includes a retention schedule)   and will start with that as the first step in getting started with records management in Microsoft 365. Organizations without a file plan should start with developing one. Microsoft includes a template and wizard that simplifies the process of importing your file plan into Microsoft 365. 

Here are some common things a typical file plan includes:
- Content in your organization to declare as records for legal, regulatory, compliance, business, or other reasons.
- Format of the content to be kept as records.
- Categorization of the documents into broad categories based on your business requirements.
- Locations where records are stored.
- Retention period (schedule) for records.
- How records should be disposed of after retention period.
- Responsible party for managing of different types of records.
