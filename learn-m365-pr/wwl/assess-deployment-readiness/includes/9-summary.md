When preparing for a deployment, a proper plan will minimize unexpected issues. It's important to have a detailed inventory of the hardware and software currently in-use. Tools such as Microsoft Endpoint Manager, Desktop Analytics, and Endpoint Analytics can help identify potential challenges, allowing Administrators to be proactive in mitigating these issues, such as application incompatibilities. When planning a large deployment, consider your infrastructure and staff capacity. Take advantage of features such as Delivery Optimization. Plan a phased approach to identify unexpected issues early, and ensure the people supporting the deployment don't become overwhelmed.
