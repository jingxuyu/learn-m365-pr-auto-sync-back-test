  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "You have deployed several defense mechanisms to protect users from Phishing attacks. However, some users are still falling prey to these attacks. Which of the following statements will help educate your users about Phishing?"
    choices:
    - content: "Scammers imitate someone you know, so verify their email address rather than contact information or brand accuracy"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Spoofing also can occur when a scammer imitates someone you know by mimicking their email address. Always check that the address you’re replying to is the correct one. However, you should also look for company contact information and brand accuracy. Most companies will have a brand identity that is recognizable in their emails. Look for logos, brand colors and contact information in the message. Try again."
    - content: "Hover over links to uncover the URL"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Always check a URL before you select on the link. Bad links are sometimes embedded into an email as a way to trick the reader."
    - content: "Phishing scams are exclusively perpetrated in email"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Phishing is a type of online identity theft. It uses email, phone calls, texts, and fraudulent websites that are designed to steal your personal data or information such as credit card numbers, passwords, account data, or other information. Try again."
  - content: "Northwind Traders has recently been the victim of several cyber security attacks. The attackers have used eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks to steal data in transit across the Internet. Which of the following defense mechanisms can help mitigate the risk of these attacks?"
    choices:
    - content: "Intrusion detection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it's important to monitor your network regularly for signs of attack, Northwind Traders is looking for a way to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks to steal data in transit across the Internet. Try again."
    - content: "Domain Name System Security Extensions"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While it's important to monitor your DNS servers and resolvers to proves that no DNS data modification or tampering has occurred, Northwind Traders is looking for a way to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks to steal data in transit across the Internet. Try again."
    - content: "VPNs and DirectAccess"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. It's important that users have the ability to connect to their organization’s intranet from the Internet as securely as possible. The Internet is a public network, and data in transit across the Internet is susceptible to eavesdropping or MITM attacks. However, by using virtual private networks (VPNs) or DirectAccess, you can authenticate and encrypt connections between remote users and your organization’s intranet. This can help to mitigate risk."
  - content: "Hackers recently attacked Trey Research by overloading its DNS system with a large number of fake requests. The purpose of this attack was to overload and shut down the server that hosts DNS. What is this common network security threat known as?"
    choices:
    - content: "Man-in-the-middle attack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, the network attacker uses a computer to impersonate a legitimate host on the network with which your computers are communicating. The attacker intercepts all of the communications that are intended for a destination host. Try again."
    - content: "Denial of service attack"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This type of attack limits the function of a network app, or renders an app or network resource unavailable. Hackers typically perform DoS attacks by overloading a service that replies to network requests, such as Domain Name System (DNS), with a large number of fake requests in an attempt to overload and shut down a service or the server that hosts the service. A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a version of a DoS attack."
    - content: "Brute force network attack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Try again."
  - content: "Fabrikam is looking to update their antiquated system design. They currently connect their host servers directly to the Internet. While this makes their hosts servers available to Internet users, it also allows those users access to Fabrikam's corporate intranet. Which of the following defense mechanisms should they implement to resolve this issue?"
    choices:
    - content: "Perimeter networks"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Perimeter networks, which are isolated areas on your network to and from which you can define network traffic flow. When you need to make network services available on the Internet, it is not advisable to connect hosting servers directly to the Internet. However, by placing these servers in a perimeter network, you can make them available to Internet users without allowing those users access to your corporate intranet."
    - content: "Internet Protocol security (IPsec)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. IPsec authenticates IP-based communications between two hosts and, where desirable, encrypts that network traffic. While this is a valid defense mechanism, there's another solution more applicable to Fabrikam's problem. Try again."
    - content: "Firewalls"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Firewalls allow or block network traffic based on the type of traffic. While this is a valid defense mechanism, there's another solution more applicable to Fabrikam's problem. Try again."
  - content: "A hacker has captured network packets that workstations connected to your network send and receive. You have concerns that your organization’s sensitive data has been compromised. What is this kind of network-based security threat known as?"
    choices:
    - content: "Man-in-the-middle attack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. With a man-in-the-middle attack, The network attacker uses a computer to impersonate a legitimate host on the network with which your computers are communicating. The attacker intercepts all of the communications that are intended for a destination host. Try again."
    - content: "Port scanning"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Apps that run on a computer using the TCP/IP protocol use Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports to identify themselves. With port scanning, attackers exploit a network by querying hosts for open ports on which they listen for client requests. Once attackers identify an open port, they can use other attack techniques to access the services that are running on the computer. Try again."
    - content: "Eavesdropping"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. An eavesdropping attack, also known as network sniffing, occurs when a hacker captures network packets that workstations connected to your network send and receive. Eavesdropping attacks can compromise your organization’s sensitive data, such as passwords, which can lead to other, more damaging attacks."
