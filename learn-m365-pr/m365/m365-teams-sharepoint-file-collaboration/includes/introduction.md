With Microsoft 365 services, you can create a secure and productive file collaboration environment for your users. While SharePoint contains the actual files, the capabilities of file collaboration in Microsoft 365 extend to Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and a variety of governance and security options as well.

Administrators have many options and decisions to consider when setting up a collaboration environment, including:

- How to manage access and sharing across team sites, Microsoft 365 Groups, and Teams.
- How to configure file and folder sharing for the best user experience while keeping your confidential information safe.
- How to provide access to guests.
