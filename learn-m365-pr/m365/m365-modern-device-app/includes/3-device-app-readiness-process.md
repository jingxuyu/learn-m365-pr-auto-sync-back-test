Device and app readiness is comprised of four steps: 
1. Inventory 
2. Prioritize 
3. Test 
4. Remediate 

## 1. Inventory
Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness service uses an agent-less process to inventory the computers, applications, and Office add-ins across your desktop estate. It also provides reports on highly visited Internet sites, apps, and Intranet locations to help you with compatibility testing later. Additionally, to assist in your move to Office 365 ProPlus, you may wish to make use of the Readiness Toolkit for Office to test the compatibility of your add-ins and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.

## 2. Prioritize
With inventory taken, Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness helps you to identify and prioritize the most common apps and hardware used in your organization, as well as what to focus on to unblock as many PCs as possible for deployment. The Readiness Toolkit for Office will also provide inventory data on the most commonly used add-ins and macros. By prioritizing the most impactful remediation items in your organization you can build a deployment plan that allows for devices to begin migrating to Windows 10 or Office 365 ProPlus while those needing additional support can be addressed. The inventory also provides guidance to help you assess the updates necessary to resolve issues during the next step: testing.

## 3. Testing
You will find that most of the applications, drivers, and add-ins inventoried will work as-is. For items Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness or the Readiness Toolkit for Office assesses to have issues, it provides you with known information including where to find version updates to resolve compatibility problems. Rather than devoting time and resource resolving complex issues in non-critical, sparsely deployed applications and older devices, you may choose instead to work with users to retire and replace these items.

Windows Analytics Upgrade Readiness assesses browser-based compatibility issues too, identifying websites and web apps accessed by users still using ActiveX controls, Browser Helper Objects, VBScript, or other legacy technology not supported by the Microsoft Edge browser. Your users will still need to use Internet Explorer 11 for these sites, and you can add them to the Enterprise Mode site list, using the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager.

## 4. Remediation
The final phase of device and app readiness is to *remediate*. Here you’ll want to collect the required software or driver packages; you are going to use these to supersede or update older versions as part of the deployment process. As you work through the list remediating issues, you’ll see that more and more PCs become “Ready for Deployment” to start your deployment process. This means that both the drivers and apps on the PCs are noted as compatible with the version of Windows 10 you are targeting for deployment.
