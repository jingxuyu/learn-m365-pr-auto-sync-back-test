The Office Add-ins platform provides add-in commands so users can activate an add-in that opens a task pane or runs code behind the scenes (UI-less command). You can configure your add-in so the Office application renders a custom ribbon or menu command button&mdash;or even a group of buttons&mdash;depending on the tasks your add-in is making available to users.
