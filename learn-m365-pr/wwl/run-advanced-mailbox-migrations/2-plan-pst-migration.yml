  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to bulk-import PST files to Exchange Online using the PST Import tool. While planning this migration, Holly has come to realize there are far more PST files than what was originally expected. Many of the files are also large in size. Given this information, what's the recommended approach that Holly should follow to import the data to Microsoft 365?"
    choices:
    - content: "Upload the PST files to the Import service using Contoso's existing Internet connection"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This method isn't the recommended approach when dealing with many PST files, or files that are large in size. Try again."
    - content: "Store your PST files on an encrypted hard drive, send it to Microsoft, and have Microsoft upload the data"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "This answer is correct. This drive shipping option is especially useful if you have many PST files, or the files are large in size, either of which could cause a network upload to take many days or weeks to complete. With this option, you can store your PST files on an encrypted hard drive and physically ship the drive to Microsoft. This option saves you from having to transfer the data over the Internet using the Network Upload option."
    - content: "Use a third-party bulk transfer tool to upload the files to Microsoft 365"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "This answer is incorrect. This method isn't an available option with the Import tool. Try again."
