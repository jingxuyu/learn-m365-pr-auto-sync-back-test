Administrators in the following three roles manage the Search & intelligence settings and content experience for Microsoft Search: 

**Global admin**: Has complete control over and access to Search & intelligence features and all other enterprise apps and services that contribute to the Microsoft Search experience. This includes settings for branding, news feed, and the Bing homepage. Only a Global admin can assign the roles of Search admins or Search editors.

**Search admin**: Can create and manage answer content and settings, add connectors to make more data accessible, and make other configurations and customizations. They can perform all of the content-management tasks a Search editor can.

**Search editor**: Typically tasked with the management of answer content such as bookmarks, acronyms, and Q&As.

> Only Global admins, User admins, and Groups admins can create and manage groups in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Assigning roles

The IT admin from our scenario has recruited someone from the team to manage and create Microsoft Search content. The organizationâ€™s Global admin wants to assign a Search admin role to them. Here's how:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), select **Users** > **Active Users**.
2. Choose a user account, then in the details pane select **Manage roles**.

3. Select **Admin center access**.
4. Expand **Show all by category** to display a list of predefined specialty roles.
5. The **Collaboration** section appears at the top of the expanded list. In this section, you'll see two search-specific roles: **Search admin** and **Search editor**.
