Microsoft Teams is available across mobile, desktop, and browser platforms. It's integrated with communications and meeting-room devices, for a frictionless experience no matter which device users work from.

Teams has desktop clients available for Windows, Mac, and Linux as well as web clients and mobile clients for Android and iOS. While each of these clients require an active internet connection, desktop clients support a limited offline mode. Microsoft also offers Teams for Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments.

By default, Teams is turned on for all organizations. Administrators can assign user licenses to control individual access to Teams and allow or block what content sources are used.
