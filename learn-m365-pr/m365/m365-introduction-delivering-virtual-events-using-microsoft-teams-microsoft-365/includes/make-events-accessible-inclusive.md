Every event, whether virtual or in-person, needs to be made accessible to all. As your prepare the content and people for your up-and-coming virtual event, you intend to ensure it is as accessible and engaging as possible.

Here you'll explore how to design for accessibility, with a focus on the logistics and content being presented.

## Event Design Model

<div align="center">

:::image type="complex" source="../media/event-design-model.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the event design model" border="false":::

A circular diagram with arrows pointing around it to each component of the design model. From the top the components circle clockwise from Awareness, Core Message, Education, Engagement Strategy, Intent & conversation, Content Production, Engagement, Talent & Tools, Satisfaction, and Audience Profile. In the circle are four more icons from the top they're Accessibility, Inclusivity, Technology, and Model. At the center of the diagram is Audience Experience with people smiling.

Making your event a success means making it the best it can be for as many people as possible. You could lose possible future attendees if you don't pay attention to accessibility from the start of your event planning.

Use the above event design model from Microsoft to guide you through thinking about how to get people to attend your event, enjoy participating in your event, and get feedback to improve your future events.

- **Awareness**: How will you make your attendees aware your event is happening? What is the core message you want to deliver?
- **Education**: Inform potential attendees about why they should attend, and what they'll gain from attendance. How will you engage with your people?
- **Intent**: If they're aware, and know why they should attend, people need to act on their intent to attend.
- **Conversion**: Converting them from possible to registered attendees, reduce friction in the sign-up process. As you begin to register attendees and their preferences, begin to build or adapt your content with a focus on them.
- **Engagement**: During the event, provide multiple ways for your attendees to engage with the content. Have you trained your presenters and moderators on all the tools they need to succeed?
- **Satisfaction**: If your event is a success, attendees will be satisfied, and hopefully recommend future events to others. What was your audience profile, can you gather metrics on their diversity?

## Event accessibility

Accessibility and inclusivity begins with your event planning. Building on the event design model above, your advertising and promotion of the event needs to be accessible to people of all abilities. The text and images used should apply accessibility best practices where possible:

- Sans serif fonts are easier for a wide variety of reading levels
- Use larger fonts for the key information
- Color contrast of 4.5:1 for smaller text, and 3:1 for large text
- Unjustified text is more legible as readers are less likely to lose their place
- Try to use Personal First Language when referring to specific abilities (for example engineer with dyslexia rather than dyslexic person)

Next focus on the actual invite you send to people, normally via email. Keep the above in mind but also avoid using images only to convey information. If you do use any images in digital media, these should all have alternative text.

You can also begin to capture any accessibility accommodations that your potential attendees need. In your invites ask people if they have any needs. Also include any information about sensory experiences like loud music or flashing lights. If you are using Microsoft Outlook, you can run the accessibility checker on your final email.

> [!TIP]
> To run the accessibility checker in Microsoft Outlook, in the ribbon bar select **Review**, then select **Check Accessibility**.

Inclusivity isn't just about the people attending your invite. During the planning phase, try to look to bring in as wide a range of presenters and speakers as you can. Consolidate the presenter diversity in your event team, so that you can capture diverse perspectives there too.

Now that you've promoted your event and sent out invites, how are people going to register for the event? The platform you use for registration is a great place to capture accommodations. Consider asking if people need any of these:

- Captioned videos and live captioning of presentations
- Sign Language interpretation, ask if American Sign Language (ASL) or Universal Sign Language (USL) is proffered
- Other language interpretations
- Provide presentation materials before the event
- Large print or braille versions of handouts

Plan enough time for all your presenters, moderators, and producers to train on the tools they'll be using before the actual event. As you'll have a diverse event team, all your training materials need to be accessible. The training should also help presenters think about how their presentations can be made more accessible. For example, calling out important items on screen. All this training should culminate in one or more dress rehearsals. Each rehearsal allows the presenters to become comfortable with the tools. The producers to work out any technical issues, and the moderators refine the interactive experience they'd like for your attendees.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Giving everyone enough time to prepare and rehearse will help your event reduce the chance of issues, enable you to polish the content and it's delivery, and keep your event teams morale high and relaxed for success.


## Presentation accessibility

Presentations are at the heart of any event, in-person or virtual. So slide content and design needs to consider all these components.

### Contrast

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/contrast.png" alt-text="Example graphic showing contrast in an image. Black background with bright blue and white foreground text.":::

        </div>
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Use high contrast colors, the minimum contrast you should use is 4.5:1. But for your larger text as much as 3:1 is recommended. 

        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/contrast-text.png" alt-text="Example text on a background color. Three examples two that are good, black text on a white background and white text on a dark blue background. One bad example of white text on a light blue background." border="false":::

        </div>
        
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Shape and color

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Use different shapes when using colors when indicating statuses. This will help people with color blindness to understand the chart. 
        
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/shape-and-color.png" alt-text="Example graphic showing text and different colored shapes.":::

        </div>
    :::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

### Alternative text

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/alt-text.png" alt-text="Two example slides the top with a person and a company logo. The bottom slide shows an empty coffee shop.":::

        </div>

        To add alt text to object in Microsoft PowerPoint, right click then select **Edit Alt Text**. The pop out provides guidance, add one or two detailed sentences.
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Alt text helps people with screen readers to understand the images you use, and the content of your slides. Every image in your slide should have alt text, consider grouping individual shapes so that you can describe the slide as a whole. If an object has no meaning mark it as decorative.

        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/powerpoint-alt-text-popout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the alt text pop out in Microsoft PowerPoint.":::

        </div>
        
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Slide layouts

:::row:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Try to use the built-in slide layouts. This will help as it ensures a hierarchical reading of the text blocks. For example, if this is a title slide choose a built-in title layout rather than a blank side and adding a text box at the top. 

        This will also help when trying to create a good reading order.

    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/slide-layouts.png" alt-text="Example graphic showing two slides. The top a title slide, the second a content slide.":::

        </div>
    :::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

### Reading order

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/reading-order.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Microsoft PowerPoint showing a slide and the reading order below it.":::

        </div>


    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Screen readers are software that describe the content being shown on screen. This is normally in the order it is created. To check that your content is in the correct reading order, arrange your objects in the **Selection Pane** as appropriate.

        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/selection-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Selection Pane option.":::
