To prevent resources falling into the wrong hands, itâ€™s critical to ensure that your infrastructure is protected, and you have the appropriate security processes and technology in place. Enforcing a Zero Trust strategy strengthens the security posture of your resources. Some common ways you can harden or secure your infrastructure are:

- Implement threat detection systems
- Improve hardware configuration to plug gaps in your security perimeter
- Use just-in-time access control for access to virtual environments

### Implement threat detection systems

Threat detection tools, deeply integrated with Zero Trust strategy, are critical for workload protection. Threat detection systems enable organizations to identify and evaluate threats to infrastructure. Threat detection tools provide continuous monitoring, threat analysis, and even threat response against malicious attacks. They have predictive capability to identify emerging threats.

### Improve hardware configuration to plug gaps in your security perimeter

Cybersecurity begins with secure hardware configurations. The first step to monitor your hardware and related vulnerabilities is to disable default and unnecessary configurations. Continuous hardware assessment and configuration management implemented with Zero Trust principles provide strong defense against cyberattacks.

### Use just-in-time access control for access to virtual environments

The role of just-in-time (JIT) access solutions is to enforce the Zero Trust principle of least privilege access to users and devices. The core objective of JIT is that authorized users can access privileged accounts and resources only when they need them and for a specific timeframe. This means no standing access for any users in the organization. JIT access can be role-based, which is called **role-based access control (RBAC)**. JIT requires you to assign role-based permissions to give access to users. For example, with a JIT policy in place, administrative access will only be granted to the user who is being assigned the administrative role. Only when identity is verified through authentication and authorization will the user be given privileged access to resources.
