This module examines how to apply retention tags and Exchange Online retention policies to email messages and folders in Outlook and Outlook on the web. It also examines how to add other retention policies, and how to remove a policy.

In Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange Online, data governance helps organizations to manage email lifecycle and reduce legal risks associated with e-mail and other communications. Managing retention in email using retention tags and retention policies makes it easier to keep messages needed to follow company policy, government regulations, or legal needs, and to remove content that has no legal or business value.

> [!TIP]
> To proactively keep or delete mailbox content for information governance in Microsoft 365, it's recommended that you use retention policies and retention labels from the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center instead of messaging records management (MRM). However, if you've already implemented MRM, then you should continue using it to move messages to archive mailboxes.<br><br>If your organization currently uses messaging records management, this older feature will continue to work side by side with retention policies and retention labels. However, it's recommended that from this point on, you should use retention policies and retention labels instead. They'll provide your organization with a single mechanism to centrally manage both retention and deletion of content across Microsoft 365.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:<br>

 -  Determine when and how to use retention tags in mailboxes.
 -  Assign a retention policy to an email folder.
 -  Add optional retention policies to email messages and folders.
 -  Remove a retention policy from an email message.
