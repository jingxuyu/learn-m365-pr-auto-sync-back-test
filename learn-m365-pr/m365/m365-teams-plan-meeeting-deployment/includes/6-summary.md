As a Microsoft Teams administrator, you want to understand how to extend Microsoft Teams to support meetings and other features for your on-premises and work-from-home staff.

Teams is a powerful collaboration tool that can scale to meet your organization's needs. The need to organize meetings in any business is shifting towards virtual meetings, hosted in the cloud, that are accessible to your staff, whether they are in the office or working from home, and also with third-party vendors. Teams can scale to meet that need. However, it requires careful planning and consideration to ensure that it is deployed successfully.

In this module, you've explored the steps needed to plan the deployment of meetings features within Teams, including pre-requisites, network capabilities, the scope of meeting and conferencing to be offered, whether you'll offer meeting records, and what types of devices can be used.

Now that you've completed this module, you should be able to:

- Explain how to evaluate your organization's readiness to host cloud-based meetings through Teams
- Plan for the deployment of meetings using Teams
