To continue to meet legal, business, and regulatory compliance challenges, businesses must be able to keep and protect important information and quickly find whatâ€™s relevant. Keeping and protecting important information extends not just to how external entities view and use your data but also applies to how your employees use and access your organization's data. Microsoft 365 provides a number of tools, services, and features that can help enterprises mitigate or prevent insider risk.

Another aspect of the fast-changing regulatory requirements organizations must contend with is the ability to find relevant information. Manually sifting through millions of files to find the small number that are relevant is simply not an option. Whether responding to investigations, litigation, or regulatory requests, organizations must be able to quickly find what is relevant.  Advanced Audit and Advanced eDiscovery are tools to help your organization find relevant data quickly and cost effectively.

At the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explore the Microsoft 365 capabilities to manage insider risk
- Describe the tools available to help organizations find relevant data quickly and cost effectively
