  - content: "Lucerne Publishing uses both Conditional Access policies and device compliance policies. As the company's Enterprise Administrator, Patti Fernandez wants to create a compliance policy that determines how Intune treats devices that haven't been assigned a device compliance policy. What should Patti set the \"Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as\" setting to ensure that only devices that are confirmed as compliant can access the company's resources?"
    choices:
    - content: "Compliant"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't the correct value that Patti should select for the \"Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as\" setting."
    - content: "Not compliant"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If an organization uses Conditional Access with its device compliance policies, it's recommended that it change the \"Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as\" setting to Not compliant. Doing so ensures that only devices that are confirmed as compliant can access the company's resources."
    - content: "Disabled"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This value isn't one of the options for the \"Mark devices with no compliance policy assigned as\" setting."
  - content: "A conditional access policy can be created that includes many settings. Which of the following items is an Access Control setting that can be included in a conditional access policy?"
    choices:
    - content: "Persistent browser session"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. This access control setting allows users to remain signed in after closing and reopening their browser window."
    - content: "Users and groups"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't an access control setting. It's an assignment control setting that defines who the policy will include or exclude."
    - content: "Device state"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item isn't an access control setting. It's used to exclude devices that are hybrid Azure AD joined, or marked a compliant in Intune."
