You’ve successfully guided Woodgrove through the Prepare phase of the servicing process, and now they’re ready to move to Pilot deployment. As the process manager, you’re going to produce a high-level overview of the work that needs to be carried out before the update.

## Pilot deployment

For this phase of the servicing process, Woodgrove will carry out tasks to start Pilot deployment. Pilot deployment is the process of deploying an update to a select number of devices in production before being deployed broadly.

Pilot deployment involves many different tasks. At a higher level these tasks are:

- Assign pilot devices from the Prepare phase to receive the update
- Implement baseline updates
- Implement operations updates
- Validate the deployment process
- Deploy to devices
- Test and support devices
- Determine Broad deployment readiness

Woodgrove will assign tasks to the correct roles in the servicing process, and you will oversee the tasks and outcomes.

## Broad deployment 

When Pilot deployment has been completed, Woodgrove will launch Broad deployment of the update to devices across the wider production environment.

Woodgrove will decide on how to approach Broad deployment, including how devices will receive the update and the user experience.

Common tasks for Broad deployment include:

- Create Broad deployment ring
- Update bare metal process
- Assign devices
- Implement operations updates
- Validate deployment process
- Deploy feature update
- Support feature update
- Review deployment success
- Obtain recommendations for improvements

As with Pilot deployment, Woodgrove will assign tasks to the correct roles in the servicing process, and you will oversee the tasks and outcomes.

## Deployment considerations

Woodgrove will explore how to present the deployment of the update to users. For example, should the update be communicated to make users aware of it and any benefits provided? How will Woodgrove cater for users who have a business need that requires them to defer the update for a short period? 

It’s also important for Woodgrove to consider how the update is delivered to users. With the help of Configuration Manager, the company can make the update optional, and then enforce it later. By using Windows Update for Business, Woodgrove can set different deferrals. Windows Update for Business then determines when devices should update at a given time. Both tools provide options to configure the user experience when updates are applied, and are differentiated by the level of administrative effort to deploy the feature update. Windows Update for Business reduces administrative effort and relies on data driven insights to determine when a device is ready for deployment. Configuration Manager relies on an administrator to validate and deploy the update to devices. 

Woodgrove can create a communication strategy that informs users in a timely manner and motivates them to apply the update. For best results, the communication strategy for the update is tested with users in Pilot deployment, and then used for Broad deployment.
