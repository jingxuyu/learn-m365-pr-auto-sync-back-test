Moderators are key to helping ensure your live event is inclusive - they support presenters and attendees before, during, and after the event by following these best practices.

### Before

- Connect with the presenter(s) prior to the event or session and ask how they'd like to be introduced. For example, ask how they pronounce their name, what are their preferred pronouns, or whether they'd like you to reference their credentials.
- Ensure there is a slide showing the event and/or session name so attendees who join early know they're in the right place.
- Send a welcome message in chat and clearly state the starting time. For example, "Welcome to today's training session. We'll get started at 9 AM PT."

### During

- Explain event logistics. For example, is there a separate Q&A session, or are questions taken throughout?
- Keep a list of questions for the presenter and seed questions during Q&A if the audience is quiet.
- Repeat questions out loud during Q&A so that attendees can hear them and they can be captured for the recording.
- Towards the end, thank the attendees for joining and share the feedback survey link.
- At the end, thank the presenter and attendees, and share information about where recordings and materials will be available and encourage attendees to fill out the feedback survey posted in the chat

### After

- Share all the questions asked during the event with the presenter.
- Capture unanswered questions to include with post event communications or for the presenter to follow up on.
- Coordinate post-production of videos and presentation content with the event organizers to include in any attendee communications
