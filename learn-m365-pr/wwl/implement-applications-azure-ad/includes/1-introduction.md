As the Enterprise Administrator of your organizationâ€™s Microsoft 365 environment, you'll be responsible for implementing applications in Azure AD. In this module, you'll learn about various administrative tasks for implementing applications. These tasks include adding an application, updating an application, configuring multi-tenant applications, and removing an application.

Enterprise developers and software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers can develop commercial cloud services or line-of-business applications that can be integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). These applications can provide secure sign-in and authorization for their services. To integrate an application or service with Azure AD, a developer must first register the application with Azure AD. In this module, you'll learn how to register a new application using the Azure portal.

Once your application has been registered with Azure AD, it may need to be updated to provide access to web APIs. This process makes the app available in other organizations. You'll then learn about the various ways in which you can further configure your application. This examination focuses on the consent framework, which is important to understand when building applications that need to be used by other users or applications.

This module will then examine how to modify the configuration of a single-tenant application to make it a multi-tenant application. Single-tenant apps can only be accessed by users in your organization. Conversely, multi-tenant apps are accessible to users in external organizations.

The module concludes opposite from where it began. Once you've learned how to register an app in Azure AD, you'll then learn how to remove an application's registration from your Azure AD tenant.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Register an application or service within your Azure AD tenant
 -  Update an application within the Azure AD consent framework
 -  Modify the configuration of a single-tenant application to make it a multi-tenant application
 -  Remove an application's registration from your Azure AD tenant
