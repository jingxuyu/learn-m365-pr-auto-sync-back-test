# Introduction to Viva Connections
# Unit 1: Introduction
Successful organizations thrive on connection and engagement. In a world
where businesses are regularly switching to a hybrid work strategy,
keeping all employees in the loop with clear communication and relevant
information is more important than ever. Microsoft Viva Connections, a
Microsoft Teams app, is a personalized and interactive experience that
brings everything an employee needs to stay connected to their
organization into one central hub.
TIP_961

Viva Connections can be accessed:

-  By employees in the office, in the field, or at home.

-  Via desktop or mobile devices in the Microsoft Teams app.

Greater access to tasks, news, and resources allows everyone in the
organization to feel like they’re part of the greater whole. Viva
Connections seamlessly integrates with your organization's communities, and encourages employees to connect and elicits a feeling of
belonging—all while making it easier to accomplish high-impact tasks and
access popular resources.

Instead of spending time switching between different apps and interfaces
to access tasks and resources for daily job duties, Viva Connections
brings all these tools into one personalized destination—saving time,
boosting productivity, and connecting employees across the organization
in the process.

Viva Connections combines the power of your SharePoint intranet with
Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 apps. It has three main
components: Dashboard, Feed, and Resources.

-  With the **Dashboard**, employees have a centralized location where
they can interact with cards that help them access the most
important content and tools needed for their roles.

-  Each team member’s **Feed** is personalized to viewer and displays
dynamic content based on the SharePoint sites and Yammer communities
that they follow.

-  The **Resources** experience uses navigation elements from the
SharePoint app bar to make it easy to access popular portals and
tools from anywhere in Microsoft Teams.
# Unit 2: What do users experience?
Viva Connections optimizes communication and productivity by connecting
you with the right tools, people, and information for your job. Whether on desktop or mobile, Viva Connections brings together
relevant news, conversations, and resources into Microsoft Teams where
it’s easy to share, collaborate, and chat. Your Viva Connections experience includes three components: Dashboard, Feeds, and Resources. Now let’s take a look at each.

TIP_961

**Dashboard**

:::image type="content" source="../media/vc-dashboard-both.png" alt-text="Screenshots of Dashboard on both desktop and mobile phone.":::

[The Dashboard is a digital toolset that brings together tools and resources as Dashboard cards.](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview#viva-connections-dashboard)
The Dashboard enables you to create a curated experience using dynamic cards that give employees access to high-impact tools, news, and resources needed for their jobs. [Dashboard cards can be targeted to specific roles and regions](/viva/connections/use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections)
to make sure the tools are easy to identify, and resources are relevant
to the viewer.

**Feed**

:::image type="content" source="../media/vc-feed-both.png" alt-text="Screenshots of Feed on both desktop and mobile phone.":::

[The Feed](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview#viva-connections-feed)
displays organizational news and content from the SharePoint sites and
Yammer communities that the viewer follows. The Feed automatically
incorporates fresh and engaging content from across the organization to
keep users interested, while also ensuring that they see the most
important messages. Users will see content from SharePoint news posts,
Yammer community posts, and Stream videos in SharePoint. You can use the News boosts, audience targeting, and
Yammer's “Featured” options to [influence the content hierarchy in the](/viva/connections/faqs-viva-connections-feed#question-what-are-the-available-controls-to-influence-content-in-the-feed)
Feed, so your employees don’t miss important information.

**Resources**

:::image type="content" source="../media/vc-resources-both.png" alt-text="Screenshots of Resources on both desktop and mobile phone.":::

[Resources](/viva/connections/viva-connections-overview#viva-connections-resources)
are the navigational links that allow you to navigate to sites, news,
files, and more. Resources can be accessed as a tab in the mobile app
and by selecting the Viva Connections icon twice in the Microsoft Teams
app bar on desktop. You can set up and customize Resources in the
[SharePoint app
bar](/viva/connections/sharepoint-app-bar)
from your home site. Like the Dashboard and the Feed, [links can be
audience
targeted](/viva/connections/use-audience-targeting-in-viva-connections)
so the navigation is relevant to the user and their role.

**Desktop experience**

:::image type="content" source="../media/vc-desktop.jpg" alt-text="Screenshots of the desktop experience of Viva Connections.":::

TIP_893

On desktop, Viva Connections integrates your SharePoint [home site](/viva/connections/create-sharepoint-home-site-for-viva-connections)and [global navigation](/viva/connections/sharepoint-app-bar)
with Microsoft Teams. The desktop experience allows you to navigate to SharePoint sites, organizational news, and other content without leaving Teams. You can search and share intranet content in chats, teams, or channels, making collaboration easier than ever.

Add the [Dashboard](/viva/connections/use-dashboard-web-part-on-home-site) and [Feed](/viva/connections/use-feed-web-part-for-viva-connections) web parts to your SharePoint home site to complete the Viva Connections experience on the desktop app.

**Mobile view**

:::image type="content" source="../media/vc-three-components-mobile.png" alt-text="Screenshots of mobile experience of Viva Connections.":::

TIP_793

On mobile, the Viva Connections app is anchored around three key
concepts: Dashboard, Feed, and Resources. The mobile app displays the
Dashboard as the default tab in the Viva Connections app in the
Microsoft Teams app bar. Like the desktop experience, the mobile
experience allows you to navigate to SharePoint sites, organizational
news, and other important content without leaving Teams.

Viva Connections offers various extensibility solutions. To learn
about how the desktop experience and dashboard cards can be extended,

# Unit 3: When to use Viva Connections?
## Lamna Healthcare

:::image type="icon" source="../media/lamna-logo-white-bg-200.png":::

In this module, let us imagine a large chain of regional hospitals,
Lamna Healthcare that needs an employee experience tool for their
diverse types of employees. These employees include physicians and surgeons, nurse
practitioners, Human Resources professionals, IT professionals, office
administrators, custodial staff, and many more. View a simplified Lamna Healthcare
org chart below:

:::image type="content" source="../media/lamna-org-chart-white-bg.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a simplified Lamna Healthcare org structure.":::
Now, let’s review some scenarios Lamna Healthcare wants to support with
Viva Connections below.

### Viva Connections use cases in action

:::image type="icon" source="../media/story-telling-logo-white-bg.png":::

**Communicate and connect**

:::image type="content" source="../media/kendall.png" alt-text="Diagram showing profile of Kendall with head shot and job title.":::

Kendall is a nurse at Lamna Healthcare Region C hospital ER and needs to stay
updated on important workplace events, news, and team communication.
Kendall receives all organization-wide news and updates, such as the organization's updated vision and mission, the recorded CEO keynote speech to kickoff the new fiscal year, and upcoming events. As a medical professional, Kendall also receives news and updates on changes in medical products, procedures, policies and regulations through the Feeds feature. In addition, Kendall receives region-specific news for Region C because of his work location.

:::image type="content" source="../media/feed-scrolling-on-screen.gif" alt-text="Scrolling screenshot of Kendall viewing news feed on a mobile device." border="false":::

**Reminder:** Administrators for the Dashboard can target specific
content to different groups, so employees see the most important
organization news and access the resources they need most. This audience specific news might
include highlighting office updates for remote workers, any new
organization-wide rules and regulations for managers, and any updates on
critical policy updates for frontline workers like Kendall.

**Schedule and Task Management**

Kendall also needs to regularly access schedules, task lists, and
training materials. Through the Viva Connections Dashboard, Kendall has
direct access to the schedule and list of daily tasks. Lamna Healthcare
designed the view for the frontline workers’ Dashboard, so the most
important information and tools are right at the top. When starting
the day, Kendall clocks in through their mobile device by accessing Teams, then
selecting Viva Connections app, and then by selecting a card. Once Kendall
clocked in, he can navigate to a separate Dashboard card to view new
tasks added by the manager. Now, Kendall is ready to get to work!

**View** **pay and benefits**

:::image type="content" source="../media/jessie.png" alt-text="Diagram showing profile of Jessie with head shot and job title.":::

Jessie works in Lamna Healthcare’s Human Resources team as a Benefit
Specialist. Jessie answers repetitive questions from employees, employees, including where to find paystubs and how to request time off. Jessie collaborates with the Viva Connections administrator to make sure the Viva Connection’s Dashboard offers self-service cards so people in the rest of the organization can report time off and view their pay summaries. Then, Jessie has more time to assist employees with more complex benefit related questions.
To further customize employees’ experiences, Jessie works with the Viva Connections admins to add links to other SharePoint portals like Human Resources sites or content like frequently asked questions under the Resources tab, so that employees can easily access

:::image type="content" source="../media/lamna-resources.png" alt-text="Mobile screen of Lamna Healthcare Resources tab showing links to various Human Resources links." border="false":::

To further customize employees’ experiences, Dashboard admins can use
Viva Connections Resources to link to other SharePoint portals like
Human Resources sites or content like frequently asked questions.

**Training and onboarding**

:::image type="content" source="../media/amber.png" alt-text="Diagram showing profile of Amber with head shot and job title.":::

Amber is a leader at Lamna Healthcare and manages a team of eight employees.
As Lamna Healthcare has been rapidly growing its business in the past
two years, Amber's team has been growing and becoming more diverse. As a
manager, one of Amber's top objectives is setting up successful onboarding
and training processes for the new team members. With Viva Connections,
managers like Amber can work with the Dashboard administrator to set up
cards for new employees that include the onboarding tasks and training
in [Viva Learning](/viva/learning/) that
they need to complete. Integrations with another Viva module, [Viva
Insights](/viva/insights/), can help
create a well-rounded onboarding experience by helping team members
prioritize mental health, reserve time for focused work, and take
breaks.

Integrations with other [Microsoft Viva
modules](/viva/) like Viva Learning and
Viva Insights can help new and existing employees continue building skills through curated training and manage their work-life balance.

**Digitize processes**

In addition to onboarding and training, Amber spends numerous time managing tasks like approving time off requests, reimbursements, signing documents, and the team’s
projects. With Viva Connections, the Dashboard administrator works with
people managers to include cards and content targeted towards managers
that make it easy to access popular documents, training materials, and
other manager-specific tools.

# Unit 4: What technical requirements must be met to deploy Viva Connections?
Your organization must meet [certain technical requirements](/viva/connections/plan-viva-connections#step-1-meet-technical-requirements) before installing and setting up Viva Connections. More information on technical requirements will be reviewed in depth in [module 2](/training/modules/viva-connections-plan).

**Step 1 – Create a home site**: Create a SharePoint communication site
and [set it as a home site in the SharePoint admin center](/sharepoint/home-site). Home sites activate special features and provide a landing portal for the entire organization. [Learn more about how to plan, build, and launch a home site](/viva/connections/home-site-plan).
Once a home site has been created, you’ll be able to [create the Dashboard](/viva/connections/create-dashboard).

**Step 2 – Customize global navigation:** [Enable global navigation for the SharePoint application bar](/viva/connections/sharepoint-app-bar). This customizable feature allows users to find the information that’s most important to them such as news, sites, and files anywhere in SharePoint. Navigational links in global navigation get inherited by the Viva Connections Resource experience. Without setting up global navigation, there won't be any links in the Resources tab in the mobile app.

**Step 3 – Audit and modernize sites and content**: Ensure sites that will receive a high volume of traffic are [modernized](/sharepoint/dev/transform/modernize-classic-sites). For example, if you create cards on the Dashboard that link to HR (Human Resources) portals, you'll want to ensure the HR portal is modern and meets [healthy portal guidelines](/sharepoint/portal-health). Sites that haven't been modernized will open in a separate browser window instead of in Microsoft Teams.
