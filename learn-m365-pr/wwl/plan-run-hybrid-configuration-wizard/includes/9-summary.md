Planning a hybrid configuration is crucial to preventing issues during deployment. One of the key components in a hybrid configuration is the Hybrid Configuration Wizard (HCW).

This module examined all planning aspects that are required before running the HCW. Critical areas of concern that were covered in this module included:

 -  The configuration options of the HCW.
 -  The details on Organization Configuration Transfer (OCT).
 -  The purpose of the Hybrid Agent.

The module then reviewed the mail flow options for a hybrid deployment. Most organizations configure their hybrid deployment to share a common SMTP email namespace. You learned that this design requires routing messages in between your on-premises Exchange Servers and Exchange Online. As such, the module examined how to organize the email flow to and from the Internet, and between Exchange Online and the Exchange Server on-premises organization.

The module then reviewed why configuring a hybrid deployment is the first step for any Exchange organization. This step is completed whether you want to connect your Exchange on-premises and Exchange Online organizations for long-term coexistence, or as part of a cloud migration strategy.

The module concluded by examining the requirements and best practices to configure a hybrid deployment.
