If your organization is starting to use Teams alongside Skype for Business —or you're starting to upgrade to Teams—you should understand how the two applications coexist, and when and how they operate together.

Coexistence modes provide a predictable user experience as you move from Skype for Business to Teams. Depending on how you choose to deploy them, the chat, calling, and meeting capabilities in Teams may overlap with capabilities delivered by Skype for Business.

For an organization moving to Teams, the TeamsOnly mode is the final destination for each user. Until this time, you can use any coexistence mode, ensuring predictable communication between TeamsOnly and non-TeamsOnly users. When your users are in a coexistence mode, all incoming chats and calls are routed to the Skype for Business client and disabled in the Teams client. This avoids some user confusion.

Meeting scheduling in Teams is disabled when users are in certain coexistence modes. Scheduling is enabled in other modes. Because your user's presence indicator implies reachability through chat and calling, it doesn't display when chat and calling are disabled.

You can learn more about coexistence and interoperability in the module, **Understanding coexistence and interoperability.**
