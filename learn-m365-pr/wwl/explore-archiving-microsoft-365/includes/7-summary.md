This module explored how Microsoft 365 supports data governance. It examined the tools Microsoft 365 provides to import, store, preserve, retire, and expire data as it leaves an organization's data retention windows.

You learned that the compliance solution provided by Microsoft 365 is built upon three core pillars:

 -  Data governance
 -  eDiscovery
 -  Auditing

These three core features of Microsoft 365's compliance solution are built into the Security and Compliance Center (SCC). This secure, easy-to-use portal enables admins and security officers to go directly to the SCC and manage all that information across Microsoft 365 from one specific location.

The module then turned its focus towards in-place archiving of email messages in Exchange and records management of documents and libraries in SharePoint. Each product has become a reliable and common medium for communication and collaboration between information workers in organizations of all sizes. Mailboxes and document libraries have become repositories of valuable data.

You learned in this module that as a best practice, organizations should establish policies and provide guidelines to users about how to use messaging and document systems responsibly, including how data is stored. Organizations must also create policies to manage the life cycle of email and documents. This module examined how these policies may require system administrators to:

 -  Keep messages and documents for a length of time based on business, legal, and regulatory requirements.
 -  Preserve mailbox data and documents for litigation and investigation purposes.
 -  Prepare to search for and provide the required messaging and document records to fulfill eDiscovery requests.

In comparing the data governance solutions for Exchange and SharePoint, you were introduced you to In-Place Archiving in Exchange and Records Management in SharePoint. The module examined the differences between the two archiving tools. You also learned how documents are archived in SharePoint sites and OneDrive for Business locations. The module also explored the benefits of In-Place Records Management in SharePoint.
