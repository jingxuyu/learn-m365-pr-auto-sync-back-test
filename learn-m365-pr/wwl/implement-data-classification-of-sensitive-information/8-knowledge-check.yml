  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "How does document fingerprinting work?"
    choices:
    - content: "An organization's security department dusts documents for prints"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Just a suggestion, but maybe you need to revisit this unit in the training."
    - content: "A document's word patterns are converted into a document fingerprint"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The \"document fingerprinting\" name helps explain the feature. In the same way that a person's fingerprints have unique patterns, documents have unique word patterns. When an organization uploads a file, Microsoft Purview DLP identifies the unique word pattern in the document and creates a document fingerprint based on that pattern."
    - content: "The document fingerprint tool can be trained to recognize various types of content"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This item is the description of a trainable classifier tool."
  - content: "When a trainable classifier initially builds its model, what's the model based on?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft's pre-defined classification items"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft doesn't provide pre-defined classification items."
    - content: "What you seed it with"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. To create a trainable classifier, an organization must first present it with many samples of the type of content that are in the category. This feeding of samples to the trainable classifier is known as seeding. An organization must select the seed content that it wants to use to represent the category of content."
    - content: "Industry-standard classification items"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Trainable classifiers don't use industry-standard classification items, if there even is such a thing."
  - content: "Organizations can classify content using various methods in Microsoft 365. Which method recognizes an item because it's a variation on a template?"
    choices:
    - content: "Trainable classifiers"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Classifiers can be trained by giving them samples to look at."
    - content: "Manual classification"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Manual classification requires human judgment and action. Users and admins apply them to content as they encounter it."
    - content: "Document fingerprinting"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Document fingerprinting is a form of automated pattern-matching. It recognizes an item because it's a variation on a template."
