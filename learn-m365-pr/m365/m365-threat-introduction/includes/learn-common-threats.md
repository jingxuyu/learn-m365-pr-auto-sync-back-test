Users face multiple threats—from credential theft to malware to phishing to infrastructure attacks.

[Typical attack timeline](../media/typical-attack-timeline.png)

Targeted attacks usually follow a timeline similar to the above image with:

- Research on company (Using social media, open-source intelligence sources, data from previous attacks) and preparing for the attack.
- Elevation of privilege attack (typically using credential theft, but also abuse of administrative/management tools and configuration weaknesses).
- Attackers typically exfiltrate data for illicit purposes and go undetected for 200+ days. 

This is a general observation based on our incident response team’s experience, which is similar to what is reported by others in the industry. Precise numbers are difficult to produce because evidence of the initial “Patient 0” host is frequently lost after such a long period of time. 

Because most attacks are discovered by external parties, the variance in "time to discover" usually depends on the industry.  As an example, the retail industry usually discovers attacks more quickly as credit cards are put into the market, whereas the loss of other intellectual property such as technical designs takes longer to be apparent.
