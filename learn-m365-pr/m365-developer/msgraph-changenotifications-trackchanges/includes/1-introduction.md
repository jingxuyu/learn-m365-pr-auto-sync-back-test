Microsoft Graph enables developers to consume user information stored in Microsoft 365 in custom applications. Data is retrieved from Microsoft Graph through a REST API or using one of the various native SDKs provided by Microsoft.

In this module, you'll learn how to work with change notifications (webhooks) & track changes (delta query) in the Microsoft Graph.

## Prerequisites

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- Demonstrate how to use the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK
- Demonstrate how to subscribe and receive notifications when entities change with Microsoft Graph
- Demonstrate how to retrieve a list of all entities that have changed using delta query
