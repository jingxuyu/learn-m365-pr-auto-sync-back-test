Your teams could use many different tools when collaborating. Microsoft Teams can help your teams to use their existing tools more effectively.

## Microsoft Teams apps

Your organization can extend the capabilities of Microsoft Teams to help your teams improve the way they work. Microsoft Teams apps extend Microsoft Teams capabilities. A Microsoft Teams app is a package of services and can consist of messaging extensions, webhooks, bots, and tabs.

There are different ways for your organization to create Microsoft Teams apps. For example, your developers can use Node.js. to build bot-based apps. The preferred way is to use [App Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview) to easily build and integrate Microsoft Teams apps, whether these applications are custom apps or software-as-a-service applications that your organization already uses.

### Tabs for Microsoft Teams

Tabs are webpages that users can embed into Microsoft Teams, at either the scope of a Teams channel or at a personal user level. Users can create custom tabs to include web content to help add Microsoft Teams functionality to web pages.

Tabs can also be used to integrate Microsoft Teams with applications like Power BI. For example, users can use tabs to embed interactive Power BI reports in their Microsoft Teams channels and chats:

Tabs can also be used as support pages for messaging extensions and Microsoft Teams bots.

### Message extensions and bots

Message extensions enable your organization's users to interact with web services from Microsoft Teams. This makes it possible for users to trigger actions and execute queries in an external system, directly from Microsoft Teams. For example, a user can trigger a search command from the message box to look for low stock items in a sales inventory:

Your users can also take advantage of bots with Microsoft Teams. Bots allow your users to interact with other services in a sophisticated way by sending messages and receiving replies back from the bot. Bots can be used in a Teams channel or one-on-one conversations.

### Power Platform integration

If your teams are using Power Platform, Microsoft Teams can be integrated with Power Platform solutions to help your teams collaborate and get the best out of their solutions. There are different ways to do this, for example:

- **Power Virtual Agents**: Users can create chatbots using Power Virtual Agents without writing any code. Users can then integrate those bots into Microsoft Teams by publishing the bots and making them reachable to Microsoft Teams from the Power Virtual Agents portal.
- **PowerApps**: Users can create applications in PowerApps. Those applications can then be added directly to Microsoft Teams by creating tabs for those apps. Apps can be accessed from those tabs:<br />:::image type="content" source="../media/6-power-apps-tab.png" alt-text="Power Apps Integration":::

- **Power Automate**: Users can create flows to automate tasks in Power Automate. These can then be triggered from Microsoft Teams:<br />:::image type="content" source="../media/6-power-automate-flows.png" alt-text="Power Automate Flows":::

### Third-party apps and services

Your organization can integrate Microsoft Teams with third-party apps and services through webhooks and connectors. Webhooks and connectors help simplify how to connect web services to channels and teams inside Microsoft Teams.

#### Webhooks

Microsoft Teams enables your users with outgoing webhooks, incoming webhooks.

Outgoing webhooks enable your users to send text-based messages to your organization's web services. Your services can then respond with a message consisting of text or a card that includes text and image type content.

Incoming webhooks are also available. Incoming webhooks enable your external services to send messages to your Teams channels through an HTTP endpoint. This is useful for notification and tracking tools.

#### Connectors

Connectors are a way for your users to subscribe to receive alerts and information from your web services.

Users can find connectors by right-clicking on a team's channel and selecting **Connectors**. They can then add connectors from the list of connectors available to add to a channel:

In addition to Microsoft apps and services, users can find connectors for third-party apps like GitHub, Bitbucket, Salesforce, and many more.

Finally, users can use Office 365 Connectors. Office 365 Connectors enable users to make custom configuration pages for incoming webhooks and package them as part of a Microsoft Teams app. They can use this type of connector to work with other applications, like Outlook. Your organization can publish this type of connector internally, and also to Microsoft's App Store.
