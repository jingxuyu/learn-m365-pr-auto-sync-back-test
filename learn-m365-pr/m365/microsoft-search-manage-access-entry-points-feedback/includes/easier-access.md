To make finding work or school results easier, Microsoft Search supports some other entry points.

## Microsoft Edge address bar shortcut

When searching from the Microsoft Edge address bar, two shortcuts—'work' and your organization's preferred or shortened name—narrow results to only show work. For information about adding custom keywords, see [Customize address bar shortcuts for Microsoft Edge](/microsoftsearch/edge-shortcuts).

## Embedded search boxes

To provide access to work or school results from your intranet or internal apps, embed a Microsoft Search in Bing search box.

Benefits of using an embedded search box:

- A search box on your classic SharePoint or intranet portal provides a familiar, trusted entry point to start searching. (Modern SharePoint users can access work search in the app header.)
- Supports all major web browsers, including Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome.
- Only search suggestions from your organization appear; web suggestions are never included.
- Takes users to a Microsoft Search in Bing work results page, which excludes ads and web results.
- You control the appearance and behavior of the search box, including the ability to land users on a specific vertical.

For more information, see [Add a search box to your intranet site](/microsoftsearch/add-a-search-box-to-your-intranet-site).

## Microsoft Search extension

If your organization uses Google Chrome, the [Microsoft Search extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-search/fahnnnailfccbjpdjeafekniiaflekca) can help these users find work results. A Bing work results page always appears for searches made from the extension. Here’s what the extension looks like for signed out and signed in users.

For information about using group policy to deploy the extension, see [Set Chrome app and extension policies (Windows)](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7532015) on the Chrome Enterprise and Education Help site.
