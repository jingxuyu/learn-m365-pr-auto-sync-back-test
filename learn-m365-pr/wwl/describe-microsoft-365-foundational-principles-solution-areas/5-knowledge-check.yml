    - content: "It reduces the need for data protection."

    - content: "Control."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Putting people in control of their own privacy settings is one of Microsoft’s six primary privacy principles."
  - content: "What does Microsoft’s Discover & Respond solution do?"

  - content: "What is identity management?"
    choices:
    - content: "The process of identifying a user."

    - content: "A type of user account."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Users are identified through their user accounts, but there is more to identity management than creating a user account, including validating that the user account has not been compromised."
