  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Contoso and Fabrikam each have an Exchange Server 2019 deployment. As the Messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to configure federated sharing between the two organizations. However, Holly wants to control the federated sharing by limiting it to specific users. How can Holly implement this level of federated sharing?"
    choices:
    - content: "By creating an organization relationship with Fabrikam"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Sharing policies are automatically available for everybody in an external organization when you configure organization relationships. Try again."
    - content: "By creating sharing policies within Exchange that are assigned to selected users"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A sharing policy that you create in Exchange can be assigned to specific users. This design enables you to ensure that sharing policies can be granular and not automatically available for everybody in an external organization as when you configure organization relationships."
    - content: "By using the default sharing policy within Exchange"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The default sharing policy in Exchange applies to all users. Try again."
  - content: "Contoso and Fabrikam each have an Exchange Server 2019 deployment. As the new Messaging administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson wants to configure federated sharing between the two organizations. While verifying which Azure AD authentication system instance each Exchange organization uses, Holly discovered that a federation trust already exists between the two organizations. Given this situation, what does Holly need to do to implement federated sharing with Fabrikam?"
    choices:
    - content: "Run the Federation Trust wizard to generate a new self-signed certificate"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't required to implement federated sharing with Fabrikam. Try again."
    - content: "Change the existing federated trust relationship to reflect each organization's current domain infrastructure"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't required to implement federated sharing with Fabrikam. Try again."
    - content: "Configure an organization relationship"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. If a federation trust to the Azure AD authentication system already exists for both Exchange organizations, you donâ€™t need to change the federation trust. Instead, you just have to configure an organization relationship or sharing policy."
  - content: "Organizations that implement federated sharing must first configure a federation trust with what object?"
    choices:
    - content: "The Microsoft Azure AD authentication system"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Federation refers to the underlying trust infrastructure that supports federated sharing. When you configure federation, you configure a federated trust with the Microsoft Azure AD authentication system."
    - content: "The organization that you want to establish a federated trust with"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This item isn't who you configure a federated trust with. Try again."
    - content: "Exchange Online or Exchange Server 2010 or higher"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The organizations that want to enable collaboration with one another must have either of these Exchange environments. You do not establish federated trusts with these Exchange environments. Try again."
