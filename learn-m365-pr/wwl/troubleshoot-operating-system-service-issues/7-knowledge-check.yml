  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Desktop Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson is auditing information on a Windows 10 computer that's been experiencing issues as of late. Holly wants to review information such as valid and invalid sign-in attempts, and events related to resource use such as creating, opening, or deleting files. Which log file should Holly review in the Event Viewer?"
    choices:
    - content: "Application log"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The application log contains events that applications generate. For example, a database program records a file error in the application log, and the program developer decides which events to record. Try again."
    - content: "Security log"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The security log records security events, such as valid and invalid sign-in attempts, and events related to resource use such as creating, opening, or deleting files. An administrator specifies which events Windows records in the security log by creating a domain-wide audit policy."
    - content: "System log"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The system log contains events that the system components in Windows generate. For example, if a driver or other system component fails to load during startup, Windows records this failure in the system log. Windows predetermines the event types that the system components log. Try again."
  - content: "Your Windows 10 computer has been experiencing start up problems due to some type of service issue. What can you do to only load a minimal set of services during the startup process so that you can troubleshoot the service startup issue?"
    choices:
    - content: "Start the computer in safe mode"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. If the Windows computer doesn't start normally, try to start the computer in safe mode. You can access the Safe Mode option from the Advanced Boot Options menu, but you also can activate safe mode from MSConfig.exe. In safe mode, a minimal set of services load during the startup process. However, these services are sufficient to load the operating system. You then can troubleshoot the service startup problem using standard Windows operating system tools."
    - content: "Modify the MSConfig.exe file, activate boot logging, and then examine the generated log file"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this step can be used to troubleshoot system and service issues, it doesn't load a minimal set of services during the startup process. Try again."
    - content: "Configure Windows to record a Ntbtlog.txt file when it starts"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this step can be used to troubleshoot system and service issues, it doesn't load a minimal set of services during the startup process. Try again."
  - content: "Miranda is a Sales manager at World Wide Importers. Miranda is able to sign in, but can't access network resources. As the company's IT Support professional, you suspect that this may be due to the sign-in process using Miranda's cached credentials. You've verified that Miranda's computer has network connectivity and that the computer account is authenticating properly. What can you try next to help limit your troubleshooting scope?"
    choices:
    - content: "Have Miranda sign-in to a second computer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When a user can sign in but can't access network resources, the sign-in process may be using the userâ€™s cached credentials. If this happens, you should verify that the computer has network connectivity and the computer account is authenticating properly. If your organization does not restrict user sign-in to specific computers, the user can attempt to sign in to a second computer, which identifies whether the authentication issue pertains to a specific computer. You can use the results of this test to limit your troubleshooting scope. For example, if the issue isn't computer-specific, then it isn't a local computer-configuration issue."
    - content: "Use Windows PowerShell to query Miranda's account status"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this action is a sign-in troubleshooting step, there's a better option that will help limit your troubleshooting scope. Try again."
    - content: "Use Event Viewer to view event logs"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this action is a sign-in troubleshooting step, there's a better option that will help limit your troubleshooting scope. Try again."
  - content: "Fabrikam's help desk staff has been conducting a high number of account resets due to users forgetting their new passwords and ultimately being locked out of their accounts. What's the probable cause of this situation?"
    choices:
    - content: "User's failure to write down their new passwords on sticky notes"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this action can help solve the issue, it's not a recommended step for obvious security reasons. Try again."
    - content: "The company's account lockout threshold is set too low"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Setting the account lockout threshold too low can create excessive administrative burden, as the help-desk staff will be conducting many account resets. Remember that many users will forget that they changed their password recently, and might require a few attempts to sign in before they remember."
    - content: "Persistent drive mappings are used"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. While this issue can result in account lockout, it's not the typical issue that causes users to be locked out of their accounts. Try again."
  - content: "When you attempted to sign in to one of your company's older Windows 10 computers, you received an error message indicating that a service failed to start. As you begin troubleshooting the problem, what should you pay special attention to?"
    choices:
    - content: "The lis of services in the System Configuration tool"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The System Configuration tool is used to specify which services you want to run on startup. Try again."
    - content: "The stop code that's displayed"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The stop code is only displayed on a blue screen. Try again."
    - content: "Error events recorded in the system log records"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. When you troubleshoot startup problems with services, pay special attention to error events that the system log records."
