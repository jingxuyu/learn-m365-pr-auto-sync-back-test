## Explorer

**Explorer** is the main reporting feature in Viva Goals and is available to all users. You can use it to find OKRs that meet a certain set of criteria.

Explorer takes all the current OKR data within the system and applies filters to it to create reports, known as **Views**. These Views can then be saved and returned to in the future. You can also export the data from a particular View.

To use Explorer:

1. Select the **Explorer** tab in the Navigation Sidebar.
    1. This will display saved reports created by you or shared with you by your colleagues.
1. Select a **View** to run the report.
1. To create a new report, select **Create new view**.

The **New View** area will start to display all the OKR data in Viva Goals. To begin customizing this view, perform the following:

1. Select **+ Add filter**.
1. Select the relevant data point(s) then follow the steps required to choose your parameters.
    1. You can carry on adding filters until you have the View that meets your needs.
1. When you're ready to save, select **Save View**.
1. Enter a name for the View in the **View name** field.
1. Set your privacy settings.
    1. If you want your View to be available to everyone in your organization, select **Public**.
    1. To keep your view private, select **Private**.
1. Select **Save**.

To export the data from your view:

1. Select the **Actions** dropdown menu.
1. Select **Export**.
1. Select whether you wish to receive a **csv** or **xlxs** file.
1. Select the **fields** that you wish to be included in the report and any **Additional options**.
1. Select **Export**.

You'll receive an email with the data.

As an example, imagine you wanted to create a view showing all OKR data that hasn't been updated for two weeks.

1. Select "Create New View" from the navigation side bar.
1. Select **+ Add filter**.
1. Select **Last Check-in** from the dropdown menu.
1. Select the **More than** tick box.
1. Enter **14** into the **days** textbox.
1. Select another point on the screen to close the dropdown menu.

The screen will now be displaying OKRs that haven't been updated for more than two weeks.

### Review Dashboard

**The Review Dashboard** allows you to display and present OKR data in a customizable way. Review dashboards can be created at all levels to help with the different types of communication that occur within an organization:

- **Organization**: All-hands meetings and Quarterly Business Reviews
- **Team**: Standups and Bi-weekly progress updates
- **Individual**: One on Ones

You can create a number of **Panels** within the Review Dashboard. Panels can be designed to focus on a particular subject or area of interest. To these you can add **Widgets** that will display a set of data you've selected. The data displayed in Review Dashboards isn't exportable.

Your colleagues can at any time review the data displayed in the Review Dashboard, fostering collaboration, and allowing you to identify potential bottlenecks or areas of duplication.

You can also use the **Present** mode to effectively present real-time data updates during meetings and presentations.

Review Dashboards can be found under the **Dashboards** tab. To create a new Review Dashboard:

1. Select **New Dashboard** from the **Dashboard** dropdown menu.
1. Enter the name of the Dashboard in the top text box and select **Save**.

The first Panel will be displayed below. Enter the name of this Panel into the text and select **Save**. Once saved, a list of Widgets will populate in the newly named panel.

The Widgets available are:

- **OKR Detail** - Focus on OKR trends, recent updates and status over time.
- **Custom Embed** - Embed a URL in the context of OKRs.
- **Text Block** - Add rich text, images to add additional context to the data.
- **KPI List** - Highlight key metrics at the current point in time or across quarter.
- **OKR LIST** - Summarized report on the list of OKRs over time.
- **Image** - Embed an image in the context of OKRs.
- **Project List** - Track status updates of multiple projects in one place.

Selecting the relevant widget button will take you through the steps needed to set up the Widget, and the data you wish to display.

For more information about how each Widget operates, refer to our **Components of a Dashboard** article LINK TO ARTICLE IN DOCS current URL <https://help.ally.io/articles/4362733-components-of-a-dashboard#h_fd582b99eb>

You can add any number of Widgets to a Panel.

1. When you're ready to create a new Panel, select **Save** to save the current one.
1. Then select **+ Add another panel to the dashboard** and begin adding Widgets.
1. If at any point you wish to change a Panel you've created, select the **More actions** button on the Panel.

When your **Review Dashboard** is complete, you can choose to make the Dashboard only viewable by you, viewable by a particular group of users, or available to all your colleagues in the organization.

1. Select either the **Padlock** icon or **Share**.
    1. The **Share Dashboard** menu will be displayed.
1. Use the dropdown menu to select either ***Organization* - View Access** or **Private**.
1. The **Search for a user** box can be used to make the Dashboard available to particular users.
1. Select **Save** once the necessary permissions have been chosen.

Those that are allowed to see the Dashboard can now navigate to it and view the data. The Dashboard is interactive, so selecting elements within a Widget, such as an Objective, will display more data.

When you need to present the data from your **Review Dashboard** in a meeting, select **Present**. This will display each panel as a single page. You can move through the pages by using the navigation controls. The **Present** mode is still interactive so you can select elements within each widget, such as an Objective, and more data will be displayed.

If you need to clone a Dashboard or clone a Dashboard and move it to another individual or entity, select the **More actions** menu. Select **Clone** or **Clone and Move** as required.

The **More actions** menu is also where you can choose to **Delete** and **Rename** your Dashboard.

You can also choose **Select as default** which will set your current Dashboard as the default displayed when you first navigate to the **Dashboards** tab.
