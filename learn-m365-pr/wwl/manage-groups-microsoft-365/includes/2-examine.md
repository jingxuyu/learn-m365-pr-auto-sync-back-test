Groups can be used to manage sets of users at the same time. For example, if a team is assigned to a group, the group can be used to apply permissions on a SharePoint team site. The group can also be used to distribute messages to everyone who's a member of the group. The following table provides an overview of all group types, and where they can be created in Microsoft 365.

This is the recommended group type. It is similar to distribution groups in that it has its own mailbox and its members receive email messages that are sent to the group. However, it differs from distribution groups in that it allows teams to collaborate by providing them a shared workspace for email, conversations, files, and calendar events.
