**Office 365 Connectors** are a great way to push the rich content of other services into Microsoft Teams. Any user can connect a team to services like Twitter, RSS feeds, Trello, Wunderlist, GitHub, Azure DevOps Services, or Bing News and receive updates of the team's activity in that service.

## What are connectors?

A connector connects content and updates from external services directly into a Teams channel or chat.

Any member of a team can use connectors if the team permissions allow, and information posted by these connectors can be viewed in all clients including mobile. You can even add actions to the connector content, turning them into *actionable messages*, so that users can complete tasks directly in the channel.

Office 365 connectors can be used with both Microsoft Teams and Office 365 Groups. Both Microsoft Teams and Exchange use the same connector model, which allows you to use the same connectors within both platforms. The connector pictured here is displaying updates from Office 365 within Teams.

Itâ€™s also easy to develop custom connectors that can integrate with your business applications.
