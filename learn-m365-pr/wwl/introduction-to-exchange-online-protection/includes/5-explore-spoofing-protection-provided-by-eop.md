As previously discussed, spoofing is controlled by the built-in protection provided by EOP and by implementing authentication techniques such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. For customers who have purchased Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 licenses, the Spoof Intelligence feature in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center (SCC) can provide insight into senders who are spoofing your domain. Spoof Intelligence enables an organization to review senders who are spoofing its domain. They can then choose to either allow the sender to continue or to block the sender.

The Spoof Intelligence feature is enabled through a Spoof Intelligence policy that's automatically created, enabled by default, and enforced by Microsoft 365. While this default policy can't be disabled, it can be managed. An organization can control which domain or user can spoof its domain by reviewing the existing policy applied in the SCC.

The following screenshot from the Security and Compliance Center displays a list of senders that may be spoofing an organization.
