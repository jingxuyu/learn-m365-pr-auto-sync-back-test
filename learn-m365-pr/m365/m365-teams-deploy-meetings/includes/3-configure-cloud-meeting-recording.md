Recording a meeting is often useful for, as an example, keeping a legal record of what was said or  enabling absentees to review a meeting later.

In your software development company, it's your policy to record every meeting with a customer to ensure there's a record of what is said. You want to ensure that this requirement is met as you move to Microsoft Teams from your third-party conferencing solution.

Here, you'll learn how to administer Teams meeting recordings.

## Compliance and e-discovery for meeting recordings

The meeting recordings are stored in Microsoft Stream, which is Microsoft 365 and Office 365 Tier-C compliant. To support e-discovery requests for compliance admins who are interested in meeting or call recordings for Microsoft Streams, the "recording completed" message is available in the compliance content search functionality for Microsoft Teams. Compliance admins can look for the keyword "recording" in the subject line of the item in compliance content search preview and discover meeting and call recordings in the organization. A prerequisite for them to view all recordings is that they'll need to be set up in Microsoft Stream with admin access.
