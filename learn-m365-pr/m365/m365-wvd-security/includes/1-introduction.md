Imagine that you work for a growing financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. The company uses Microsoft 365 and a Windows Server Active Directory (AD) that’s in sync with Microsoft Azure AD and configured using Azure AD Connect. 

The IT director has asked you, their lead system engineer and Azure administrator, to evaluate the risks and benefits to using Windows Virtual Desktop to support their remote workers. The key aspects of the evaluation will be functionality, scalability, security, and cost of WVD.

After completing this module, you’ll be able to explain the responsibilities of a WVD deployment and assess its security.
