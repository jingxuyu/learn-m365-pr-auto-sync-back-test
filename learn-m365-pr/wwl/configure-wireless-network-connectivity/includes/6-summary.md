This module explores wireless networking technologies. Wireless standards continue to evolve, and new standards are frequent. In order for a device to connect to the wireless network, both the device and the network infrastructure must support the same standard. Most wireless networks use some form of encryption, and devices and infrastructure must also match to facilitate communication. Windows clients can also use wireless technologies such as Miracast and NFC to communicate with other devices such as a remote display.
