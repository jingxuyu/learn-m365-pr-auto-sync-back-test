Zero Trust embodies the principles of verify explicitly, apply least privileged access, and always assume breach. In our Zero Trust journey, we’re now looking at infrastructure.

Infrastructure, like air, is all around us. However, for the most part, none of us think about it too much. It just exists. For your organization, IT infrastructure touches and binds together several aspects of the Zero Trust model. Whether you use the cloud or on-premises servers, all IT infrastructure covers the hardware, software, networking, and facilities needed to make an organization operate. Because of its broad coverage, IT infrastructure tends to be targeted more often by cybercriminals.

The Zero Trust framework helps you to address the security threats to your infrastructure by using monitoring and control to spot vulnerabilities and weaknesses. By applying Zero Trust principles to configuration management, you ensure every element of your infrastructure is kept up-to-date with the latest patches and upgrades. Applying Zero Trust principles for your infrastructure will enable your organization to meet security and compliance obligations.

Here, you’ll learn what is meant by the term infrastructure, and why it's a critical threat vector. You’ll understand how configuration management can ensure every device and endpoint is operating at optimal performance, and how to limit access to critical services through just-in-time policies.
