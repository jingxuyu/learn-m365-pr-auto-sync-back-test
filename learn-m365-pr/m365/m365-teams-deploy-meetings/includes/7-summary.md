In your software development company, audio and video conferencing had been delivered by third-party solutions. Having rolled out Microsoft Teams, you wanted to standardize on Teams meetings for audio and video conferencing, and integrate it with file management, chat, and other Teams features.

Many companies conferencing solutions have historically been stand-alone. By moving to Microsoft Teams, you can achieve a much closer integration between conferencing and other teamwork activities.

- Explain how to set up users for Teams meetings.
- Describe how to configure cloud meeting recording.
- Demonstrate how to set up shared meeting rooms.
- Explain how to deploy Cloud Video Interoperability.
