Outlook users can't create new retention policies. Instead, they must be created by a Microsoft 365 administrator with the appropriate permissions.

Organizations can provide optional retention policies that don't appear by default. If other retention policies are available, a user can complete the following steps to add them to the available choices that are displayed when applying policies:

1.  In the message list, select a message. To select more than one message, press and hold the CTRL key as you select each message.
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Tags** group, select **AssignPolicy**.<br><br>:::image type="content" source="../media/outlook-retention-policies-menu-8ce3cb6e.png" alt-text="screenshot of the Retention policies menu in the Tags group in the Outlook ribbon, with the Assign Policy option selected":::
    
3.  Under **Retention Policy**, select **More Retention Policies**.
4.  In the **Retention Policies** dialog box, select **Add or Remove Retention Policies**. Outlook on the web opens in a web browser window.
5.  In Outlook on the web, enter your credentials to sign in if prompted. Outlook on the web opens to the **Retention Policies** section under **Mail options**.
6.  In the list, select a policy and then select **Add**.

The optional policy is added to the list of policies that you can select when specifying a retention policy on a folder or item.
