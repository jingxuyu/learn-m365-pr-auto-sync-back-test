Employee engagement is creating a culture where people care about the organization they work for. This is important because people who care do more than simply get their work done, they work to achieve the organization's goals. People who are engaged are more likely to enjoy their work and are less likely to switch jobs. Microsoft's research suggests three major areas to consider.
