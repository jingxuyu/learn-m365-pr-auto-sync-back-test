## Phased deployments
In addition to providing proactive end user communications, you might also consider using deployment rings to control the rate of release within your organization. Phased deployment using deployment rings is the concept of starting with small groups and then broadening the deployment scale in a measured way over time. As your organization begins preparing a communication and training plan, these rings should be formed and accounted for in the plan. This way you can reduce potential risk and validate your approach as you open the deployment valve or pause activities as needed, if for example, you see more helpdesk calls than expected. Deployment rings are best created in cooperation with business units and their managers. With careful planning and buy-in from stakeholders, it will be easier to get users on-board and comfortable with any changes coming their way.

**Phase 1: The IT team and early adopters.** We recommend beginning deployment with the IT team and enthusiastic early adopters who volunteer for early access. With these “insiders,” you can test communications, impacts of the change, and the effectiveness of your training. During this phase, IT runs small pilots to develop troubleshooting and automation techniques to use during broader deployment phases.

It’s important to have engaged members in the initial pilot phase to ensure they are documenting their observations and providing feedback to the deployment team. Also, it’s a good idea to have champions outside the IT team that help spread word-of-mouth communications on new capabilities as they’ll often be first line of support when users in later phases need help. Business unit champions are great early adopters as they can help test the newest functionalities, provide feedback on communications and training, and drive adoption within their broader business units.

**Phase 2: Pilot.** Once phase one has been established, you can target a larger set of users for the second pilot phase. This should comprise a representative mix of user roles, device types, Windows apps, and Office add-ins. The analytics data returned from these groups should then be used to target the broader deployment. Remember that all PCs in this and future phases should be logging into the analytics service so you can collect data about device and app health as well as bandwidth savings from Delivery Optimization and use of Windows Hello login.

For this phase, it is especially important to continue to communicate changes and help users take advantage of new capabilities. Users can often de-prioritize or ignore email or other communications coming from IT – so it helps to meet with management to get their help in communicating the changes and drive adoption. End user input is also needed on timeframes to avoid so IT can minimize user disruption. For example, the finance team may be particularly sensitive at the end of fiscal quarters or product development teams during a product launch.

**Phase 3: Broad production deployment.** By the time broad deployment begins, the processes, communications, training, and self-service tools should be refined and in place. Deploy at a rate that is manageable to the IT department, helpdesk, end users, and network capacity. You can always go back to prior deployment steps to further optimize the network by using peer-to-peer cache, LEDBAT, and other techniques to facilitate faster transfer of deployment-related data.

In addition to the diagnostic data monitored via the analytics tools, you can also monitor Office 365 and Microsoft 365 service usage by workload with detailed usage reports in the admin center and the admin dashboards via Power BI. These are great tools to help set and track goals and ensurenew collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and OneDrive are rolled out throughout the organization.

New technology acceptance and adoption will go on long after every user in your organization has installed Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus. End users won’t necessarily change how they work if the business doesn’t take the time to train and inform them of the new functionality. With new servicing models providing new capabilities semi-annually for Windows and optionally monthly for Office, communication will be an ongoing process.
