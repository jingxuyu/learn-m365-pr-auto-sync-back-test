Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps provides insight into suspicious activity in Microsoft 365. This information gives organizations enhanced visibility and control over your Microsoft 365 tenant.

Defender for Cloud Apps consists of three core areas:

 *  **Threat detection.** Defender for Cloud Apps enables organizations to identify high-risk and abnormal usage, security incidents, and potential threats in their environment. For example, if you have an administrator who is doing something that admins normally don't do – such as forwarding mail to different people – Defender for Cloud Apps alerts you so that you can investigate those actions.
 *  **Enhanced control.** Defender for Cloud Apps lets organizations monitor activities by providing granular controls and policies. For example, if someone completes a mass download of information, you can be alerted to it so that you can take appropriate action.
 *  **Discovery and insights.** Defender for Cloud Apps provides insight into the variety of cloud apps people in your organization are using. This insight enables you to see which apps are being used and whether they’re approved for use in your organization.

Moving to the cloud increases flexibility for employees and IT alike. However, it also introduces new challenges and complexities for keeping your organization secure. To get the full benefit of cloud apps and services, an IT team must find the right balance of supporting access while maintaining control to protect critical data.

Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps supports various deployment modes including log collection, API connectors, and reverse proxy. It provides rich visibility, control over data travel, and sophisticated analytics to identify and combat cyberthreats across all your Microsoft and third-party cloud services. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps natively integrates with leading Microsoft solutions and is designed with security professionals in mind.

### The Defender for Cloud Apps framework 

Defender for Cloud Apps provides the following functionality:

 *  **Discover and control the use of Shadow IT**. Identify the cloud apps, IaaS, and PaaS services used by your organization. Investigate usage patterns, assess the risk levels and business readiness of more than 16,000 SaaS apps against more than 80 risks. Start managing them to ensure security and compliance.
 *  **Protect your sensitive information anywhere in the cloud**. Understand, classify, and protect the exposure of sensitive information at rest. Use out-of-the box policies and automated processes to apply controls in real time across all your cloud apps.
 *  **Protect against cyberthreats and anomalies**. Detect unusual behavior across cloud apps to identify ransomware, compromised users or rogue applications, analyze high-risk usage and remediate automatically to limit the risk to your organization.
 *  **Assess the compliance of your cloud apps**. Assess if your cloud apps meet relevant compliance requirements including regulatory compliance and industry standards. Prevent data leaks to non-compliant apps, and limit access to regulated data.

Defender for Cloud Apps integrates visibility with your cloud by:


 *  Using Cloud Discovery to map and identify your cloud environment and the cloud apps your organization is using.
 *  Sanctioning and unsanctioning apps in your cloud.
 *  Using easy-to-deploy app connectors that take advantage of provider APIs, for visibility and governance of apps that you connect to.
 *  Using Conditional Access App Control protection to get real-time visibility and control over access and activities within your cloud apps.
 *  Helping you have continuous control by setting, and then continually fine-tuning, policies.
