Successful organizations thrive on connection and engagement. In a world
where businesses are regularly switching to a hybrid work strategy,
keeping all employees in the loop with clear communication and relevant
information is more important than ever. Microsoft Viva Connections, a
Microsoft Teams app, is a personalized and interactive experience that
brings everything an employee needs to stay connected to their
organization into one central hub.

It can be accessed:

-   By employees in the office, in the field, or at home.

-   Via desktop or mobile devices in the Microsoft Teams app.

Greater access to tasks, news, and resources allows everyone in the
organization to feel like they’re part of the greater whole. By
seamlessly integrating with your organization’s communities, Viva
Connections encourages employees to connect and elicits a feeling of
belonging—all while making it easier to accomplish high-impact tasks and
access popular resources.

Instead of spending time switching between different apps and interfaces
to access tasks and resources for daily job duties, Viva Connections
brings all these tools into one personalized destination—saving time,
boosting productivity, and connecting employees across the organization
in the process.

Viva Connections combines the power of your SharePoint intranet with
Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 apps. It has three main
components: Dashboard, Feed, and Resources.

-   With the **Dashboard**, employees have a centralized location where
    they can interact with cards that help them access the most
    important content and tools needed for their roles.

-   Each team member’s **Feed** is personalized to viewer and displays
    dynamic content based on the SharePoint sites and Yammer communities
    that they follow.

-   The **Resources** experience uses navigation elements from the
    SharePoint app bar to make it easy to access popular portals and
    tools from anywhere in Microsoft Teams.
