Managing your security posture to protect against a continually evolving threat landscape offers many challenges. From having too many security solutions with various places to configure lots of controls, a lack of knowledge around which controls are the most effective, and being unable to benchmark yourself against other organizations, it can be difficult for security teams to find the right balance of security and productivity.

Microsoft Secure Score helps you understand your security position, giving you advice on what controls you should consider enabling, and helping you understand how your score compares to other organizations.

Microsoft Secure Score includes Office 365 security recommendations, along with recommendations from Azure Active Directory, Azure Security Center, Windows Defender ATP, Intune, and Cloud App Security. This provides you an easy way to find and control your security settings across different groups. You can also use Microsoft secure score to report to your team about the organizationâ€™s overall security health. h. 

Secure score recommendations are organized into the following categories:
1.	Identity
2.	Data
3.	Devices
4.	Apps
5.	Infrastructure (coming soon)

You can use Microsoft Secure Score recommendations to target the most important settings and make changes quickly.
