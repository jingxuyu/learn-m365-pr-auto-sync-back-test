To help monitor and manage device configuration profiles, the Endpoint Manager admin center includes features to check the status of a profile, see which devices are assigned to it, and update the properties of a profile. The Sync device action can be used to force an immediate check-in within Intune to pull down the latest policies and actions applied to a device. Otherwise, Intune check-ins will follow their default synchronization frequency according to the device platform. PowerShell scripts can be run using the Intune management extension that can provide further capabilities needed, such as installing legacy Win32 applications on Windows devices.
