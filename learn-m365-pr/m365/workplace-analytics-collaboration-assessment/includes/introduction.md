The Workplace Analytics Collaboration assessment dashboard uses a Power Business Intelligence (BI) template that’s populated with Workplace Analytics data. You use this behavioral data to gain insights into how employees collaborate in an organization. This dashboard directionally highlights collaboration patterns for different levels and groups, offering a starting point for identifying opportunities to streamline collaboration and improve the employee experience.

Imagine you are an HR people analytics manager. Your Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) is overseeing some initiatives designed to streamline ways of working, reduce burnout risk and boost manager effectiveness. The initiatives will require continuously piloting interventions, measuring their impact, and refining execution as they roll out across the company. To date, information about your company’s working styles has come primarily from employee surveys, which, while valuable, are subject to completion bias and not conducive to tracking real-time change.
 
To bridge that gap with objective, dynamic metrics, you run queries with  the Workplace Analytics Collaboration assessment dashboard – providing your CHRO with a data-driven baseline on employee working patterns and manager practices, and allowing the leadership team to identify opportunities and measure the impact of their initiatives.
