While some applications are only available as either a 32-bit or 64-bit compiled version, others such as Office 365 ProPlus, offer both as 32-bit and 64-bit native compiled code. One of biggest decisions you will make within your organization is which version to deploy. To take advantage of additional compute power and RAM on new devices Microsoft recommends using the 64-bit version when there are no 32-bit dependencies that were discovered during the device and app readiness step.
