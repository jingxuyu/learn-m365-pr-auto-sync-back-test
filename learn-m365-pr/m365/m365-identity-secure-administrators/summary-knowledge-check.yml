    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Why do administrator accounts require enhanced security?"
      choices:
      - content: "Because administrators travel frequently, they are more likely to use unsecured devices to access their organization’s resources remotely."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Administrators are not more likely than other staff to use unsecured devices."
      - content: "Administrators typically have supervisory access to the personal files of their direct reports."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Administrators usually do not have access to personal files of their direct reports."
      - content: "Administrators frequently have privileged access to sensitive data and therefore are often targets of cyberattacks."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Hackers target administrator accounts to gain access to an organization’s sensitive data and systems."
    - content: "How could you ensure that administrators use secure mobile devices to access the organization’s network?"
      choices:
      - content: "Create a Conditional Access policy that only grants access to managed and compliant devices."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "Conditional Access uses a combination of user, location, device, app, and other risk conditions to ensure only the right users have access to apps and data."
      - content: "Use Azure Information Protection to control how data is accessed from employee devices."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "You use Azure Information Protection to classify and protect documents and emails, not to secure mobile devices."
      - content: "Enable single sign-on for mobile devices."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Single sign-on would not by itself guarantee that a device is trusted and compliant."
    - content: "Which of these methods would best lower the exposure risk of privileged administrator accounts?"
      choices:
      - content: "Require all critical administrator accounts to use single sign-on."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "Requiring single-on would not reduce the risk posed by phishing attacks."
      - content: "Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to set time-limited access of privileged roles."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "You can use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management to set as-needed access to administrator accounts that access sensitive data."
      - content: "For administrator roles, set a Conditional Access policy that restricts access to sensitive data from noncompliant devices."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "A better method would be to reduce persistent access to sensitive data."
