Power BI harnesses the power of artificial intelligence in a number of ways to benefit different types of personas like data scientists, analysts, and end users.  Data scientists need to integrate and extend the capabilities of Power BI with other established technologies like Python visualizations or R scripts.  Analysts have a different focus on AI, creating machine learning models and making sense of the data using existing capabilities in Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cognitive Services.

For end-users, AI is used to help them explore their data and gain insights with natural language Q&A capabilities and insightful visualizations.
