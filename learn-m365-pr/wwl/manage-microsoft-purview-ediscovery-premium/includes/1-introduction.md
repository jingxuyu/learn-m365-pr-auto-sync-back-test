Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) builds on the existing set of eDiscovery capabilities in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Standard). For example, you can use the eDiscovery (Premium) features in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to search for all data that may be relevant to a specific legal case. You can then analyze that data by applying the text analytics, machine learning, and the relevance/predictive coding capabilities of eDiscovery (Premium).

In this module, you'll examine the steps for setting up eDiscovery (Premium). You'll also learn how to manage eDiscovery (Premium) cases by using the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. The module will examine the various steps that must be completed to manage a workflow in eDiscovery (Premium). These steps include:

 -  Adding custodians to cases.
 -  Searching custodial data sources for relevant case data.
 -  Adding data to a review set.
 -  Reviewing and analyzing the data in a review set.
 -  Exporting and downloading the case data.

The module concludes with a review of the toolset provided in eDiscovery (Premium) to analyze case data. These tools are designed to make the review process more manageable, efficient, and effective. It can be difficult for organizations to review all the collected documents in a review set when a large number of documents are involved. This set of tools provided by eDiscovery (Premium) helps organizations analyze documents, and ultimately reduce the volume of documents to be reviewed without any loss in information. They can also help organize the documents in a coherent manner.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium) builds on eDiscovery (Standard).
 -  Describe the basic workflow of eDiscovery (Premium).
 -  Create and manage cases in eDiscovery (Premium).
