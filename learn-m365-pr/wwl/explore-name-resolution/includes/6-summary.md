This module explores how name resolution works. Name resolution is used to access services by name as an alternative to the IP address. Windows clients are configured to contact specific DNS servers for resolving names. Local DNS servers communicate with root and other domain DNS servers to resolve addresses on external networks and establish as connection between the client and target server. Different types of DNS records are used to identify different types of services, such as a mail server, for a particular domain. Tools such as IPConfig and NSLookup can be used to query and troubleshoot DNS services.
