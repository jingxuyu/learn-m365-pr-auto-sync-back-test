RBAC is primarily designed for delegating and managing administrative permissions. But in Exchange it's also used to assign self-service permissions to end users. By allowing users to manage some of their own user attributes and even run basic diagnostics on their own mailbox, you can reduce the work of your HelpDesk.

In this module, you'll examine how to manage user roles using built-in role assignment policies and management role assignment policies. You'll also learn how to create new roles, role assignments, and scopes.
