While authentication protects against unauthorized access to data, it doesn't protect against unauthorized use of the data. Windows Information Protection provides technologies for managing and governing how data is used. These processes can apply rules to data regardless of where it exists, such as if a document is shared or e-mailed. Rules can be created to automatically classify and protect data based on certain criteria. Data encryption, such as EFS and BitLocker, protect the data in the event the device itself is compromised or if extra security beyond folder permissions is needed.
