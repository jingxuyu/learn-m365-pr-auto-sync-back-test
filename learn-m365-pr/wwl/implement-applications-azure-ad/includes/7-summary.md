This module examined the various administrative tasks for implementing applications. These tasks include adding an application, updating an application, configuring multi-tenant applications, and removing an application.

In this module, you learned that enterprise developers and software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers can develop commercial cloud services or line-of-business applications that can be integrated with Azure AD. These applications can provide secure sign-in and authorization for their services. To integrate an application or service with Azure AD, a developer must first register the application with Azure AD. To support this task, you learned how to register a new application using the Azure portal.

Once your application has been registered with Azure AD, it may need to be updated to provide access to web APIs. This process makes the app available in other organizations. This module examined the various ways in which you can further configure your applications. This examination focused on the consent framework, which is important to understand when building applications that need to be used by other users or applications.

This module then examined how to modify the configuration of a single-tenant application to make it a multi-tenant application. Single-tenant apps can only be accessed by users in your organization. Conversely, multi-tenant apps are accessible to users in external organizations.

The module concluded by showing how to remove an application's registration from your Azure AD tenant.
