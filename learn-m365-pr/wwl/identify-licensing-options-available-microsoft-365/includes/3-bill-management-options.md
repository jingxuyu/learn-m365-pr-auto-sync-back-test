Microsoft 365 billing is managed from the Microsoft 365 admin center. The admin center allows you to manage subscriptions, view billing statements, update payment methods, change your billing frequency, and more. The following list describes in further detail what can be reviewed and modified in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

 -  Upgrade, renew, reactivate or cancel subscriptions.
 -  View the number of purchased licenses and how many of those licenses are assigned to individual users for each service.
 -  View a bill, invoice, and past billing statements.
 -  Modify payment methods like updating, deleting, replacing, and adding other types of payment. Payment options can include credit or debit card, bank account, or pay by invoice using a check or electronic funds transfer (EFT).
 -  Modify your billing frequency to monthly or annual billing.
 -  Buy and manage other services or features. For example, depending on your Microsoft 365 subscription, you can add on Advanced eDiscovery storage or Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
 -  Manage your billing notification emails and invoice attachments, such as the list of email accounts of who should receive automated billing notifications, and renewal reminders for the subscription.
