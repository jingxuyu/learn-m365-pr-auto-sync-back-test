quiz:
  questions:
  - content: "Which is the correct definition of ransomware?"
    choices:
    - content: "Malicious code that steals data and auctions it off to the highest bidder."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Although data is often stolen, it can be sold to the highest bidder whether the ransom is paid or not."
    - content: "Malicious code that allows files to be accessed, but important parts are missing until a ransom is paid."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Ransomware doesn't leave files partially encrypted."
    - content: "Malicious code that blocks access to a computer and/or its files, and demands a ransom for their release."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The files are encrypted, and access is blocked until the ransom is paid."
  - content: "If a user opens an email and select a link that turns out to be malicious, what type of attack is this?"
    choices:
    - content: "Phishing Attack"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Phishing is a social engineering attack, where the attacker relies on a user to select a link without properly checking it's valid."
    - content: "Smishing Attack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A smishing attack uses text messages that contain links to fraudulent sites."
    - content: "Vishing Attack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Vishing relies on the power of voice to trick a user into divulging information useful to the attacker."
  - content: "Which explanation best describes a ransomware family?"
    choices:
    - content: "Cybercriminals who use ransomware to disrupt and extort money."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. The alternative term for cybercriminals is ransomware actors."
    - content: "Ransomware code that works in a similar way to other ransomware code."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Certain attacks work in a similar way and have comparable code characteristics, which is why they're called ransomware families."
    - content: "Licensed ransomware that cybercriminals can purchase from each other."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This is known as ransomware-as-a-service and allows cybercriminals who aren't necessarily technically aware to run attacks."
  - content: "If an attacker managed to gain control of a water supply company's computer system and changed the level of additives in the drinking water, what type of attack would this be?"
    choices:
    - content: "Commodity ransomware"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Commodity ransomware relies on a lapse of judgment from an individual to help the attacker, either by clicking on a file that contains malicious code, or by giving away information."
    - content: "Ransom distributed denial-of-service attack"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. A distributed denial-of-service attack works by flooding the system with so much information that it effectively grinds to a halt, and stops legitimate work being carried out."
    - content: "â€¢	Human-operated ransomware"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The attacker is specifically targeting a business to maximize the impact on the company and the general public."
