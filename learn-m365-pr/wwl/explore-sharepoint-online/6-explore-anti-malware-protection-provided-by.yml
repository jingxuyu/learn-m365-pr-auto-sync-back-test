quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "During some malware outbreaks, Microsoft's anti-malware team may have enough information about a virus or other form of malware to write sophisticated policy rules that detect the threat even before a definition is available from any of the engines used by the service. Which of the following anti-malware protection options provides this level of protection?"
    choices:
    - content: "Layered defenses against malware"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This level of protection provides multiple anti-malware scan engines to help protect against both known and unknown threats. Try again."
    - content: "Real-time threat response"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The rules created by Microsoft's anti-malware team are published to the global network every 2 hours to provide your organization with an extra layer of protection against attacks."
    - content: "Fast anti-malware definition deployment"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. With this level of protection, Microsoft's anti-malware team maintains close relationships with partners who develop anti-malware engines. As a result, the service can receive and integrate malware definitions and patches before they're publicly released. Try again."
