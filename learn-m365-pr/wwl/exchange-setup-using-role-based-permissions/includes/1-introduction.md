Microsoft Exchange Server is dependent on Active Directory. Exchange stores relevant settings, such as proxy addresses and SendAs permission, in Active Directory rather than Exchange. This interconnection requires several considerations in enterprise environments because the job roles of a messaging administrator and an Active Directory administrator differ substantially. A messaging administrator must plan and configure permissions carefully so as not to put their environment or their entire Active Directory at risk.

To support the varying needs to separate the management of Exchange and Active Directory, Exchange 2013 and later lets you choose whether you want a shared permissions model or a split permissions model. Exchange offers two types of split permissions models, RBAC and Active Directory, but it defaults to a shared permissions model.

This module examines these models and identifies the major differences between them.
