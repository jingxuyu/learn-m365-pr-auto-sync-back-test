  questions:
  - content: "What do connections to on-premises data sources, such as an on-premises SharePoint service, require to provide quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data and the Power Platform products?"
    choices:
    - content: "Microsoft Dataverse"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Microsoft Dataverse is a type of data source. It lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications."
    - content: "Environments"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. Environments are a security model component. They act as security boundaries by allowing different security needs to be implemented in each environment."
    - content: "On-premises data gateway"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. Connections to on-premises data sources, such as an on-premises SharePoint service, require the use of an on-premises data gateway. It acts as a bridge to provide quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data and Microsoft cloud services, including Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI. By using a gateway, organizations can keep databases and other data sources on their on-premises networks, yet securely use that on-premises data in cloud services."
