File storage is part of so many applications, and itâ€™s a much better experience for users if they can access the files directly where they are working. For Microsoft 365 users, those files are in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint. In this module, you've built an app that can display, download, and upload these files. You also saw the power of the Microsoft Graph SDK, which simplified the process of setting up a session for large file uploads.
