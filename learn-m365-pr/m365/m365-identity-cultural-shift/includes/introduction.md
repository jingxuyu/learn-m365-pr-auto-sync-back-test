## Change behaviors to support identity protection

Azure Active Directory (AD) Identity Protection is a tool that allows organizations to:

- Automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks.
- Investigate risks using data in the portal.
- Export risk detection data to third-party utilities for further analysis.

Identity Protection uses what Microsoft has learned from Azure AD, Microsoft accounts, and Xbox customers to protect users. Microsoft analyzes 6.5 trillion signals per day to identify and protect customers from threats.

With Azure Active Directory Identity Protection policies, you can:

- Require users to register for Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Automate remediation of risky sign-ins and compromised users through Azure MFA and self-service password reset.

All Identity Protection policies impact the sign-in experience for users. Allowing users to register for and use tools like Azure MFA and self-service password reset reduce that impact. These tools along with the appropriate policy choices gives users a self-remediation option when they need it.
