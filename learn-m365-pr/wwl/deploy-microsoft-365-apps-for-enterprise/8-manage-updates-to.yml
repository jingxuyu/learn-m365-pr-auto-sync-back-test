  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "In which update model can administrators check for updated builds from an internal source?"
    choices:
    - content: "Automatic from cloud"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This option is the default mode (typically used for home or small office installations) where updates download from the cloud. Try again."
    - content: "Automatic from network"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. In managed deployments, administrators can specify (by using Group Policy or the configuration.xml file during setup) to check for updated builds from an internal source."
    - content: "Rerun setup.exe by using Electronic Software Delivery (ESD)"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. In large organizations, using an ESD such as Configuration Manager enables even more fine-grained control of update scheduling. You can use scripts or task sequences in the ESD to re-execute setup.exe /configure. Try again."
