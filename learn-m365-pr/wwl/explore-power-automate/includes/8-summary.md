Power Automate is one of the four product pillars of Microsoftâ€™s Power Platform. It provides a low-code platform for building workflow and process automation. This module examined how to use Power Automate to build workflows that meet your business needs and interact with your business data. You also learned how to administer Power Automate.

This module began by examining the different types of flows in Power Automate:

 -  Automated flows
 -  Instant flows
 -  Scheduled flows
 -  Business process flows
 -  UI flows (preview)

The module then examined how Power Automate uses connectors to attach flows to data. When creating flows, you learned how to create a blank flow from scratch. You also learned how to define the triggers and actions that drive flows.

The module concluded by examining how to run a flow in Power Automate, SharePoint, Teams, and the Power Automate mobile phone app.
