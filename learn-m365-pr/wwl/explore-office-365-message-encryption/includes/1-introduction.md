Office 365 Message Encryption (OME) is an intuitive service that enables email users to send encrypted messages to people inside and outside their organization. Selected recipients can easily view their encrypted messages and return encrypted replies. Regardless of the destination email service—whether it's Microsoft 365, Outlook.com, Yahoo, Gmail, or another service—email users can send confidential business communications with an added level of protection against unauthorized access.

This module will introduce you to OME, including how Office 365 Message Encryption works. You'll learn that OME is an online service that's built on Microsoft Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS), which is part of Azure Information Protection. This service includes encryption, identity, and authorization policies to help secure your email. Messages can be encrypted by using rights management templates.

You'll then be introduced to working with encrypted emails. While detailed guidance about how to send and view encrypted messages is outside the scope of this training, resource links are provided if you're interested in exploring the encryption process in more detail.

This module concludes with an examination of Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption. You'll also be introduced to other encryption methods that can be used in Microsoft 365.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe when you can use Office 365 Message Encryption.
 -  Explain how Office 365 Message Encryption works.
 -  Compare Office 365 Message Encryption and S/MIME.
 -  Explain how Office 365 Advanced Message Encryption offers additional capabilities on top of the standard Office 365 Message Encryption capabilities.
 -  Identify additional encryption capabilities that can be configured to meet certain compliance or legal requirements.
