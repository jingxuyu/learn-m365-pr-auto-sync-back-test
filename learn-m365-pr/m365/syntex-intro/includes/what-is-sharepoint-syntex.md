SharePoint Syntex is a Microsoft 365 service that allows your organization to easily do three main things:

- Use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to amplify human experiences
- Automate content processing
- Transform content into tangible knowledge

With SharePoint Syntex, you use AI and machine learning to automatically and thoughtfully find, organize, and classify documents in your SharePoint library. Being able to work more effectively with your content and the data within it creates stronger business processes. If your team can label and categorize your content more accurately, you can use this information to implement better business processes. If your team can build templates based on the business documents you use the most, you can build those documents more quickly and with fewer errors. Greater organization of your data creates better organization of your business.  

How this is achieved can be broken into three parts: **document understanding**, **form processing**, and **content compliance**.

## Document understanding

The first part of SharePoint Syntex is document understanding. Using AI, you can classify and extract the information that you pre-define in your content so that metadata is _automatically_ applied, appearing as columns in your SharePoint document library. Document understanding allows for quicker and more efficient understanding of the information within your content.  

At Contoso Electronics, automated and AI-driven document understanding models could be valuable for documents like inquiries, which often have less uniformity and structure, but still need to be processed and understood in a timely manner.

## Form processing

Forms processing is the "assembly-line" part of SharePoint Syntex. This is where AI models take in _structured_ and _semi-structured_ documents to capture, ingest, and categorize the content so that business processes can be streamlined.

At Contoso, form processing could handle items such as sales contracts. These contracts have specific information and concrete data that is kept within a uniform structure. Information from these contracts needs to be extracted so that your colleagues have exactly what they need to process the contracts for the accounting review.

## Content compliance

Understanding your content allows for better organization. Organization increases management and governance options for all your data. When content is properly tagged and labeled, you have better control over your data and can follow regulations more easily. Being able to correctly process data is key to ensuring that it's secure and accurate.  

Contoso receives and handles sensitive client information. Being able to easily locate and dispose of this data when appropriate will set the company and its clients up for compliance and data governance success and help Accounting meet their deadline.
