Protecting personal data requires security controls such as robust access control management, proper data classification, and data encryption. But security on its own cannot solve privacy problems.

Privacy is about being accountable for and respecting a customer's choices. It is about being accountable for the collection, control, access to, and distribution of personal data. It is also about providing ways for customers to manage their preferences.

Microsoft has six primary privacy principles:
* Control. This means putting everyone in control of their own privacy with easy to use tools and clear choices.
* Transparency. Being transparent abut data collection, and how data is being used, so that everyone can make informed decisions.
* Security. Protecting the data that is entrusted to Microsoft through strong security and encryption.
* Strong legal protections. Respecting local privacy laws and fighting for legal protection of users' privacy as a fundamental human right.
* No content-based targeting. Not using email, chat, files, or other personal content to target advertising.
* Benefit to you. This means collecting data only for the benefit of users, and to make the experience better.

These privacy principles are the foundation of our commitment to our commercial customers. We are committed to ensuring the privacy of organizations through our contractual agreements that govern how we process data and protect data privacy for commercial customers.
