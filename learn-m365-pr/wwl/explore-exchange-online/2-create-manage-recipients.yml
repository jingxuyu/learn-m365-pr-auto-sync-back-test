    choices:
    - content: "A Dynamic Distribution Group is the most common form of a globally available distribution list for sending out one-to-many e-mail messages.

A Distribution Group is the most common form of a globally available distribution list for sending out one-to-many e-mail messages. A Dynamic Distribution Group is commonly used to create a global company distribution list using attributes in the company address book, such as region, office, department, or roles. Try again."

      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. A Dynamic Distribution Group dynamically creates a set of users based on an LDAP query in Active Directory to distribute messages. A Distribution Group distributes messages to the list of assigned users to the group."
