Every event, whether virtual or in-person, should be accessible to all. As you prepare the content and people for your up-and-coming virtual event, you intend to ensure it is as accessible and engaging as possible.

Here you'll explore how to design for accessibility, with a focus on the logistics and content being presented.

## Event accessibility

Accessibility and inclusivity begin with your event planning. Building on the event design model above, your advertisement and promotion of the event need to be accessible to everyone. The text and images used should apply accessibility best practices where possible:

- Sans serif fonts are easier to read for various reading levels.
- Use larger fonts for the key information.
- Color contrast of 4.5:1 for smaller text, and 3:1 for large text.
- Unjustified text is more legible as readers are less likely to lose their place.
- Try to use Personal First Language when referring to specific abilities (for example an "engineer with dyslexia" rather than "dyslexic person").

Next, focus on the invitation you send to people, normally by email. Keep the accessibility concepts in mind, but also avoid using only images to convey information. If you do use any images in digital media, make sure each image has alternative text.

You can also collect information about any accessibility accommodations your potential attendees might need. In your invite or registration form, ask attendees if they have any needs. Also include any information about sensory experiences, like loud music or flashing lights. If you're using Microsoft Outlook, you can run the accessibility checker on your final email.

Inclusivity isn't just about the people attending your invite. During the planning phase, try to bring in as wide a range of presenters and speakers as you can. Consolidate the presenter diversity in your event team, so that you can capture diverse perspectives there, too.

The platform you use for registration is a great place to capture accommodations. Consider asking if people need any of these:

- Captioned videos and live captioning of presentations
- Sign language interpretation, and whether they prefer American Sign Language (ASL) or Universal Sign Language (USL)
- Other language interpretations
- Presentation materials before the event
- Large print or braille versions of handouts

Plan enough time for all your presenters, moderators, and producers to train on the tools they'll be using before the actual event. As you'll have a diverse event team, all your training materials need to be accessible. The training should also help presenters think about how their presentations can be made more accessible, such as calling out important items on screen. All this training should culminate in one or more dress rehearsals. Each rehearsal allows the presenters to become comfortable with the tools, the producers to work out any technical issues, and the moderators to refine the interactive experience they'd like for your attendees.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Giving everyone enough time to prepare and rehearse helps reduce the chance of issues. You can=polish the event content and delivery, and keep your event team's morale high and relaxed for success.

## Presentation accessibility

Presentations are at the heart of any event, in-person or virtual, so your slide content and design needs to consider these accessibility concepts.

### Contrast

:::row:::

    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/contrast-text.png" alt-text="Example text on a background color. Three examples two that are good, black text on a white background and white text on a dark blue background. One bad example of white text on a light blue background." border="false":::

        </div>
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Use high contrast colors. The minimum contrast you should use is 4.5:1. But for larger text, use as much as 3:1. 


        
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Shape and color

:::row:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="../media/shape-and-color.png" alt-text="Example graphic showing text and different colored shapes.":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

If you're using colors to indicate status, pair color with different shapes. This helps people with color blindness to understand the chart.

### Alternative text

:::row:::

    :::column span="2":::

        To add alt text to an object in Microsoft PowerPoint, right click and select **Edit Alt Text**. Add one or two detailed sentences that describe the graphic.

        Alt text helps people with screen readers to understand the images you use and the content of your slides. Every image in your slide should have alt text and consider grouping individual shapes so that you can describe the slide as a whole. If an object has no meaning, mark it as decorative.

    :::column:::

        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/powerpoint-alt-text-popout.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the alt text pop out in Microsoft PowerPoint.":::

        </div>
        
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Slide layouts

:::row:::

    :::column span="2":::
        Try to use the built-in slide layouts. This will help ensure a hierarchical reading of the text blocks. For example, if this is a title slide, choose a built-in title layout rather than a blank side and adding a text box at the top.

        This will also help when trying to create a good reading order.

    :::column:::
        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/slide-layouts.png" alt-text="Example graphic showing two slides. The top a title slide, the second a content slide.":::

        </div>
    :::column-end:::

:::row-end:::

### Reading order

:::row:::
    :::column:::

        <div align="center">

        :::image type="content" source="../media/selection-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Selection Pane option.":::

        </div>
    :::column-end:::
    :::column span="2":::
        Screen readers are software that describe the content being shown on screen. This is normally in the order it is created. To check that your content is in the correct reading order, arrange your objects in the **Selection Pane** as appropriate.
