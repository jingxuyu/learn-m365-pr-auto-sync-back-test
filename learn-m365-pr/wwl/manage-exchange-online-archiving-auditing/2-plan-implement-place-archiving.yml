  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Tailspin Toys, Alan Deyoung wants to move a user's archive mailbox to another mailbox database on the same Mailbox server. What must Alan do to move the user's archive mailbox?"
    choices:
    - content: "Create a migration batch and perform a remote mailbox move request"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Remote mailbox move requests using migration batches are used to move mailboxes between an on-premises Exchange deployment and an Exchange Online deployment. Try again."
    - content: "Create a mailbox move request"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Alan must create a mailbox move request to move the user's archive mailbox to another mailbox database on the same Mailbox server or to another server, independent of the primary mailbox."
    - content: "Create a migration endpoint for a local mailbox move"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Migration endpoints are used for cross-forest mailbox moves, but not for local mailbox moves. Try again."
