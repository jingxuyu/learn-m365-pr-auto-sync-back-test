Even though Microsoft Teams focuses considerable attention on self-service, there are still some essential management and implementation tasks that must be completed to maximize a deploymentâ€™s effectiveness. For example, even when implementing self-service features, some policies that you create to guide users are important and should be planned with the appropriate diligence.

In this module you will learn about rollout paths to deploy Teams, user adoption, and licensing. By the end of the module you should have insight into the different management tools that are available with Teams, and the different clients that can work with Teams content. You will also learn how to interpret Microsoft 365 and Teams usage reports to understand user adoption. 

After this module, you will be able to:

- Describe different Teams admin roles. 
- Describe available admin tools to manage Teams.
- Plan for Teams rollout and adoption. 
- Identify required licensing for Teams. 
- Deploy Teams clients. 
- Analyze usage patterns by monitoring Microsoft 365 and Teams usage reports.
