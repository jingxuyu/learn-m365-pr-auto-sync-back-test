Cyber security breaches are a huge expenditure in today’s internet-based world. As such, it’s important that organizations invest in prevention rather than just recovery from a security breach. The average cost of recovering from a typical cyber-security breach is so high because organizations rarely spend much money on the preparation or ability to execute action plans BEFORE (or during) a cyberattack. Rather, most organizations spend the bulk of this money on remediation costs AFTER the attack has occurred. These costs typically stem from litigation, brand damage, and even loss of business.

One of the aspects of today’s cyberthreat landscape is its scale. The reach of cyberthreat tentacles is so widespread throughout an organization that it makes it hard to absorb the extensive and incessant pool of information, and then understand which information is most relevant among the noise.

Since Microsoft 365 hosts one of the largest networks in the world and manages content created on millions of devices, it's built:

 -  a vast repository of threat intelligence data.
 -  the systems needed to spot patterns that correspond to attack behaviors and suspicious activity.

Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence is a collection of these insights, which can help you proactively find and eliminate threats.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft 365 Threat Intelligence is available with Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5. If your organization is using another Microsoft 365 Enterprise subscription, Threat Intelligence can be purchased as an add-on.

So, what exactly is threat intelligence? Gartner’s definition reads as follows: ***Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, including context, mechanisms, indicators, implications and actionable advice, about an existing or emerging menace or hazard to assets that can be used to inform decisions about the subject’s response to that menace or hazard.***

In this module, you'll learn about the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph. This feature powers threat intelligence in Microsoft 365 by consuming billions of signals across the Microsoft 365 network from sources such as user activity, authentication, email, compromised PCs, and security incidents.

You'll also be introduced to the two main features of threat intelligence in Microsoft 365, the Security Dashboard and Threat Explorer. These tools provide admins with evidence-based knowledge and actionable advice. Admins can use this information to make informed decisions about protecting and responding to cyber-attacks against their tenant.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how threat intelligence in Microsoft 365 is powered by the Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph.
 -  Describe how the threat dashboard can benefit C-level security officers.
 -  Understand how Threat Explorer can be used to investigate threats and help to protect your tenant.
 -  Describe the Threat Tracker widgets and views that provide you with intelligence on different cybersecurity issues that might impact your company.
 -  Run realistic attack scenarios using Attack Simulator to help identify vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your organization
 -  Describe how threat hunting enables security operators to cybersecurity threats.
 -  Describe how Advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender proactively inspects events in your network to locate threat indicators and entities.
