Networks are the communication backbone of our modern society. They range from the network of interconnected devices in your home, and those used by large multinational companies, to the largest network of them all, the internet. Protecting your network is essential to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of your data. By applying the principles of Zero Trust to networking, you can use segmentation to limit possible exposure should a cybercriminal gain unauthorized access to your network. You can use threat protection tools to identify weaknesses in your network perimeter and harden them to prevent cybercriminals from breaching network security. Using network encryption standards, you can ensure that all your data is encrypted as it travels over your network.

Now that youâ€™ve completed this module, you should be able to:

- Describe a network and network encryption.
- Describe how network segmentation can limit the scope of a data breach.
- Describe threat protection and some of the tools you can use to protect your network.
