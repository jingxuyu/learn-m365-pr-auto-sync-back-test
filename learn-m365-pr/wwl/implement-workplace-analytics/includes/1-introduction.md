>The Workplace Analytics web app is being rebranded to **Viva Insights** in the next few months. As mentioned in this module, Workplace Analytics refers to the web app with advanced analysis tools and accelerators available to those who are assigned the Analyst, Limited Analyst, or Admin role.

This module examines Workplace Analytics, which provides powerful organizational analytics solutions. Workplace Analytics is generally available as an add-on to any Microsoft 365 enterprise plan.

Workplace Analytics taps into Microsoft 365 email and calendar metadata, including to/from data, subject lines, and timestamps. Its goal is to shine a light on how the organization collaborates and spends time. It turns this digital exhaust—the data that comes naturally from our everyday work—into a set of behavioral metrics that can be used to understand what’s going on in an organization.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe how Workplace Analytics can help organizations in analyzing sales productivity, manage effectiveness, and space planning.
- Describe how data protection is maintained in Workplace Analytics.
- Describe how data privacy is maintained in Workplace Analytics.
- Configure Workplace Analytics.
