You should be aware that computers are only tools, which allow users to perform their jobs. If a computer fails, the user likely will not be able to perform their job. Because of that, you should attempt to repair the computer as soon as possible. If you determine the estimated recovery time is longer than what's acceptable, it's often faster and more efficient to replace the computer. Many organizations have SLAs and warranties with hardware vendors in place. Therefore, before you replace defective hardware, consider any procedures that your SLAs mandate must occur before you can obtain replacement hardware. You could fix your hardware problem more quickly, and reduce the impact on your users’ productivity and your organization’s budget. You also should remember to check for basic issues before attempting to replace hardware devices.

### SLAs

An SLA can specify what to do when hardware fails, and how to log a failure incident with your organization’s service desk. The SLA also can dictate the expected response and replacement time for device replacement. Procedures also must be in place to ensure that sufficient spare hardware devices are available. Some companies maintain a hardware list of the available spare devices.

### Warranties

Most hardware vendors include a warranty with their products. The warranty generally lasts for an initial period, such as 12 months, and covers the hardware against failure during that period. A basic warranty often includes a next-business-day response for device replacement. For a fee, most hardware vendors offer additional warranty services with shorter response and replacement times. A typical option may specify a four-hour telephone response time, with an engineer scheduled to visit the site within eight hours to provide an on-site fix. Ensure that SLAs cover warranty agreements or other contracts with the manufacturer or hardware vendor.

### Escalation procedures

Providing appropriate escalation procedures and resources can be as simple as providing a contact telephone number for the hardware vendor. However, most procedures also should include providing a customer account number for the vendor, a specific contact name, and any pertinent contract details. This makes service-desk employees aware of agreed-upon response times.

### Issues with data security

If you need to replace a hard disk due to a hardware problem, you may need to return the broken disk to the manufacturer. If so, check your organization’s security requirements for removing sensitive or confidential data from the hard disk before you return it.
