The internet has made the world a smaller place by making more and more of it accessible to everyone. The rapid expansion of high-speed broadband and an always-on culture has increased the ways in which cybercriminals can attack an individual or organization's computers and devices. Data is money, and cybercrime is one of the fastest growing businesses in the world. Ransomware is the latest in a long line of tools used by cybercriminals to cause maximum disruption at a low cost with high rewards.

In this high-stakes game, both individuals and organizations can become victims. But how do you know whether an attack is happening? How do you respond? And can you even recover from the attack? In this module, you'll learn how to detect a ransomware attack and learn about the measures to take to recover from it.
