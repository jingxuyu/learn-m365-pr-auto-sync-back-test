Data loss prevention (DLP) is a security feature that protects sensitive data in email, SharePoint content, and Office files from being accidentally or intentionally shared with unauthorized users. For instance, DLP can prevent someone from sharing personal information or intellectual property, or stop someone from accidentally emailing a file attachment to an unauthorized recipient.

This module examines the fundamentals of data loss prevention in Exchange and SharePoint. Data loss prevention is configured through DLP policies. Policies consist of conditions and actions that are centered around identifying sensitive information data. In this module, you'll learn how conditions and actions work together to support data loss prevention in Microsoft 365.

This module also introduces you to Endpoint data loss prevention. Endpoint DLP extends the activity monitoring and protection capabilities of DLP to sensitive items that are physically stored on Windows 10, Windows 11, and macOS devices.

This module also introduces you to three key reporting tools that organizations can use to view DLP policy violations and triage actions taken on sensitive information:

 -  DLP Alerts dashboard
 -  DLP reports
 -  DLP Activity explorer

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe how Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is managed in Microsoft 365.
 -  Understand how DLP in Microsoft 365 uses sensitive information types and search patterns.
 -  Describe how Microsoft Endpoint DLP extends the DLP activity monitoring and protection capabilities.
 -  Describe what a DLP policy is and what it contains.
 -  View DLP policy results using both queries and reports.
