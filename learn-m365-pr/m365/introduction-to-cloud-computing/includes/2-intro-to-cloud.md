In an ever-growing landscape of devices, computers, and collaboration, cloud computing plays an increasingly important role in how you offer and consume IT services.    

## What is cloud computing? 
It’s a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else’s data center. Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your data center, you rent them for the time that you need them.  The cloud provider (in this case, Microsoft) is responsible for the physical hardware required to execute your work, and for keeping it available and up to date. What you’re responsible for maintaining versus what the cloud service provider is responsible for maintaining depends on the service model you’re using.
