This module explored different solutions in the Microsoft Compliance Center that can address specific compliance scenarios. You learned how to configure insider risk management, and specifically, insider risk management policies.

Managing and minimizing risk in an organization starts with understanding the types of risks found in the modern workplace. Some risks are driven by external events and factors and are outside direct control. Other risks are driven by internal events and employee activities that can be eliminated and avoided. Some examples are risks from illegal, inappropriate, unauthorized, or unethical behavior and actions by employees and managers.

After exploring insider risk management and insider risk management policies, you then were introduced to insider risk management alerts. You learned how these alerts are automatically generated by risk indicators defined in insider risk management policies. They give compliance analysts and investigators an all-up view of the current risk status and enable an organization to triage and take actions for discovered risks.

You then explored communication compliance in the Compliance Center. Communication compliance policies scan and capture messages across several communication channels to help organizations quickly review and remediate compliance issues. Communication compliance helps organizations address common pain points associated with following internal policies and regulatory compliance requirements.

The module concluded with a review of the toolset provided by Microsoft 365 to address data protection and compliance. The tools you were introduced to included Service Trust Portal, Compliance Manager, and the GDPR toolbox.
