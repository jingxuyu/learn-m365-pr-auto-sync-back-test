Taking this path will help your new internet-based devices become enrolled into Intune.

Here's what you need to set it up:

1. [Setup enhanced HTTP](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/hierarchy/enhanced-http.md)  
2. [Create the cloud services in Azure](/mem/configmgr/core/servers/deploy/configure/azure-services-wizard.md)  
3. [Configure the management point and clients to use the cloud management gateway](/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/cmg/setup-cloud-management-gateway.md)  
4. [Use Intune to deploy the Configuration Manager client](/mem/configmgr/comanage/how-to-prepare-Win10.md)
