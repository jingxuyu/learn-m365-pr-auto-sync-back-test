This process occurs even though there's no outbound spam filter rule (sender filters) associated with the policy. Creating custom policies with stricter settings than the Default policy enables organizations to increase the effectiveness of its outbound spam filtering. However, creating custom policies isn't required if organizations are comfortable with the Default policy settings."
