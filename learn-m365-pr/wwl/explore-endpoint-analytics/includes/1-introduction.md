Sometimes there are issues that impact user productivity less visible or historically difficult to pinpoint. Help desk tickets containing a title along the lines of "User reports device seems slow" are as old as the computer itself. What's worse is users might come to accept a device's poor performance, ignoring a real issue that ultimately reduces productivity. When this issue is reported, it can often be labor-intensive trying to identify to root cause.

Endpoint Analytics is cloud-based service that monitors the health of devices and provides insights into some of that user experience. Endpoint analytics can help identify policies or hardware issues that ultimately create a poor user experience, and help remediate those issues.

### Objectives
