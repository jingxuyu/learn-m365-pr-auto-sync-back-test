The pandemic has fundamentally transformed the way we work, do business, and meet customer needs, and more. So much can be done remotely than we ever thought possible. Hybrid and flexible work is here to stay, and organizations are trying to navigate this new way of operating. Changes are needed to support workers that are fully remote, who choose to go to the office, who must remain onsite such as frontline workers, and who do a combination of both.

No one has carried the burden of the past couple of years more than frontline workers. Frontline workers often compose most of the workforce and are in roles where they're the first to engage customers, the first to see products and services in action, and the first to represent your brand. They're the backbone of hybrid operations for all major industries. Despite their essential role in every industry, these workers have traditionally been underserved by technology.

Microsoft wants you and your organization to thrive in a hybrid world. Hybrid work is inevitable and so it's essential to create the culture to enable it. Organizations should set a clear flexible work policy that gives all types of workers the choice in how, when, and where they work.

**Microsoft 365** has the capabilities to empower your organization to meet the diverse needs of your workers, giving them the ability to work either onsite or remotely:

 -  **Stay connected** from anywhere in the world and at any time. Your workers are able to access:
    
     -  Cloud-based services and data in your Microsoft 365 subscription.
     -  Organization resources, such as those offered by on-premises application datacenters.
 -  **Secure sign-ins** with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and built-in security features of Microsoft 365 and Windows protect against malware, malicious attacks, and data loss.
 -  **Manage your hybrid worker's devices** from the cloud with security settings, allowed apps, and to require compliance with system health.
 -  **Be just as collaborative and productive** as on-premises in a highly collaborative way with:
    
     -  Online meetings, chat sessions, and push-to-talk communication with Teams.
     -  Shared workspaces for cloud-based file storage with global accessibility and real-time collaboration with SharePoint and OneDrive.
     -  Shared tasks and workflows to divide up the work and get things done.
