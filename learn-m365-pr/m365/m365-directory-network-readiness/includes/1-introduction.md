Directory and network readiness is a fundamental step in your OS and desktop deployment. Your network needs to support transferring large files to hundreds or thousands of PCs at a time. As with any automated deployment, it’s important to ensure that users can reach file shares, that files and settings are available, and that your network isn't overloaded.

As part of your shift to Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus you’ll set up cloud-based identity with **Azure Active Directory** (Azure AD). This is key for activating Office 365 ProPlus and also allows you to use modern provisioning solutions like Windows Autopilot. In this module, we explore the tools and options to prepare your directory services and network for deployment.
