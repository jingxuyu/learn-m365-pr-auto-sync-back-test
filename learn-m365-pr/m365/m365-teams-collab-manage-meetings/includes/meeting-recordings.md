In Microsoft Teams, users can record their Teams meetings and group calls to capture audio, video, and screen sharing activity. There is also an option for automatic transcription for recordings, so that users can play back meeting recordings with closed captions and search for important discussion items in the transcript. The recording happens in the cloud and is saved to Microsoft Stream, so users can share it securely across their organization.

For a Teams userâ€™s meetings to be recorded, Microsoft Stream must be enabled. In addition, there are several licensing, permissions, and other setting prerequisites that are required for both the meeting organizer and the person who is initiating the recording:

- User has an appropriate license.
- User needs to be licensed for Microsoft Stream.
- User has Microsoft Stream upload video permissions.
- User has consented to the company guidelines, if set up by the administrator.
- User has sufficient storage in Microsoft Stream for recordings to be saved.
- User has **Allow cloud recording** setting set to **On.**
- User is not an anonymous, guest, or federated user in the meeting.

Meeting recordings are considered tenant-owned content. If the owner of the recording leaves the company, the administrator can access and delete the recording, update any recording metadata, or change permissions for the recording video.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Users don't need a Microsoft Stream license assigned if they only record and download recordings. In this case, recordings aren't stored in Microsoft Stream. Instead the recordings are stored in Azure Media Services (AMS) with a 21-day limit before a recording is deleted.
