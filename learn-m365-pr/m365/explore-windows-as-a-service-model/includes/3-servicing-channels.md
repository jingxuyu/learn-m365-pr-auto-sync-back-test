Although servicing channels may be new to your organization, you still use the same management tools to deploy the updates to your organizationâ€™s devices that you used in earlier versions of Windows. These include: 

- **Windows Insider Program**. This channel enables users to become familiar with feature updates before they are released to the wider public. Organizations can evaluate these feature updates before trying a wider deployment. In addition, users can provide feedback to Microsoft to help resolve any issues with updates. Feature updates are released to the Windows Insider program about once a week.
- **Semi-annual channel**. Computers configured in the semi-annual channel receive updates as soon as Microsoft publishes them. There are two semi-annual channels: semi-annual (targeted) is aimed at a subset of your users, while semi-annual is aimed at all other users. Feature updates are released to the semi-annual channel twice a year in the spring and fall.
- **Long-term servicing channel**. For computers and other devices that perform a single task or a number of specialized tasks, the long-term servicing channel prevents configured devices from receiving feature updates. However, quality updates delivery is not affected. Note that the Long-term servicing channel (LTSC) is available only in the Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC edition. Feature updates are released to the LTSC about once every three years.
