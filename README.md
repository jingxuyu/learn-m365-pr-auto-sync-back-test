# Microsoft Learn - M365 training content

This repository contains the Microsoft Learn modules and learning paths for Microsoft 365. Review this README file to understand how you can assist in contributing to Microsoft Learn training content.

## Content author and learner experience

The content in the Microsoft Learn repositories is developed, organized, and displayed differently than traditional Docs content.

* **Development**: Modules and learning paths are curated, multi-modal training content that uses a combination of text, interactive activities, knowledge checks, videos, achievements and more. The APEX Learning team, in partnership with content teams, governs the roadmap and quality of content before publishing for all products. 
* **Organization**: Learn repos are typically created for a product family rather than per-product. The content in these repos are aggregated together for the final experience. For example, this means that you could include Azure and Business Applications content into a single learning path. 
* **Display**: There is a single, all-up Microsoft Learn homepage, with a dynamic browser page that allows users to filter content by product. There are usually landing pages for each product family. 

### Home, landing, and browse pages

* [Microsoft Learn - Home Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/) (*Can also access via https://microsoft.com/learn and https://docs.com/learn*)
* [Microsoft Learn - Browse Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/)

## Contributions and feedback

We welcome contributions and feedback. How you contribute depends on organization, product group, and the sort of changes you'd like to contribute. For more information about how to understand the content files, view our [create a module](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/create-a-module?branch=master#implementation) docs.

### Microsoft employees

* **Minor updates**: It's pretty standard: fork the repo and submit updates from your fork. See the [Docs contributor guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/) for more information.

* **New content + major changes**: If you want to create a new module or submit major changes, please submit a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/learn-pr/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) to start a conversation with the APEX Learning team. The APEX Learning team will work with you to plan out when you can begin to upload your content. Once you've agreed to a plan, you'll need to work with an APEX Learning employee to help bring that content in. For more information about Microsoft Learn, review the [Microsoft Learn Docs](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn-docs/docs/?branch).
