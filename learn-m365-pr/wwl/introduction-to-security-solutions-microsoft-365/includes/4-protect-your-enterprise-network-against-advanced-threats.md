Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats. Defender for Endpoint uses a combination of the following technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

 *  **Endpoint behavioral sensors**. Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
    
 *  **Cloud security analytics**. Uses big-data, device-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Microsoft 365), and online assets. Behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.
    
 *  **Threat intelligence**. Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners. Threat intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when they're observed in collected sensor data.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint provides a complete endpoint security solution. It integrates the following features to deliver preventative protection, post-breach detection, automated investigation, and response.


### Threat and vulnerability management

Effectively identifying, assessing, and remediating endpoint weaknesses is pivotal in running a healthy security program and reducing organizational risk. Threat and vulnerability management serves as an infrastructure for reducing organizational exposure, hardening endpoint surface area, and increasing organizational resilience.

Discover vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in real time with sensors, and without the need of agents or periodic scans. It ranks vulnerabilities based on the threat landscape, detections in your organization, sensitive information on vulnerable devices, and business context.

### Attack surface reduction

Help reduce your attack surfaces by minimizing the places where your organization is vulnerable to cyberthreats and attacks. The attack surface reduction set of capabilities provides the first line of defense in the stack. By ensuring configuration settings are properly set and exploit mitigation techniques are applied, the capabilities resist attacks and exploitation. This set of capabilities is defined in the following table.

###  Microsoft Defender Antivirus

The next-generation protection component of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This protection brings together machine learning, big-data analysis, in-depth threat resistance research, and the Microsoft cloud infrastructure to protect devices in your enterprise organization. Your next-generation protection services include the following capabilities:

 *  [Behavior-based, heuristic, and real-time antivirus protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-protection-features-microsoft-defender-antivirus?azure-portal=true), which includes always-on scanning using file and process behavior monitoring and other heuristics (also known as *real-time protection*). It also includes detecting and blocking apps that are considered unsafe, but might not be detected as malware.
 *  [Cloud-delivered protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus?azure-portal=true), which includes near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats.
 *  [Dedicated protection and product updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus?azure-portal=true), which include updates related to keeping Microsoft Defender Antivirus up to date.

### Endpoint detection and response

Endpoint detection and response capabilities are put in place to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats that may have made it past the first two security pillars. [Advanced hunting](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/advanced-hunting-overview?azure-portal=true) provides a query-based threat-hunting tool that lets you proactively find breaches and create custom detections.

Endpoint detection and response capabilities provide advanced attack detections that are near real-time and actionable. Security analysts can prioritize alerts effectively, gain visibility into the full scope of a breach, and take response actions to remediate threats.

When a threat is detected, alerts are created in the system for an analyst to investigate. Alerts with the same attack techniques or attributed to the same attacker are aggregated into an entity called an *incident*. Aggregating alerts in this manner makes it easy for analysts to collectively investigate and respond to threats.

### Automated investigation and remediation

By quickly responding to advanced attacks, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint offers automatic investigation and remediation (AIR) capabilities that help reduce the volume of alerts in minutes at scale.

The technology in automated investigation uses various inspection algorithms and is based on processes that are used by security analysts. AIR capabilities are designed to examine alerts and take immediate action to resolve breaches. AIR capabilities significantly reduce alert volume, allowing security operations to focus on more sophisticated threats and other high-value initiatives. All remediation actions, whether pending or completed, are tracked in the [Action center](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/auto-investigation-action-center?azure-portal=true). In the Action center, pending actions are approved (or rejected), and completed actions can be undone if needed.

### Microsoft Secure Score for Devices

Defender for Endpoint includes Microsoft Secure Score for Devices to help you dynamically assess the security state of your enterprise network, identify unprotected systems, and take recommended actions to improve the overall security of your organization.

Your score for devices is visible in the [threat and vulnerability management dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/tvm-dashboard-insights?azure-portal=true) of the Microsoft Defender Security Center. A higher Microsoft Secure Score for Devices means your endpoints are more resilient from cybersecurity threat attacks. It reflects the collective security configuration state of your devices across the following categories:

 *  Application
 *  Operating system
 *  Network
 *  Accounts
 *  Security controls

### Microsoft Threat Experts

Microsoft Threat Experts is a managed threat hunting service that provides your Security Operation Centers (SOCs) with expert level monitoring and analysis to help them ensure that critical threats in your unique environments don’t get missed.


This managed threat hunting service provides expert-driven insights and data through these two capabilities: targeted attack notification and access to experts on demand. Microsoft Threat Experts provides proactive hunting for the most important threats to your network, including human adversary intrusions, hands-on-keyboard attacks, or advanced attacks like cyber-espionage. These notifications show up as a new alert. The managed hunting service includes:

 *  Threat monitoring and analysis, reducing dwell time and risk to the business.
 *  Hunter-trained artificial intelligence to discover and rank both known and unknown attacks.
 *  Identifying the most important risks, helping SOCs maximize time and energy.
 *  Scope of compromise and as much context as can be quickly delivered to enable fast SOC response.

Organizations an engage Microsoft's security experts directly from within Microsoft Defender Security Center for timely and accurate response. Experts provide insights needed to better understand the complex threats affecting your organization, from alert inquiries, potentially compromised devices, root cause of a suspicious network connection, to extra threat intelligence about ongoing advanced persistent threat campaigns. With this capability, you can:

 *  Get extra clarification on alerts including root cause or scope of the incident.
 *  Gain clarity into suspicious device behavior and next steps if faced with an advanced attacker.
 *  Determine risk and protection concerning threat actors, campaigns, or emerging attacker techniques.
