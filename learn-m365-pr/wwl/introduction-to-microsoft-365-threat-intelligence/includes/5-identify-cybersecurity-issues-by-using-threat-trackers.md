Threat Trackers are informative widgets and views that provide you with intelligence on different cybersecurity issues that might impact your company. For example, you can view information about trending malware campaigns using Threat Trackers. Most tracker pages include trending numbers that are updated periodically, widgets to help you understand which issues are the biggest or have grown the most, and a quick link in the **Actions** column that takes you to Explorer, where you can view more detailed information.

Available Threat Trackers include:

 -  Noteworthy trackers
 -  Trending trackers
 -  Tracked queries
 -  Saved queries.

To view and use your Threat Trackers, go to the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com) and choose **Threat management** &gt; **Threat tracker**.

#### Noteworthy trackers

Noteworthy trackers are where you will find big and smaller threats and risks that we think you should know about. Noteworthy trackers help you find whether these issues exist in your Office 365 environment, plus link to articles (like this one) that give you more details on what is happening, and how they will impact your organization's use of Office 365. Whether it's a big new threat (e.g. Wannacry, Petya) or an existing threat that might create some new challenges (like our other inaugural Noteworthy item - Nemucod), this is where you'll find important new items you and your security team should review and examine periodically.

Typically Noteworthy trackers will be posted for just a couple of weeks when we identify new threats and think you might need the extra visibility that this feature provides. Once the biggest risk for a threat has passed, we'll remove that Noteworthy item. This way, we can keep the list fresh and up to date with other relevant new items.

#### Trending trackers

Trending trackers (formerly called Campaigns) highlight new threats that haven't been seen in your organization's email in the past week. Trending trackers give you an idea of new threats you should review to ensure your broader corporate environment is prepared against attacks.

#### Tracked queries

Tracked queries leverage your saved queries to periodically assess Office 365 activity in your organization. This gives you event trending, with more to come in the coming months. Tracked queries run automatically, giving you up-to-date information without having to remember to re-run your queries.

#### Saved queries

Saved queries are also found in the Trackers section. You can use Saved queries to store the common Explorer searches that you want to get back to quicker and repeatedly, without having to re-create the search every time.

You can always save a Noteworthy tracker query or any of your own Explorer queries using the Save query button at the top of the Explorer page. Anything saved there will show up in the Saved queries list on the Tracker page.
