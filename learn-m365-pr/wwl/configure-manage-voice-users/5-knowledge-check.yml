      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Enabling Teams Voice services for a user enables the Dial Pad functionality in the client. The Dial Plan translates dialed numbers, via normalization, into a format that is recognized by Teams and matches call authorization and voice routing rules."
    - content: "To ensure a user follows a specified format when dialing numbers, so that incorrectly formatted numbers cannot be dialed."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "A dial plan allows a user to enter numbers in format they are most familiar with using local conventions rather than enforce a particular format (such as E.164). The dial plan normalizes and translates the number dialed into a format that matches call authorization and voice routing rules."
    - content: "To enable a user to dial out using local format they are familiar with and translate the number into an alternate format."
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "A dial plan is a named set of normalization rules that translate dialed phone numbers by an individual user into an alternate format (typically E.164) for purposes of call authorization and voice routing. They describe how phone numbers expressed in various formats are translated to an alternate format."
