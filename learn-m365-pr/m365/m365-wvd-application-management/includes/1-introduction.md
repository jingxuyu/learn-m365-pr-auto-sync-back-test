Learn how to deliver applications by using MSIX app attach. MSIX app attach is Microsoft application delivery technology that enables you to separate applications and their state from the operating system and assign applications to users dynamically.

Suppose you work as a senior administrator at Contoso, Ltd., a midsize financial services company in London with a branch office in New York. Contoso has migrated existing Remote Desktop Services to Azure Virtual Desktop, so it no longer needs to manage basic infrastructure components like Remote Desktop Session Host servers and gateways. Contoso is also using Microsoft 365 and Azure for file management options at the user and file share levels.

Most of Contoso's employees are using Windows 10 devices, and they often work from remote locations. All the employees are using Microsoft 365 apps. Users from different departments are using different applications that require multiple images to be created. The Contoso IT director is aware that image management is time consuming and requires management of the applications and Windows updates for each image.

Contoso is considering using the new Microsoft application delivery technology, MSIX app attach, to separate applications from primary images. As a senior administrator, you've been asked to adopt the application delivery method and to use MSIX app attach in your Azure Virtual Desktop environment.

In this module, you'll learn the purpose and benefits of MSIX and MSIX app attach. You'll also learn how to deploy MSIX app attach.

After completing this module, you'll be able to transform existing applications with the MSIX packaging tool and manage MSIX app attach.
