You can use the **message trace** feature in Exchange Online to track email messages through Exchange Online. Under **mail flow**, go to **message trace**. 

By default, the message trace feature tracks all messages sent or received by your organization in the last 48 hours. You can change the time range and filter by sender and recipient to find the specific messages you want to trace. Message traces over seven days old can only be downloaded as a .CSV file.
 
Once you have the message that youâ€™re looking for, select the message and click **Details**. You'll see information about the message and instructions on how to resolve any issues.
 
When a trace is completed, you'll get an email where you can  download message traces (as a .CSV file) for items that are more than seven days old.
