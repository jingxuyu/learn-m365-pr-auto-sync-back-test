quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "An email message for Holly Dickson at Contoso is subject to two retention policies. The first retention policy is unscoped and deletes items after five years. The second retention policy is scoped to specific mailboxes, including Holly's mailbox. It deletes items after three years. What happens to the email message?"
    choices:
    - content: "The email message is permanently deleted after five years"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This action isn't the outcome for this scenario."
    - content: "The email message is permanently deleted after three years"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct. The email message is permanently deleted after three years. Why? Because the deletion action from the scoped retention policy takes precedence over the org-wide retention policy."
    - content: "It can't be determined at this level when the document will be permanently deleted"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. The outcome of this scenario can be determined because one of the retention policies is scoped for a specific instance and the other isn't."
