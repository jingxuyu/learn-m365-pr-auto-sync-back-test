## Collaborate leveraging Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 is the productivity cloud designed to help each of us achieve what matters, in our work and life, with best-in-class Office apps, intelligent cloud services, and advanced security. Microsoft Teams is part of Microsoft 365, meaning your collaboration experience in Teams will be integrated with the files, information, and services your team needs to get things done. If you're using Teams for work, school, or government, an IT administrator can typically verify if you have Microsoft Teams as part of Microsoft 365. To access Teams as part of Microsoft 365, you'll need to sign in with your work, school, or government account. To take advantage of advanced features like longer meeting times, you’ll want to use Microsoft Teams as part of Microsoft 365.

If you don’t have Microsoft 365 and you don’t use a business or school account, you can get a basic, free version of Microsoft Teams. All you need is a Microsoft account.
