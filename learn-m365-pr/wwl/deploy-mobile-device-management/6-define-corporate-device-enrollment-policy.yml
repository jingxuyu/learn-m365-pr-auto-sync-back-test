  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Northwind Traders uses Basic Mobility and Security as its MDM authority. Northwind had several devices whose MDM certificates expired over a year ago. The certificates were never renewed. What was the effect on the devices?"
    choices:
    - content: "They were automatically removed from Basic Mobility and Security 90 days after certificate expiration"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This action isn't what happened to the devices. Try again."
    - content: "They were automatically removed from Intune 180 days after certificate expiration"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. This certificate is used to communicate with Intune, even if you're using Basic Mobility and Security (remember, Basic Mobility and Security is hosted by the Intune service and includes a subset of Intune services). The certificate is renewed automatically when the device communicates with Intune. If the certificate expires, the device is no longer managed by MDM. If the certificate isn't renewed, the device is automatically removed from Intune after 180 days."
    - content: "The users could still access Microsoft 365 email and documents, but the devices were no longer managed by MDM"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Devices must be managed before users can access company resources or manage settings on those devices. When the certificates expired, the devices were no longer managed by MDM. As a result, the devices could no longer access Microsoft 365 email and documents. Try again."
