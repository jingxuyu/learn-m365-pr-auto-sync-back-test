  questions:
  - content: "When using KQL to build a query where you want to filter the table to a subset of rows that satisfy the predicate, what function would you use?"
    choices:
    - content: "`summarize`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Incorrect. This command will produce a table that aggregates the content of the input table."
    - content: "`where`"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's right! When you are building a query, it is important to limit the rows you are working with to a specific subset. The `where` command will let you do that."
    - content: "`limit`"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. This command will return up to the specified number of rows."
  - content: "When constructing queries, you can use a built-in schema reference to obtain information about the contents of the schema. Which built-in schema would you use to obtain the type of data contained in a table and the source of the data?"
    choices:
    - content: "Table description"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Correct! This built-in schema provides information on the type of data contain in the table."
    - content: "Columns"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That isn't right. This built-in schema will only provide you with information on the columns in the table."
    - content: "Action types"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Not quite. This built-in schema only returns values if the table contains an ActionType column, and provides the event types supported by the table."
  - content: "When using a custom detection rule, what is the quota limit applied to every query result set?"
    choices:
    - content: "1,000 rows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The quota limit for a query is much higher than 1,000 rows."
    - content: "10,000 rows"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "Each query can return up to 10,000 records."
    - content: "100,000 rows"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Try again. The quota limit for a query is a lot lower than 100,000 rows"
