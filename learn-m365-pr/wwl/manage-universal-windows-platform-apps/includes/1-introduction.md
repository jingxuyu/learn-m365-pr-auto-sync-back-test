The Microsoft Store is where you acquire Universal Windows apps. Typically, these apps do not consume much memory or have excessive processor demands. In Windows 8.1, Universal Windows apps run in full-screen mode in the new Windows UI. In Windows 10 and later, Universal Windows apps run in resizable windows similar to traditional desktop apps.

It is important that you know how to manage user access to the Microsoft Store, which enables you to control the installation and use of these applications. Windows 10 introduced the Microsoft Store for Business where enterprises can create their own private section of the Microsoft Store that contains pre-approved and custom applications.
