The last element to define for an OKR is projects.  As you know, projects are the specific work efforts or outputs that help to enable the success of the outcomes defined for the business in the form of key results.  This is when we’ll ask the third question.

## *“What do we need to do to be successful?”*

We recommend time-boxing this part of the process to 15 minutes because it can be easy to dedicate a large amount of time around projects, thinking through resourcing, scheduling, etc. and not get to the other OKRs.

The goal is to identify the major work items, provide clarity on who is involved and get next steps to continue conversation.  

Let’s look at the final part of our scenario to see how that happens.

|Coach   |Attendees   |
|---------|---------|
| *What do we need to do to be successful?*|If we want to increase the revenue per head of each of our sellers, we need to really focus on enablement. | 
|*What specific area of sales enablement do you think will have the biggest impact?*| We’ve created a series of new multi-solution sales plays that include Surface and have seen great traction, but how would we know what will have the biggest impact?|
| *You won’t know 100% what will have the biggest impact, otherwise this conversation would be easy.   Part of creating and defining your OKRs is making a bet on what will work and learning when it does or doesn’t.* | Ok, got it.  These sales plays have been a huge effort to create and implement and we believe they'll make a large splash on our customer base.| 
|*Great, let’s mark that down as a key initiative.  Who will be leading that effort?* | Lisa will be driving that forward. |
|*Great, Lisa can you take the action of bringing the appropriate group together to start executing on that enablement?* | |

As you see, the conversation around projects is brief, but with a clear path toward next steps.  Avoid spending too much time in creating, assigning, and delving deep into projects.

We don't have a rubric for Projects as they aren't a core part of the OKR, however they're crucial in helping teams understand how the work will get done to enable OKR success.

## Scenario example

Let’s apply this rubric to the projects we reached in our scenario example.

**Objective: Transform Surface to be an enterprise business** 

- Key Result: Increase our revenue per head across Surface sellers by 15%

- Key Result: Onboard 15 new Surface partners

- Key Result: Baseline our Enterprise MAU penetration with a target of 30%

- Key Result: Grow our multi-national customer pipeline by 500 customers

- Project: *Multi-solution Sales Enablement*

- Project: *Multi-national Marketing Campaigns*

- Project: *Enterprise MAU Telemetry*
  
Now that we've completed each of the three key questions, we've been able to guide the team into a completed OKR and set of projects.

Focusing on getting a team to **done** is critical to showcase a great example of what an OKR alongside appropriate projects looks like.
