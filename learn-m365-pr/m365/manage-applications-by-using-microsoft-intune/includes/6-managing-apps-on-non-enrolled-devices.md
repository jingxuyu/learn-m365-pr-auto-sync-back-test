There are many ways that applications can be made available to your users today. They can be deployed from Intune either as Required or Available or users can directly install apps from public stores.

Apps that are installed directly from public stores are unmanaged. Apps that are deployed by Intune are managed. For managed apps, IT has direct control over deployment, ongoing management (such as inventory or updates), and selective wipe of the apps and their associated data.

An unmanaged app is any app available on Windows, Android and iOS. Intune doesn't have any control over the distribution, management, or selective wipe of these apps. Intune MAM provides additional capabilities to protect managed apps by offering an additional layer of data protection.

## Updates for unenrolled devices

To receive app updates on devices that aren't enrolled with Intune, device users must go to their organization's Company Portal and manually install app updates.

Users can then use either the Company Portal app or go to the Intune Company Portal website at [https://portal.manage.microsoft.com](https://portal.manage.microsoft.com/) on any of their devices and install the application without needing the device to be enrolled in Intune. The Company Portal app will not prompt users to enroll their devices if the app is configured to not require enrollment.
