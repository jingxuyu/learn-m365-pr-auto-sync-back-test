Compliance Manager performs the following key activities:
- **Real-time risk assessment**. In the Compliance Manager dashboard you can view a summary of your compliance posture against the data protection regulatory requirements that are relevant to your organization, in the context of using Microsoft cloud services. The dashboard provides you with your compliance score, which helps you make appropriate compliance decisions.
- **Actionable insights**. These insights help you understand the responsibility that you and Microsoft share in meeting compliance standards. For components that Microsoft manages, you can see the control implementation and testing details, test date, and results. For components that you manage, you can see recommendations for appropriate actions and guidance on how to implement them.
- **Simplified compliance**. Compliance Manager can help you simplify processes to achieve compliance. It provides control management tools that you can use to assign tasks to your teams. You can also generate reports instead of collecting information from multiple teams. This tool also enables you to perform proactive assessments when needed.
