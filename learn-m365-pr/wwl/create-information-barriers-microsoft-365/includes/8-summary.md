Microsoft 365 enables communication and collaboration across different teams within an organization. However, sometimes it's necessary to restrict these services so they don't create a conflict for the organization. These scenarios often include conflict of interest situations where the information shared could interfere with business ethics or business practices. Microsoft 365 addresses this situation by enabling organizations to create information barriers.

This module examined how Information barriers enable administrators to restrict communication and collaboration between certain teams to safeguard the internal information. You learned how information barriers are designed to prevent certain segments of users from communicating with each other. They also allow specific segments to communicate only with certain other segments. This module explained how information barrier policies can help an organization maintain compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations, and avoid potential conflicts of interest.

This module explored the components of information barriers. Particular focus was paid to understanding how information barrier modes strengthen who can be added to or removed from a Team, OneDrive account, and SharePoint site.
