Understanding the components of the Windows Startup architecture can help identify issues with clients that won't boot up properly. Rolling back drivers, recovering from a restore point, and resetting the PC are common steps that can be taken to fix startup issues. The Windows Recovery Environment allows you to access and modify configurations to a Windows client that won't start. The boot menu allows Windows to start with alternate configurations, such as safe mode, to assist in troubleshooting. Tools such as the System Configuration tool and BCDEdit can also be used to modify startup settings.
