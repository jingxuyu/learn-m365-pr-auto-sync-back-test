A voicemail can be sent to an Office 365 Group.  The creation of Office 365 groups is not included in this training; however, the assignment of an Office 365 Group to a Microsoft Teams Voicemail is present.

Voicemail can be used if the number of maximum calls is reached the call can be either **Disconnected** or **Redirect this call** to a voicemail and the voicemail will be attributed to an Office 365 Group.

Likewise, if a Call time out handling, if the call isn't answered within wait time, it will be **Disconnected** or **Redirect this call** to option depending on what you select.

- **Redirect this call to** - This can be to a Person in the organization, Voice App such as a resource account (auto attendant or call queue), External phone number, or a voicemail. The voicemail can be configured to go to an Office 365 Group, the group is searched for and selected.

- **Transcription** - Transcription of the voicemail can be configured for on or off.

- **Announcement** - When the voicemail message is played it can be an audio file, either an MP3, WAV, or WMA. File must be less than 5 MB, or a drafted greeting message can be played.

Please leave your name, phone number, and reason for your call after the beep."
