Teams devices complement your voice deployment by providing hardware that provides a consistent, familiar experience like a physical phone handset to make calls and allows more than just voice calling from handsets and meeting rooms. Teams devices provide the high-quality audio experience for Teams calls, and when enabled for voice scenarios, allow non-Teams calling and meeting experiences over a voice call to seamlessly integrate.
