The storage functionality in Windows can give you an overview of what types of files the volumes are storing. When you first create a volume, you typically create new files and folders on a volumeâ€™s available free space in contiguous blocks. This provides an optimized file system environment. As the volume becomes full, the availability of contiguous blocks diminishes. This can lead to suboptimal performance.

This module explores file system fragmentation and the tools that you can use to reduce fragmentation. You also will see how Windows can compress files to take up less space on the hard disk. You will see how you can configure disk quotas to monitor and control the use of disk space.
