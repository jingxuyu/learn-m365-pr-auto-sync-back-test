  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Administrator for Contoso, Holly Dickson finished running an audit log search. Holly knows there will be over 100,000 entries in the search results. How can Holly export all these records?"
    choices:
    - content: "When running the search, select the \"Download all results\" option"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. These locations are where users assign personal tags. Try again."
    - content: "Run the Get-AdminAuditLogResults PowerShell cmdlet to save the results to a CSV file on the local computer"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. You can't use PowerShell to export the search results. Try again."
    - content: "Run multiple searches with smaller date ranges"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. You can only download 50,000 entries from a single audit log search. To export more than this limit, you must use a date range to reduce the number of audit log records. You'll have to run multiple searches with smaller date ranges to export more than 50,000 entries."
