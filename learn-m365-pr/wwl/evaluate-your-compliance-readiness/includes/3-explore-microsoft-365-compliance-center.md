### Compliance Manager

Compliance Manager is a feature in the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center. Its purpose is to help organizations manage their compliance requirements with greater ease and convenience. Compliance Manager can help organizations throughout their compliance journey:

 -  from taking inventory of their data protection risks
 -  to managing the complexities of implementing controls
 -  to staying current with regulations and certifications
 -  to reporting to auditors

Compliance Manager helps simplify compliance and reduce risk by providing:

 -  Pre-built assessments for common industry and regional standards and regulations, or custom assessments to meet an organization's unique compliance needs (available assessments depend on [an organization's licensing agreement](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance?azure-portal=true)).
 -  Workflow capabilities to help organizations efficiently complete their risk assessments through a single tool.
 -  Detailed step-by-step guidance on suggested improvement actions to help organizations follow the standards and regulations that are most relevant for them. For actions that are managed by Microsoft, implementation details and audit results will be displayed.
 -  A risk-based compliance score to help organizations understand their compliance posture by measuring their progress in completing improvement actions.

The Compliance Manager dashboard is designed to provide an organization an at-a-glance view of its current compliance posture. It displays an organization's current compliance score. The dashboard also helps organizations see what needs attention, and guides them to key improvement actions.
