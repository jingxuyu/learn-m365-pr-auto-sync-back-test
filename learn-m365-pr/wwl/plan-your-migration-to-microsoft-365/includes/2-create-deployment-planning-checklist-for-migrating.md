When moving your organization to Microsoft 365, it’s essential that you plan every step down to the finest detail. This effort should include identifying each objective, who will be executing those objectives, and the due date that each objective must be completed by.

Microsoft supports this effort by providing the Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365. The purpose of this checklist is to help you organize, plan, and prepare for a migration to Microsoft 365. The phases and steps in the checklist are aligned with the guidance provided by Microsoft’s Onboarding Center.

The Deployment Planning Checklist for Microsoft 365, which is adaptable to any organizational needs, consists of the following five objectives:
