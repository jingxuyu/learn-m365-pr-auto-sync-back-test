Conforming to industry and governmental regulations is critical to the successful operation of any organization. This module explores the tools Microsoft 365 has to help ensure an organization's regulatory compliance. The focus of this module is on the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center and formulating an organization's compliance score.

The following statistics reflect the challenges faced by organizations in today's working environment:

 -  140+ days between infiltration and detection.
 -  4.2 billion records compromised in the last year.
 -  50% of employee time is spent in collaborative work environment,
 -  78% of employees use mobile devices for work.
 -  50% year-over-year growth in electronic data.
 -  45% of organizations lack data governance, leaving them open to litigation and data security risks.
 -  87% of senior managers admit to using personal accounts for work.
 -  88% of organizations are no longer confident they detect and prevent loss of sensitive data.

Organizations traditionally had their own networks, each of which was protected by a firewall. This design enabled them to protect the data, devices, and users within their networks. As technology has evolved, many organizations have implemented hybrid environments, with data being stored on-premises and in the cloud. Organizations are increasingly using cloud applications and cloud services such as Microsoft 365 and Azure. They also have users external to their networks, using different devices to access that data. So the challenge for organizations today is to protect that information, and protect the devices and users that aren't connected to their networks.

In this module, you'll examine how Microsoft 365 addresses these challenges to information protection and governance. Its approach provides comprehensive policies to protect and govern organizations' most important data, throughout its life cycle. You'll learn how Microsoft achieves this goal through a four prong approach:

 -  Unified approach to discover, classify, and label.
 -  Automatically apply policy-based actions.
 -  Proactive monitoring to identify risks.
 -  Broad coverage across locations and applications.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center and how to access it.
 -  Describe the purpose and function of the Microsoft Compliance Score.
 -  Explain how an organization's compliance score is determined.
 -  Explain how assessments are used to formulate compliance scores.
