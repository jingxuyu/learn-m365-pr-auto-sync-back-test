Managing mail flow for Exchange Online is the easiest way of configuring mail flow because it’s all configured by default and managed by Microsoft. As such, mail flow in Exchange Online is considered a “black box” because mail flow is handled internally within Exchange Online with no assistance from Exchange Administrators. While administrators can create other connectors to improve the organization's mail flow, they have no other impact on the mail flow process.

Because mail flow in Exchange Online is designed for ease of use, the only requirements an organization must configure in an Exchange Online deployment are:

 -  The organization's DNS MX record must point inbound to Exchange Online.
 -  Internet SMTP email must be sent out directly from Exchange Online Protection to the recipient’s mail server.

### Manage mail flow in Exchange Online

Managing the mail flow for Exchange Online includes the creation of connectors, accepted domains, and optional mail flow rules. These features can be created in the Exchange Admin Center and with Exchange Online PowerShell.

There are also several features to configure in the Microsoft 365 Defender portal to control the data loss prevention filtering for email flowing through your organization and anti-spam, anti-spoofing, and anti-malware settings.

### Manage connectors in Exchange Online

Exchange Online was developed in a way that mail flow is configured automatically for the most common scenarios. However, there may be scenarios where you need to create a connector. The following table provides an overview of these scenarios.
