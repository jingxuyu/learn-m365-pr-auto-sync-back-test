By moving to the cloud an organization can gain many benefits including flexibility for users, performance, and cost saving. To improve flexibility to users, cloud resources become globally available to the users, but it is essential that critical data is still protected.

A Cloud Access Security Broker provides this protection for an organization by discovering and monitoring IT use by users, and limiting access to sensitive resources.

Microsoft Cloud App Security is a sophisticated Cloud Access Security Broker that provides centralized management for both Microsoft and non-Microsoft solutions. Traffic is routed via a revers proxy infrastructure which minimizes user impact while maintaining the highest level of control.

## Cloud Access Security Brokers use cases

### Addressing Shadow IT in your organization

Shadow IT refers to apps and services in your organization that have been deployed outside of the control of the central IT department. Shadow IT can account for more than 60% of cloud services in an organization, but a CASB can help mitigate the risks posed by shadow IT by performing the following tasks:

- Discover all cloud apps and services used in your organization.
- Assess the risk and compliance of your cloud apps.
- Govern discovered cloud apps and explore enterprise-ready alternatives.
- Enable continuous monitoring to automatically detect new and risky cloud apps.
- Detect when data is being exfiltrated from your corporate apps.
- Discover OAuth apps that have access to your environment

### Protect your information in the cloud

Large amounts of data is now stored in the cloud and employees often have cloud storage before their company has implemented cloud-based systems.

Cloud based services such as Microsoft Office 365 provide excellent productivity benefits and often result in sensitive information being uploaded and shared. Cloud storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive provide high availability, disaster recovery and portability for documents, which will often include sensitive data. Collaboration tools such as Microsoft Teams enable groups to work effectively together but make it straightforward to share sensitive information. With an increasingly mobile workforce, users can access cloud-based sensitive data from a personal or shared device, but this can result in sensitive files being downloaded to unmanaged devices.

A CASB enables you to identify files that contain sensitive information. These files can then be encrypted or blocked from sharing externally, external collaborators can be blocked, links can have time limits, messages containing sensitive data can be blocked in real-time, and the device state of devices that a user connects to can be detected to prevent the download of sensitive data to unmanaged devices.

Microsoft Cloud App Security can even use Azure Active Directory conditional access polies to determine a user's risk level at login. This risk level can then define the actions that a user can perform and prevent the download, copying, or printing of unauthorized data in real-time.

### Detect and protect against cyberthreats

Cyberthreats are increasingly common and the threat to an organization from attacks including hacking, ransomware, and malware is increasing. A CASB provides a number of methods to protect against cyberthreats:

- Record an audit trail for all user activities across hybrid environments.
- Identify compromised user accounts.
- Detect threats from users inside your organization.
- Detect threats from privileged accounts.
- Identify and revoke access to risky OAuth apps.
- Detect and remediate malware in your cloud apps.

### Assess and protect your IaaS environment

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) can bring huge business benefits, but it can also bring risk. With IaaS server resources, such as storage become Internet-facing and access to these services must be adequately controlled to protect the organization.

A CASB provides a number of methods to protect your IaaS environment. The IaaS environment can be audited to ensure that it is correctly, and securely, configured. User activity can be monitored in real-time to ensure that if compromised accounts, users inside your organization, or privileged accounts have anomalous usage, an alert can be issued so that remedial action can be performed.

Organizations often have many custom apps that access IaaS resources. Microsoft Cloud App Security not only monitors the actions of these custom apps, but also integrates with Azure Active Directory to provide equal levels of visibility across custom apps, cloud apps, and on-premise apps.
