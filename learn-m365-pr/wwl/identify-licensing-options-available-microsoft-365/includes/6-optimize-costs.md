## Optimizing costs

Microsoft 365 helps to optimize costs in a number of ways:

### Vendor license cost consolidation

Consolidating to a single suite/platform can cost much less than choosing different vendors for multiple capabilities.

### IT administration and deployment savings

Microsoft can now be responsible for maintaining your hardware and software. This helps IT transition to higher-value activities.

### Reduce total cost of risk

Improved security can reduce security breaches, protect privacy, and simplify remediation. Compliance solutions help reduce your risk.

### Physical and Travel Expense cost displacement

Reduce office space costs by moving on-site employees to permanent, secure, and remote positions. Enable valuable collaboration while reducing travel &amp; entertainment costs.

### Save on automation and process improvements

Transform and streamline business processes through workflows, dashboards, AI capabilities, and more; making your employees more productive.

### Capital expenditure to operational expenditure cash flow

Change upfront license payments to operating expenses paid over time. Optimize your cash flows by choosing between capital expenses and operational expenses.
