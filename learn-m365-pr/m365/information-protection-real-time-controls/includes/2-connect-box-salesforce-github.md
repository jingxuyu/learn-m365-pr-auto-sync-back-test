Microsoft Cloud App Security is often used to protect Microsoft apps and services such as Office 365 and Azure, but Cloud App Security threat detection policies can also be used for non-Microsoft cloud apps.

Cloud App Security uses APIs from the cloud provider to have visibility and control of the non-Microsoft services. Because these APIs are provided by the cloud provider, the capabilities of each API can differ, and the time taken to perform tasks such as scanning all files might take hours or days.

When a connection is made to a cloud app provider, Cloud App Security will scan users, files, and activities. After this initial scan, Cloud App Security periodically scans users, groups, activities, and files.Â Once a connection is made, you can create Cloud App Security policies.

For more information on the capabilities of Cloud App Security to manage connected apps, see **Connect your Favorite Apps to Microsoft Cloud App Security** in the **Summary** unit of this module.

The steps to connect each cloud app provider to Cloud App Security are similar and the following example uses Box:
