The collaboration tool that you select from M365 will vary depending upon your how your organization works and your business needs. Use the following to help provide some guidance: 

- Find yourself using email most of the time? Then, use groups in Exchange Online/Outlook for email-based collaboration.
- Want to connect across your organization to have company-wide discussions? Use Yammer, the social network for work, to create communities of interest.
- Participating in project work with colleagues? Use Microsoft Teams, the chat-based workspace.
- Want to make calls and hold online meetings? Use Skype for Business for voice and video meetings on any device.
- Need to store and share team files? Use SharePoint for team sites and OneDrive or Sharepoint for file collaboration.
