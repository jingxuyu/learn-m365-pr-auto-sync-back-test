    title: Check your knowledge
    questions:
    - content: "Microsoft 365 Apps is available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Which version should you install?"
      choices:
      - content: "You should always install the 32-bit version."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. 32-bit isn't always the best version to install."
      - content: "You should always install the 64-bit version."
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. 64-bit isn't always the best version to install."
      - content: "Install the 64-bit version unless you have 32-bit dependencies."
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct. Microsoft 365 Apps *is* available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, but we recommend using the 64-bit version unless you have 32-bit dependencies."
    - content: "Microsoft 365 Apps and Office 2019 clients use which installation technology?"
      choices:
      - content: "UWP"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect, Microsoft 365 Apps and Office 2019 clients use Click-to-Run installation technology."
      - content: "Click-to-Run"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct, Microsoft 365 Apps and Office 2019 clients use Click-to-Run installation technology."
      - content: "MSIX"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect, Microsoft 365 Apps and Office 2019 clients use Click-to-Run installation technology."
    - content: "Which of the following distribution tools does **NOT** work with MSI-based packages?"
      choices:
      - content: "System Center Configuration Manager"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. Configuration Manager is one of the most common tools used to deliver MSI-based applications."
      - content: "Desktop App Assure"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. Desktop App Assure is a program that fixes incompatible business apps at no cost to you - it's not a distribution tool."
      - content: "Office Deployment Tool"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct. The Office Deployment Tool doesn't work with MSI-based packages to deliver your business apps. It's used to install Click-to-Run packages of Office."
    - content: "Which approach would you use to deliver business apps?"
      choices:
      - content: "Application deployment in Configuration Manager"
        isCorrect: true
        explanation: "That's correct. Use Configuration Manager to deploy your business apps."
      - content: "Click-to-Run"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. Use Click-to-Run to package and install Office, not your business apps."
      - content: "Offline package injection"
        isCorrect: false
        explanation: "That's incorrect. Use Configuration Manager, Microsoft Intune, and other software distribution tools to deploy business apps. You can use package injection into offline images to keep drivers, features, and a limited number of application runtimes up to date, but not apps themselves."
