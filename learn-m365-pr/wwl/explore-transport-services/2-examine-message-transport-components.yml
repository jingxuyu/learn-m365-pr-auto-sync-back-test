quiz:
  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "Which transport service component is responsible for making routing decisions?"
    choices:
    - content: "Submission queue"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. When messages are received by the Transport service, they're placed in the submission queue. Messages wait in the submission queue until they're processed by the categorizer for delivery. Try again."
    - content: "Pickup directory"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. Messages can enter the message transport pipeline by being placed in the Pickup directory or Replay directory on a Mailbox server. You can use the Pickup directory to submit a properly formatted text file as a message for delivery. Try again."
    - content: "Categorizer"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. The categorizer is the component that's responsible for making routing decisions. Each message is retrieved from the submission queue and processed by the categorizer to determine how a message should be delivered. Once the message delivery process has been determined, the categorizer places the message in a delivery queue."
