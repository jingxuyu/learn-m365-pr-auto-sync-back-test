  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Enterprise Admin for Lucerne Publishing, Patti Fernandez wants to search the unified audit log to view user and administrator activity in Lucerne's Microsoft 365 tenant. After running an audit log search, Patti realized that no user activity in Exchange Online is appearing in the search results for several of the users who were targeted for tracking. What could be the cause of the missing activity?"
    choices:
    - content: "The users were not assigned the Audit Logs role on the Permissions page in Exchange Online"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This role enables users to search the Microsoft 365 audit log. It doesn't affect what data is collected in a search. Try again."
    - content: "Mailbox audit logging wasn't turned on for each user mailbox"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Mailbox audit logging must be turned on for each user mailbox before user activity in Exchange Online is logged."
    - content: "Patti didn't turn on audit log searching by running the Set-AdminAuditLogConfig cmdlet in Exchange Online Powershell"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This cmdlet is one way of turning on audit log searching. However, it was already turned on, otherwise Patti wouldn't have been able to run an audit log search. Try again."
