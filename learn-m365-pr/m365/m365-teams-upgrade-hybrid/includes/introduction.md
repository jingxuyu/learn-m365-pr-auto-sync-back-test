Setting up hybrid connectivity is the first step in moving your on-premises environment to the cloud.

If you have on-premises Skype for Business users that are also using Teams side by side, those users do not have the ability to interoperate with Skype for Business users or communicate with users in federated organizations from their Teams client. To do so, you must move these users from Skype for Business on-premises to the cloud, which requires configuring Skype for Business hybrid mode. In addition, these users should be in TeamsOnly mode to ensure all incoming calls and chats land in the user's Teams client.

You'll also need to set up hybrid connectivity and move all users to the cloud before you decommission your on-premises Skype for Business deployment. With hybrid connectivity set up, you can move your users to the cloud on your schedule. With direct routing, you can use your on-premises voice infrastructure while you move to the cloud and after your migration is complete.
