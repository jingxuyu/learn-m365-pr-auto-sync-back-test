Organizations have sensitive information under their control such as financial data, proprietary data, credit card numbers, health records, and social security numbers. To help protect this sensitive data and reduce risk, they need a way to prevent their users from inappropriately sharing it with people who shouldn't have it. This practice is called data loss prevention (DLP).

In Microsoft 365, you implement data loss prevention by defining and applying DLP policies. With a DLP policy, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive items across:

 -  Microsoft 365 services such as Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive
 -  Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint
 -  Windows 10 endpoints
 -  non-Microsoft cloud apps
 -  on-premises file shares and on-premises SharePoint

DLP policy templates are built on top of rules that are a combination of conditions and actions. DLP policies support a full range of rules, and you can modify any of the built-in DLP policy templates by configuring conditions and actions to meet your specific requirements.<br>

This module examines the process of using the **New DLP Policy** wizard in the Security and Compliance Center to create a DLP policy based on a built-in template.

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

 -  Describe the different built-in templates that are available for creating DLP policies.
 -  Determine how to choose the correct locations for a DLP policy.
 -  Configure the correct rules for protecting content.
 -  Enable and review the DLP policy.
