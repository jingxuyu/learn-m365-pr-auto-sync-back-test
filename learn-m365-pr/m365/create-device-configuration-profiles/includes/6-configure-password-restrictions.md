As mentioned previously, device configuration profiles are groups of settings that enable or disable different device capabilities or restrictions. You determine the specific capabilities or restrictions and apply the settings across the devices connected to your organization. You also determine the groups of users and devices that require these capabilities and settings. 

Device restrictions control security, hardware, data sharing, and more settings on the devices. For example, you can create a device restriction profile that manages access to the App store, restricts certain apps from being installed on the device, prevents device users from using the device camera, or requires an access password for the device.

Device restrictions are supported for devices running the following operating systems:
- Android device administrator
- Android Enterprise
- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
- Windows 11
- Windows 10
- Windows 10 Team
