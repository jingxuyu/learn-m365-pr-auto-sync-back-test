## Assessments summary

The **Assessments** page lists the assessments your organization is tracking and their status. Assessments combine actions Microsoft takes on your behalf with actions you take to protect your data and achieve compliance. You can also add assessments, sort assessments by selected columns, view assessments by group, and use the filter and search functionality to customize your view.

## Assessment details page

Clicking an individual assessment provides more details on that assessment in a series of four pages. Each page's title and a short description follows:

- **Overview:** Dashboard dedicated to the assessment that includes information about your progress toward completion, key improvement actions, and status. You will also find links to where you can see more detail, and the option to generate an assessment report.
- **Controls:** View information about each control included in the assessment, both visually and in a list, grouped by control family.
- **Your improvement actions:** View improvement actions managed by your organization. You can select an improvement action to edit its status and view implementation guidance.
- **Microsoft actions:** Review the status of improvement actions managed by Microsoft. Select an improvement action to view details, including implementation and testing notes.
