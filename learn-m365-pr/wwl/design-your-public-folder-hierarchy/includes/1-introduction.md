Exchange Server and Exchange Online fully support public folders. Public folders are designed for shared access and provide an easy and effective way to collect, organize, and share information with other people in your workgroup or organization. Public folders help organize content in a deep hierarchy thatâ€™s easy to browse.

Public folders can also be used as an archiving method for distribution groups. When you mail-enable a public folder and add it as a member of the distribution group, email sent to the group is automatically added to the public folder for later reference.

This module examines the use of public folders in Exchange. It reviews the planning considerations for deploying public folders, and it explores alternatives to public folders.
