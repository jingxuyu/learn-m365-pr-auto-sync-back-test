            surface boosted news from SharePoint. However, the Feed is

            and communications about their region or role."

      explanation: "Resources tab in Viva Connections
            allows users to access sites and pages, which can include news from
            Teams. However, Resources tab doesn't provide a constant stream of news and
            announcements targeted toward employee groups based on
            region and role."
  - content: "Which approach below best demonstrates recommended practices to announce, launch and scale Viva Connections?"

      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "An all-company meeting is a great channel for sharing announcements, but it's unlikely you'll reach everyone in your organization in one meeting. Sending an email is another effective method of communication but doesn't provide enough guidance to influence long term change."
    - content: "Plan to send out a series of emails and posts in Teams that include tutorial videos."
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "Systematic communications and tutorial content are
        vital components to the adoption of Viva Connections, but this
        plan may exclude people who don't have access to a dedicated
        desktop or mobile device at work."
    - content: "Plan to use various communications methods that reach everyone at the organization and highlight hands-on training opportunities, digital resources, and ongoing support from champions in your organization. Find early adopters and champions and create ways to extend their enthusiasm to the rest of the organization."

      explanation: "This plan best incorporates known success factors like
        using various communication methods, providing training
        opportunities, and the continuing to engage with Viva
        Connections champions."
