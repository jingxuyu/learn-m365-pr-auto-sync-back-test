If you have a device that's running an older version of Windows, you can upgrade it to Windows 10 to benefit from features such as improved security, better management, and integration with cloud services. In-place upgrade is the recommended way for upgrading your device to Windows 10. It's well-tested and easy to run. During the upgrade, the existing operating system on the device is replaced with Windows 10, while settings, apps, and data are preserved.

In most cases, an upgrade is completed without any issue. In rare cases, an issue or error may occur. For example, an issue can occur if you want to upgrade from a 32-bit to 64-bit operating system version and there's insufficient disk space for the upgrade. Or, if the device isn't compatible with Windows 10. In such a case, the setup process will display an error message, and more detailed information is written in the setup log file.

In this module, you'll learn about the Windows 10 upgrade process. You'll also learn about the most common Windows 10 upgrade errors, what causes them, and how to troubleshoot them using Windows 10 log files. The module also examines common upgrade error codes and how to resolve them.
