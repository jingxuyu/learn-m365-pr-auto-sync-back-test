Data classification and protection are some of today's biggest challenges to information security. The first step of your information protection journey is to find out how your organization uses data.

Suppose you work for a company of legal representatives. You handle highly sensitive and personal information for your clients and they trust you to secure this information effectively. You also operate in several different legal jurisdictions and must comply with information protection legislation in each one. As the head of IT, you want to know if your company is vulnerable to attack and are compliant with all the relevant regulations.

In this module, you'll learn about the lifecycle of information in your organization and how Microsoft software helps to protect it.
