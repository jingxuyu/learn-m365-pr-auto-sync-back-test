OneDrive is the Microsoft 365 service that allows users to access, share, and collaborate on files from anywhere. OneDrive allows users to view files within a browser, share and find content, sync that content so they can access it offline, and empowers your organization to control, secure, and retain that content when necessary. 

OneDrive is included in Microsoft 365 and Office 365 plans, in SharePoint plans, and can also be purchased as a standalone plan and plans provide different storage pace per user from 1 GB   to unlimited. For subscriptions with 5 or more users (any combination of qualifying plans), Microsoft will initially provide 1 TB per user, which admins can increase to up to 5 TB per user. 

OneDrive provides users:
- **Anywhere access to their files**. Store, access, and discover shared and private files from across Microsoft 365, including files from Teams, SharePoint, and synced from any device. Create, view, edit, and share files on the go with the OneDrive mobile app. Easily access files across accounts while also being able to scan paper documents, work receipts, or business cards directly into OneDrive.
- **Seamless collaboration with files**. Share and work together in real-time with anyone inside or outside the organization. Securely share files and work together in real-time using Word, Excel, and PowerPoint across web, mobile, and desktop. 
- **Security and protection for files**. Back up and protect files with OneDrive in a compliant solution. Easily recover files from accidental deletions or malicious attacks. Administrators can manage security policies to help keep information safe.

OneDrive employs a sync app to manage files on your Windows PC, Mac, iOS, or Android devices.    OneDrive is included as part of your organizationâ€™s subscription to Microsoft 365, Office 365, or as a standalone product. As an IT Professional, you have enhanced capabilities to provide security and compliance for those files in OneDrive. 

The core functionality of OneDrive includes:
- Securely storing files in the cloud up to 5 TB and beyond based on subscriptions.
- Utilizing the OneDrive sync app to view, search, and bring files onto a device from across Microsoft 365.
- Sharing files stored in OneDrive with people inside and outside your organization.
