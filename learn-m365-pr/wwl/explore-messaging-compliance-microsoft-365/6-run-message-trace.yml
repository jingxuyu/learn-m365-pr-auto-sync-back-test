  title: "Check your knowledge"
  questions:
  - content: "As the Messaging administrator for Fabrikam, Holly Spencer wants to run a message trace on message data that was created over a month ago. Where can Holly view this data?"
    choices:
    - content: "In the Exchange admin center"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This location isn't where Holly can view the message trace results. Try again."
    - content: "In the Microsoft 365 Defencer portal"
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: "That's incorrect. This location isn't where Holly can view the message trace results. Try again."
    - content: "In a downloadable .CSV file"
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: "That's correct. Trace data is available for the past 90 days. If a message is older than seven days, you can only view the results in a downloadable .CSV file. Since the message data that Holly is investigating is over a month old, Holly must download the .CSV file that's generated from the message trace to view the results."
