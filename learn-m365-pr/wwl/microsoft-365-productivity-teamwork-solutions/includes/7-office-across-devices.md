Microsoft 365 has the tools you need to work anytime, anywhere, on any device. It has the same Microsoft Office apps you've used for years, plus all the benefits of the cloud.

 -  **Across devices**. Depending on the plan, you can install Microsoft 365 apps on up to five PCs or Macs and five tablets (iPad, Windows, or Android). If you change devices, you can transfer the installation. You can also view and edit files on Apple and Android devices with Microsoft 365 mobile apps.
 -  **Always up to date**. Your familiar apps are now always up to date. You don't need to spend time installing updates, or worrying about when features will be released because it's all done for you. So you are always working with the most current features, and so are all your colleagues.
 -  **Work intelligently**. Microsoft 365 apps include intelligent capabilities to help you get better results. Intelligent services are built into apps, such as Researcher and Editor in Word, Designer in PowerPoint, and Insight Services to analyze data. These intelligent tools help you work better, whatever you are working on.
