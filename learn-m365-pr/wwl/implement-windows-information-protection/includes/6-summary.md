This module examined how to implement Windows Information Protection (WIP) within Microsoft 365. WIP helps to protect against potential data leakage without otherwise interfering with the employee experience. In this module, you learned how WIP helps to protect enterprise apps and data against accidental data leak on enterprise-owned devices and personal devices that employees bring to work without requiring changes to your environment or other apps.

Once you've protected your Microsoft 365 and Azure services, you must still secure your client devices against a possible data leakage. With the increase of employee-owned devices in the enterprise, there’s also an increasing risk of accidental data leakage through apps and services, like email, social media, and the public cloud, all of which are outside the enterprise’s control. For example, when an employee sends the latest engineering pictures from their personal email account, copies and pastes product info into a tweet, or saves an in-progress sales report to their public cloud storage.

In this module, you learned how Windows Information Protection can protect your clients to prevent the loss of work-related company data. You also learned how to plan for WIP policies and how to implement those policies in Windows desktop apps.<br>
